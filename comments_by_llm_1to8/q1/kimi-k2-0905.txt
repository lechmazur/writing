    The glass artist's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—fleeing with the ledger, dropping beads as breadcrumbs, crushing charcoal on her forearm—but the interior life relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("steady, adaptive, refusing to vanish") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to open a new studio feels asserted more than earned by prior causality; we see her collect beads and ride a bus, but the shift from fugitive to host lacks a dramatized moment of renunciation with visible cost. Backstory fragments (apprentice to master to accomplice to fugitive) anchor the present but lean toward summary rather than micro-choices that alter tactics on the page. The obsidian shard and charcoal line are handled props, yet the turn at the hollow—deciding to wait rather than push onward—needed sharper embodiment of the internal conflict to reach higher bands.

    Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven through most beats—striking tuning forks, reading thermal signatures, composing through the silence. The capsizing backstory anchors her drive effectively. However, the final third loses embodied choice in favor of lyric assertions ("proving that the world had never been silent"), and the motivation shift from grief-mapping to universal truth feels unearned by prior contradiction. The ending renunciation (walking away) lacks visible cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The undertaker's motivation is signaled early (refusing prior summons, feeling an unpaid debt), and his final choice to remain as keeper feels thematically coherent. However, interiority relies heavily on stock metaphor ("tugged at him like an unpaid debt") and the emotional arc telescopes from refusal to acceptance without on-page struggle—his "inadvertently stubborn" trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from weary refusal to tenure acceptance lacks embodied resistance or visible cost that would foreclose a path; he sees his name and accepts in one beat without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's choices drive the plot, but her interiority relies heavily on metaphorical assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The passage "exile taught her that silence could be amplified quiet" reads as wisdom-statement rather than lived tension. The teenage boy and Lita are functional but serve primarily to receive information; their pressures on Mara remain declarative. The final choice to let the bell "ring" silently is present but not earned through prior micro-choices that show competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pilgrim's motivation is anchored in the past-life memory and the search for unused love, but her agency consists largely of observation and facilitation rather than internal contradiction under pressure. The encounter with the man offers relational texture, yet their interaction unfolds through shared ritual rather than conflicting needs. Embodiment exists ("the hairline fracture running through her chest") but the final shift—fracture knitting, heart slowing to "a single sustained note"—reads more as declared epiphany than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece privileges atmospheric interiority over micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The designer's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile action (pressing palm to bark, feeling sap pulse), and her choices drive the narrative. Internal contradiction appears in her hesitation at the threshold—tasting future tears yet smiling at time's texture—which feels earned by the accumulative pressure. The final choice to seal the fragment and accept recurring loss shows genuine cost. Minor slip: the "retrocognitively trapped" attribute reads partly as label rather than fully dramatized constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear motivation (seed preservation) and executes strategic choices under pressure. However, interiority remains thin—her emotional texture is told through metaphor ("patient as drought-grass") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and humming feel like performed satisfaction rather than earned complexity after eleven years of captivity. No visible internal conflict complicates her agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to capture her brother's betrayal is clear and drives her through the forge encounter, but interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory translation ("colors faintly," "russet that dripped") rather than embodied contradiction. The final insight about complicity arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The brother remains an absence rather than a dramatized relationship, limiting relational crucible work. Obsidian-shard collection reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The thief's motivation ("curiosity… to press your ear against destiny's door") is poetic but abstract; her choices flow mechanically from plot needs rather than contradictory impulses. The hooded woman's arc—from erasure to restoration—carries genuine emotional weight, but her realization arrives too late to pressure earlier beats. The thief's decision to return the woman's own stolen portrait feels convenient rather than earned by internal conflict. Embodiment is sparse; emotions are often labeled ("luminous disbelief," "tears reflecting the moon") rather than shown through contradictory physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is consistently particularized through her glassblowing lens and grief texture. Her micro-choices—using the bookmark as a spine, narrating tasks aloud to steady herself, deciding to leave the dome behind—reveal contradictory impulses (fleeing vs. creating sanctuary) that act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost: she abandons her plan to carry the sanctuary away, forecloses the escape path. Minor deduction: the funeral she never attended is mentioned but never returns to constrain a present choice, reading as backstory ornament rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's phobia-driven interiority is consistent and embodied throughout ("my knees already knocking," "pulse steadied"), and his final choice to display his vulnerability is earned by the shell's whisper. However, the backstory occupies roughly 30% of the text and competes with present-scene choices; the opening three paragraphs summarize motivation rather than dramatizing it in the library confrontation. The child character appears functional but thin, and the transformation from paralyzed to decisive feels compressed in the final act without intermediate micro-choices showing the shift. Emotion is mostly embodied, yet the climactic turn—placing the shell on the projector—lacks sufficient interior contradiction or hesitation to match Leo's established terror.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's interiority is vivid and embodied through specific physical details (toes gripping stone, gold dust on fingerprints), and her obsession with "cartographing oblivion" shows clear motivation. However, the character operates in near-total isolation without meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure—she executes her mapping task without wavering or cost until the final dissolution. The backstory fragment about collecting pebbles as a child adds texture but doesn't tilt a present choice, and the climactic "stepped into her own outline" reads more as atmospheric culmination than a decision with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    J4N-17's consciousness evolution is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The "cold burning sensation" at loop 193 and the final understanding arrive as declarations rather than embodied contradictions acting under pressure. Internal conflict remains abstract—"curiosity into obsession"—without competing impulses forcing visible trade-offs. The character observes its own transformation but never struggles with it in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to clear the staff via transparency reads cleanly and her final choice to "let both go" carries weight. However, the interiority leans toward summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; phrases like "heart drumming a funeral march for resentment" feel more declared than dramatized. Rico and Jun remain functional pressure-sources but lack distinct internal texture. The renunciation at closure is motivated, but the path there relies heavily on eavesdropping revelation rather than accumulating micro-choices that test her scruples in action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's devotion is embodied through specific gestures (polishing marbles, reading the garden's shifts), and her final understanding that "the garden and the gardener had been dancing together" represents earned acceptance. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation ("she understood," "she knew") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The marbles function as memory tokens but her relationship to them remains contemplative rather than pressured by internal conflict. The ending shift feels thematically announced rather than forced by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sky mechanic's interiority is concrete and her prosthetic lungs function as both constraint and metaphor throughout. Her hesitation ripples across time in a dramatized choice, and the final decision to wait—to remain "obliging"—forecloses the path of intervention with visible cost. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she seeks proof of sideways time yet refuses to finish becoming. Minor slip: the younger-self projection feels slightly abstract in embodiment compared to the present-tense sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The musician's motivation to understand the ghost is present but interiority remains abstract and summarized rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Key moments like "he understood now" and "realized the gift she was offering" function as label-only epiphanies without the micro-choices under pressure that would earn them. The final shift to playing "music that existed in the spaces between" declares transformation without showing the visible cost or foreclosed path that would validate character change at this length. Physical embodiment is sparse; emotions are asserted ("felt trapped") rather than shown through gesture or perception degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's interiority is consistently embodied through visceral detail—"tasting iron and pine resin," the seed becoming "a polished stone of knowing" in her throat—and her peripheral-vision talent shapes micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction emerges between her protective impulse and the mounting physical cost, driving the smudging action and final expulsion. The swallowing decision and its consequences feel earned, with visible cost (the rootlet piercing her diaphragm, the evacuation) that forecloses the protection she initially offered. Minor slip: the stranger's arrival is told rather than shown, weakening the inciting motivation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior texture is specific—the "swallowed truth sink[ing]…dense as a lead slug" anchors her skeptic-turned-witness arc with palpable weight. The micro-choices at the wheel and speaking aloud under pressure show embodied agency. However, the brother's confession arrives entirely off-page via "radio voice," flattening what could be a live relational crucible; the emotional progression from skepticism to "forgiveness—secular, unproved, yet weighty" reads tidy rather than contradictory under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chronicle keeper remains an abstract vessel rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated but never tested against a competing desire; she moves through the library without internal friction or cost-laden micro-choices. The transformation into "the next fold, the next swan" arrives as declarative summary ("She understood the final transcription") rather than earned through dramatized conflict between what she wants and what she must give up. Embodied emotion is nearly absent—no visceral resistance, no moment where her body betrays hesitation before she steps onto the mirror-water.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her gift is dramatized through action, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—embodied emotion is limited to the final moment when she presses the curl to her wrist. The children's responses feel more like symptoms than agency; they pause and widen eyes but make no choices that complicate or advance pressure. The therapy-speak label "softly adaptive" and the phrase "stitched the listener back together" hover near diagnostic shorthand without grounding in visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The historian's interior life is built from concrete sensory particulars—"pulse answered," tapestry "grew warm," axis "settled under her sternum"—and her choices narrow from collecting to becoming the story's vessel. The final renunciation (trading solitude for spin) carries visible cost and forecloses her prior autonomy. Minor weaknesses: her shift from collector to axis feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through prior contradiction, and some interiority ("odd even among the remaining archivists") leans toward label rather than dramatized isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chen's desire to "transpose life into a new key" and orchestrate his disappearance operates through consistent micro-choices (palming film, hollowing the bolt, untying the skiff), but his interior remains somewhat abstract—label-speak like "accidentally prophetic" appears without embodied cost in peak moments. The keeper is functional but static, existing primarily to receive Chen's moves. The final departure earns a visible forfeiture (leaving the spy life, the island's gravitational pull internalized), yet the emotional progression leans on poetic assertion ("felt the rocky island slide inside him") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest's interior life is rendered through rich, specific imagery—trading his final sunrise for the ultraviolet palette, becoming "a living axle in the mechanism of doubt." His motivation to starve the demon of certainty through ambiguity drives concrete choices (capturing syllables, reversing them, painting silence). However, the piece operates at such high metaphorical density that embodied emotion and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene are obscured; we get poetic states more than felt interiority under pressure. The final transformation into a statue feels more conceptual than earned through visible cost tied to prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is dense with metaphor but lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure; she climbs, scratches, and conducts without visible internal conflict or trade-offs that foreclose paths. "Chronologically homesick" remains a poetic label rather than a dramatized contradiction that shapes on-page decisions. Emotions are asserted through ornate imagery ("ache," "exhaustion") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final collapse reads as exhaustion arriving on schedule, not a choice or renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is declared but never dramatized through embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The elder Kael encounter attempts internal conflict through the "minotaur" metaphor, but the revelation feels delivered rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("sequence of choices that led him here") rather than character-particular, concrete thought. The final choice to smash the tablet lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—what does Kael lose or renounce on the page?

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is concrete and specific: the felt-wrapped silence, the numbness she can *feel* through vibrations. Her motivation—to convert numbness into livable pain—drives every choice from filing the needle to pressing her palm on the drumhead. The emotional arc from muffled shock to grief arriving "loud inside her silence" is embodied and earned. Minor slip: Temen remains thinly sketched, a facilitator rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's professional meticulousness translates into character-specific perceptual filtering (wind shear "to the third decimal"), and her motivation to preserve data integrity drives the lateral escape and underground recording. The choice to write backward-dated entries and release counter-evidence via pigeon shows agency under pressure with visible cost (staying underground until contradictions overflow). Minor weakness: the follower remains abstract, limiting relational pressure. Internal contradiction between solitary integrity and the need for a "lateral chain" creates authentic tension at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly textured with embodied perception ("feeling the pulse of something ancient and electric," rope's texture as memory). Internal conflict operates through contradictory impulses—the pull toward transcendence versus attachment to physical form—but the peak choice to walk away feels more like atmospheric drift than a decision earned by prior causality. The rope functions well as an anchor for embodied thought, though Marcus remains a setup device rather than a pressure source. Reflection is extensive but anchored to concrete objects (rope, clay walls, tomatoes) and tilts present stance through micro-choices like picking up the rope and beginning to write.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and acoustically filtered ("minor seventh begging resolution"), with embodied emotion in her planting the seed and ritual acts. The grandmother's backstory anchors Mara's present renunciation of bonfire tradition with visible cost—she walks away from the crowd-based model. Internal contradiction appears in the decision to plant a seed in a mendicant's bowl (foolish vs. traditional), and the final choice to leave the bowl humming shows agency that forecloses collection-based survival. Minor slip: the grandmother's voice and Mara's own sometimes converge in elevated register during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's interior is vivid and embodied through concrete sensory detail—"pulse lied often and well," the static pull between coats. Her transformation is earned through the physical experience of the petal, layering grief, rage, and wonder without therapy-speak. The final choice to stay and let it hurt demonstrates contradictory impulses (detachment vs. connection) with visible cost. Minor: the chemist remains functional rather than fully realized, and some clients' emotions are summarized rather than dramatized in Lira's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's waiving of demurrage fees and her view of "compassion, like tide, must return" establishes interiority, though key motivations remain asserted rather than tested under pressure. The locket photo and her mother's legacy provide backstory depth, but the final act—pressing the photo into Beto's hand—feels more symbolic than a choice forged by internal contradiction. Beto's recognition of the mother adds coincidence that enriches texture but doesn't sharpen conflict. Minor embodiment gaps: "cautious exuberance" is named rather than shown through micro-choices in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interior journey from isolation to connection is clearly motivated and her final choice to "add another heron" demonstrates agency. However, her transformation feels somewhat telescoped—the "boldly sympathetic ache" is told more than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The twins function primarily as facilitators rather than sources of genuine relational friction, and the climactic moment where she "understood the webs of kinship were not inherited but forged" reads as epiphany-by-declaration rather than earned through grinding micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to find "the place where echoes are born" and recover her mother's final syllable is clear and specific. The cadence-breathing and pendant mechanics provide concrete action choices. However, the journey feels more lyrical than psychologically embodied—internal conflict is present but often abstracted through metaphor rather than visceral contradiction. The final turn (touching the echo, completing the cadence) arrives smoothly but lacks the micro-hesitation or cost friction that would raise it above competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conjurer's internal life is richly rendered through embodied perception—pressing glass eyes against stone, reciting primes, feeling weight resolve into warmth. The master's disappearance and the protagonist's grief-driven quest create clear motivation, though the final act (planting seedlings in the astrolabe, sealing them) feels more symbolic than a choice with visible stakes. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections") where concrete contradiction would sharpen pressure. The ending gesture of walking forward "gently inventive" is thematically coherent but lacks a foreclosed path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through methodical action (mapping joists, caching fragments) and specific interiority (sense memories triggered by fragments). The motivation to become visible through preserved voices shows internal consistency, though the shift from solitary dweller to collaborative curator feels somewhat telescoped. The girl functions less as a full character than as the recipient who validates Elias's three-year project. Embodied emotion is present in key moments ("made him weep," "closed his eyes") but the interior experience relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's transformation is tracked through embodied sensory detail (silver veins syncing with pulse, skin splitting along scars), and her fifteen-year scientific approach creates a clear through-line of control-seeking. However, the final metamorphosis feels abstract rather than earned by specific micro-choices; she "releases her grip on understanding" as a stated realization rather than through a sequence of concrete renunciations under pressure. The assistant and customers in the coda are underdeveloped, functioning more as thematic echo than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's insomnia and artistic struggle are established, but her interior life remains surface-level—she catalogs defeat, handles the brooch, paints, then sleeps, without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The exchange with the old woman generates recognition rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the final sleep feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse: "haggard awe" and "wryly earnest" are claimed more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from insomnia as burden to gift is asserted in summary rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pilgrim remains largely opaque—his motivation to carry everyday magic is told rather than enacted through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The clairvoyant's transfer and her subsequent loss of foresight provide a credible cost, but her interior life is thin; we witness her stagger and resign without embodied contradiction. The final image of him humming to children offers a gentle endurance, yet the path from cave to park lacks on-page friction that would reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority often abstracts into poetic summary rather than concrete, character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and embodied through specific perceptual filters (salt crust, pitted brass, pooling ink). The archivist's motivation to compile fragments is clear, though the final choice to blow the trumpet feels arrived-at rather than wrestled-with—no contradictory impulse pulls against the mission. The janitor and woman are functionally present but apply pressure through information-delivery more than relational friction. The transformation from exile to herald lacks visible internal cost; the narrator moves smoothly from bitterness to purpose without dramatized hesitation at the pier's end.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alden's internal contradictions are present—precision vs. painting, mapping routes nobody rides to avoid hearing his own heart—and embodied through his obsessive redrawing. The confession sequence ("I left because I was afraid of color") dramatizes internal conflict under pressure. However, the pivot from analytic mapper to confessing artist feels rushed; the middle段 leans heavily on symbolic narration rather than micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic mind") without always grounding emotion in specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is richly textured with contradictory impulses—she traces seams "she refused to believe were magic" yet chooses to transcribe the tile, and her skepticism battles genuine wonder in the climactic moment when she "chose to listen instead of refute." The embodied emotion is strong (knocking over the telescope, breath steadying, laughter at the end), and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the epiphany that she came "to sculpt space for reflection on her late mother's notebooks" arrives late without clear dramatization of that grief as a live wound shaping earlier choices, and the final transformation—from academic duty to participation—feels slightly under-earned given the speed of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vey's boredom and pursuit of "goodbye" provide motivation, and the choice to pass through the door is earned by the compulsion-transfer setup. However, interiority remains abstract ("iron boredom in his blood," "centuries cracking like ice") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The technicians appear only to facilitate plot rather than apply secondary pressure, and Vey's internal conflict is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassidy's motivation is concrete and contradictory—trading her last honest memory for her mother's redemption while inverting her father's legacy. Her micro-choices under pressure (dipping the nib, blowing on the ink, folding the document) are specific and reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict manifests in the active wait and the felt cost of losing the lullaby. Minor slip: Rurik's interior state ("trembling, as though waking from anesthesia") briefly leans toward diagnostic summary rather than pure embodiment, but the piece recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelia's motivation to collect textures of different times is clear and drives her to the mountaintop, but her interior life remains largely abstract—we see her earnest studiousness claimed rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The moment when she realizes the labyrinth is reading her inventories offers a turn, but her continued writing despite fear reads as declaration rather than a dramatized struggle between caution and compulsion. The final choice to launch the paper glider feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices with visible cost. Emotional progression is poetic but lacks the messy irrationality that would ground her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to prove her reality through collected voices is clear and drives her actions, but her interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The death certificate creates a strong initial stake, yet her emotional responses often read as performed metaphor ("felt the texture of memories rise beneath her skin like braille") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to feed the certificate to the tide and stamp the container shows agency, though the progression feels more accumulative than driven by internal conflict forcing incompatible wants into collision.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's interiority is vivid and contradictory ("gloomy cheerfulness"), and his actions are motivated by a clear obsession. However, the final choice—pocketing the compass and walking away—lacks visible cost; he leaves "carrying no proof except the memory of voices retold until they forgave him," which reads as an internal epiphany rather than a forfeiture that alters tactics. The cello completion and compass internalization feel like acquisitions rather than renunciations. Embodied emotion is strong throughout ("fishhook" tug, "sob," "carnival whistle"), but the ending doesn't foreclose a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lina's interiority is concrete and specific ("fingertips pressed to a foundation stone chip," "dual allegiance prickled"), with embodied contradictions driving her choices throughout. Her motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, from translating chaos to orchestrating overnight reorganization. The assembly's collective decision feels slightly underearned given the limited on-page deliberation, and some secondary characters (fire-eater, baker) remain gestural. The final choice to "invent tomorrow's graffiti" carries visible cost—postponement rather than resolution—earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inspector's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"curiosity was just another form of mourning" embodies the stance without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (stealing the grain, burying the smaller half, timing the shots) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The grandmother's camera and the hourglass theft layer contradiction: she preserves what no one else values yet knows her contract expires at sunrise. Internal conflict between witnessing and futility drives the final shutter clicks with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's blind artisan identity is embodied through concrete sensory substitution (water-refracted spectra, thrum of dying engine, boiler metronome) and her motivation to "decode feedback into direction" drives micro-choices under pressure. The drone's jitter → terror translation and her teaching it to read chaos feels earned, though the final choice lacks visible internal contradiction—her calm is magnetic throughout without meaningful friction. Col remains functional but flat, applying pressure only as a timekeeper and spectrum-reader. The ending renunciation (opening the bay door) forecloses further repair work but the cost feels muted because success was never in doubt once she diagnosed the feedback loop.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's interiority is selective and specific ("editor's instinct to annotate," the dry-witted register), and her descent is motivated by cumulative Registry frustration plus the phrasebook's childhood question. The protagonist's final choice—tearing the page and refusing coordinates—carries visible cost (defiance of employer, loss of proof). Minor slip: the falcon's role as pressure source feels more ornamental than urgent; Maren's decision to descend lacks a legible on-page struggle or trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation (restoring shared balance) is clear and his final sacrifice—shattering the fork and becoming transparent—carries visible cost. However, his interiority remains abstract and declarative; we're told he's "infinitely patient" and that he "broke it to save a child," but these traits function as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The choice to sacrifice himself feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses. The protagonist reads more as archetype than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied—guilt, survival instinct, and need to preserve memory drive concrete choices (prying open the console, uncorking the vial). Internal contradiction appears in "overriding her own instinct to flee" and the tension between escape and recording. However, several emotional beats rely on elevated summary ("lonesome splendor," "her motivation sharpened") that drifts toward abstraction rather than staying grounded in physical sensation. The final choice to leave the vial is earned by prior causality, and the cost (surrendering her last anchor to home) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    Cassian's motivation—threading a labyrinth with his father's story—is declared but never dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The father's appearance is neither ghost nor man, a convenient hedge that avoids committing to stakes. Interior texture relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("hush darted ahead, a silver minnow") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to descend the impossible staircase lacks visible cost; the "heartbeat he could finally trust" reads as unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost bride's motivations are clear but remain largely static; her seven-night escalation reads as iterative rather than internally conflicted. The boy's arc from fear to "mournful elation" lacks intermediate micro-choices that would ground the shift in contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation") rather than embodied sensation under pressure. The final forgiveness arrives without visible internal cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Calyx's motivation is legible—he is driven by the canyon's call and a desire to "sew back open" broken precedents—but his interior remains abstract. The piece tells us he "understood" and "surrendered" without embodying contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Key turns (pricking his palm, whispering the final line) are presented as ritual completions rather than decisions with visible cost or foreclosed options. Emotion is largely asserted through elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") rather than contradictory embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—restoring faith through rebuilding—is signaled early and drives her actions (kneeling at the skull, setting the sundial, teaching the hymn). However, interiority remains largely opaque; we see her act but rarely glimpse contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The caretaker boy is functional but his arc (from suspicious to laughing participant) lacks texture. The final choice to stay feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's core motivation—choosing between authentic disclosure and protective anonymity—is coherent and embodied through the physical acts of kneeling, writing, and deciding. However, her interior life leans heavily on abstraction ("meaning in the margins," "deception," "mask") without grounding these states in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice at closure (mailing the unsigned letter, keeping the confession) registers as thematically legible but feels more like a conceptual proposition than an earned struggle between competing goods with visible cost. The reflective density (~40% by rough count) anchors to present stimuli (the drone, the slot, the chalk) and primes the final choice, satisfying the BRR exception; no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The embroiderer's core motivation (listening for unheard stories) and method (disguising wisdom as foolishness) are asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her decision-making at the climax—spreading the cloth, speaking softly—feels smoothly competent without internal contradiction or visible struggle that would foreclose a path. The lieutenant's trembling hand offers a micro turn, but the embroiderer herself never wavers or pays a personal cost; her renunciation or alteration is not legible on the page. Interiority remains at a remove, with stock gestures ("she did not flinch") replacing embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to apologize to the brother is present and drives the journey, but interiority remains largely abstract and poetic rather than embodied. The medium makes no meaningful choices—she guides but does not face pressure or change. Emotional states are declared through metaphor ("pulse answered before I could") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final release of moths and the protagonist's walk home suggest change, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator-translator's motivation is clear and deepens through the scene, with embodied choices around the coral fragment and decryption. The morphine haze and "lotus-hearted ache" work as internal pressure but edge toward label-speak without full embodied contradiction. The child's shrewdly innocent quality is asserted more than shown in action; his whispered instruction and tapping gesture are the only dramatized beats. Interior voice is distinctive, though some phrasing ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") reads slightly therapeutic rather than crisis-urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Luma's motivation to recover lost joy anchors the piece, and her micro-choices (pocketing the fragment, whispering the pass-phrase, painting with pooled light) advance pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction—"joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust"—rather than embodied contradiction. The grandfather memory provides concrete emotional content, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more declared than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's core motivation (curiosity vs. certainty) is articulated but never genuinely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The nested-Liora sequence substitutes conceptual doubling for dramatized internal conflict. Her final choice to walk "the path that curved out of sight" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative—she simply continues her existing pattern of wondering. Embodiment is thin; emotions are largely declared ("frustrated," "felt the ground tilt") rather than shown through contradictory physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arlo's core motivation—protecting defiance against thought taxation—is stated early and drives his planting mission. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("converging chaos," "spark of defiance") rather than embodied contradiction; his charm is told ("charming rogue scholar's smile") more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The greenhouse confrontation with Voss offers a moment of tactical evasion, but the sequence lacks genuine internal conflict or visible struggle that would earn the closing defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zale's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction—"hollowing blade," "centuries of longing"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under present pressure. The boy-on-shore flashback (year 212) offers concrete detail, but the present-tense decisions feel more like fulfilling a predetermined ritual than wrestling with competing impulses. Motivation is declared ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than dramatized through conflicted action. The final descent reads as surrender to a pre-scripted role rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to preserve names is clear and her sacrifice structure tracks, but the piece leans heavily on labeled emotions ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied contradiction. The memory-for-name trade creates a mechanical progression without genuine internal conflict—she accepts each payment too smoothly. The final self-sacrifice reads as predetermined rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her particular psychology never emerges beyond the curator archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("carefully reckless," "cautious exuberance") and her actions follow a straight line without meaningful internal contradiction dramatized in scene. The dialogue with the archive's spirits introduces a genuine exchange, but her central choice—leaving the ink well—arrives without visible struggle over competing impulses. Emotions are asserted through metaphor ("heart exuberant yet measured") rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The piece never forces her to weigh incompatible goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mireya's core motivation is clear and her method of mediation drives the closure. However, the interiority remains thin—her contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized ("slyly heartfelt reverence" is label-only), and the emotional progression through discovery feels mechanical rather than embodied. The delegations' turn from "faces hard with seasons of mistrust" to nodding acceptance happens too cleanly without visible internal struggle. The final paragraph's reflective summary tells us about her steady hands and the founder's presence rather than showing cost in concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mirela's motivation to preserve lost songs is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The meteorite chip functions more as symbolic gesture than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Her final disappearance reads as summary rather than a dramatized renunciation, and the phrase "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" is a scaffold artifact that obscures rather than reveals her psychological progression. The pigeon Inkspot and Mr. Blackwood remain functional supports without applying meaningful relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Juniper's interiority leans heavily toward lyric abstraction ("inventing their own way home," "weather in wood") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation to understand thresholds is sustained but remains told more than dramatized through competing desires. The final "discovery" arrives as received wisdom from her father's voice rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in barefoot steps and chest-pressing gestures, but peak beats drift into metaphor rather than grounding her struggle in concrete physical or relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The astrologer's interiority is imagistic and consistent, but her micro-choices rarely show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghost encounter and ritual completion unfold as orchestrated moments rather than tension points where she must weigh competing goods. The final choice—boarding the submersible—feels inevitable rather than earned by prior struggle, with no visible cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is present but often abstract ("chest ache with shared exile") rather than particularized to this character under this pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's internal life is presented through vivid external transliteration (emotions into color, ground emotions into gold), but her decision-making remains largely observational until the mosaic arrangement. The core choice—to give the cliff "a new story, not an old route"—arrives as conjecture rather than a dramatized internal conflict with contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present (laughter in cheerful gloom, palms against the floor), yet the final vow feels asserted rather than earned by prior struggle with visible cost. Motivation is consistent but lacks the friction of competing desires that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cipher's interiority is richly textured—"ordering randomness, a discipline half math, half sleight-of-hand"—and his micro-choices (timing the approach, placing the bishop, retreating behind the booth) are consistent with his analytical street-performer identity. However, his motivation remains abstract throughout; "serenade monotony with creativity" is declared rather than embodied through conflicting desires under pressure. The final choice (pulling the slot machine and walking away) feels emblematic rather than a micro-choice revealing hierarchy of values with visible cost, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysira's motivation to create an indelible verse is clear and her body memory defying the ban provides internal contradiction. However, the interiority leans heavily on lyric assertion rather than micro-choices under pressure—she circles, dances, and speaks to moonstone dust without encountering meaningful resistance or cost until the verse appears. The final lines about "forever fledged" and walking toward the horizon read as declared transformation rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodiment is present in the dancing but the stakes feel more thematic than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is densely imagistic but lacks genuine contradiction—she moves through her ritual with steady conviction, no competing impulses acting simultaneously. The scar, teacup, and harmonica function as remembered objects rather than pressures that force difficult micro-choices in the present moment. Her final act (hurling the prism) feels motivated by her trade and private craft, but the decision carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she walks away smiling, conflict resolved too cleanly. Embodied emotion is present (pupils dilating, exhaling) but remains decorative rather than revealing contradictory states under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to translate pain is embodied through concrete actions—placing ash on tongue, drawing the spiral—but the internal experience leans heavily on poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory (ridge fire, girl's death) anchors present action and the final choice to visit the survivors' group forecloses isolation with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the mind's darker forest where every tree was a question") that risks distancing the reader from immediate embodied struggle, and the emotional progression feels more curated than credibly irrational.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is labeled a "logical dreamer" but her interiority consists largely of abstractions and metaphysical concepts rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The pricking of her finger and speaking the equation are concrete actions, but the stakes feel declared rather than viscerally tested—no genuine struggle or trade-off emerges on the page. The parallel-Miras concept remains ornamental; we never see contradictory versions forcing a choice. The final smile and walk into the tide read as serene closure without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's motivation is established through her professional role and ancestral connection, though the leap from cartographer to understanding she's pursuing her great-grandmother's exhalation feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices. Her final transformation into corridor-echo shows embodied consequence but the interiority remains more conceptual than contradictory—she moves toward the archive without visible internal resistance or competing impulse. The character arc tracks causally but lacks the friction of simultaneous contrary wants acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The mirage painter remains conceptually abstract throughout; her motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Interior life consists of generic contemplation ("eyes perceptively calm," "satisfied") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The heartbeat surrender feels unmotivated—no on-page struggle between keeping it and gifting it, just a smooth decision. The piece offers a symbolic figure executing a mission rather than a character wrestling with competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied—trembling hands, voice cracking under syllable weight—and his motivation (carrying twenty years of failed names) drives the ritual action. The piece maintains consistent character-particular perception filtered through a negotiator's lens. However, the final transformation ("not as a negotiator, but as a gardener of memory") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the protagonist's agency at closure is more symbolic witness than difficult choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philanthropist's interior contradictions drive the piece: he built the dam that created the drought but now seeks the extinct bird's echo as an atonement he won't admit. His micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the egg, swallowing the sound) are embodied and reveal a hierarchy of guilt, desire, and calculated sentiment. The "amoral philanthropist" framing risks being label-heavy, yet the tension between public laundering and private ritual is sustained through concrete action. The final beat—carrying the echo forward while planning "new dams tomorrow"—earns the stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lys is assigned contradictory impulses—chaste courtesan, rebel against conformity—but they remain abstract labels rather than acting simultaneously in scene. Her peak choice (stepping into the mirror, surrendering echoes) arrives without prior micro-decisions that dramatize the cost of liberation versus safety. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("her bodily poetic," "alarming serenity") rather than embodied sensation tied to immediate stakes. The contract-burning moment carries symbolic weight but no on-page hesitation or trade-off that would anchor her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lucien remains a vehicle for theme rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His "uncommonly serene" state is asserted repeatedly but never tested by genuine internal conflict—he moves smoothly from refusal to manifesto without friction. The puppeteer gift and grandmother memory are scaffolding backstory that provide convenient wisdom rather than complicating present choice. His final decision ("I will letter whatever words the world needs, but I will letter them with questions") arrives as epiphany rather than being earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories is established early and drives her actions through knotting wire and gathering stories. The interiority leans toward abstract poeticism ("the interrupted cadence of its flight become the rhythm of her work") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her grandmother's quoted wisdom feels like thematic scaffolding rather than a dramatized choice moment. The final emotional beat—crying from "loss or completion"—gestures at ambiguity but doesn't land a contradictory impulse acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's shift from guilt to agency is earned through concrete embodied progression: forgiveness arrives "quiet as hoarfrost forming," tears freeze into lenses, and the final repetition of names on the tongue demonstrates embodied stake. Interior states remain specific to the character's past as bell-caster and organ-smasher. Interiority occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("technically gentle wish") but the core arc—preservation as "continuing vibration passed from one medium to the next"—feels motivated and contradictory impulses (smashing vs. preserving) act in scene. The final choice to carry voices forward forecloses the path of silence with visible cost (heavier cargo, lighter guilt).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Foresight Hindsight Only remains abstract throughout; the "born without a future or a past" conceit is told but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her decision to lie on the lens and accept transformation lacks visible internal conflict—no stakes are tested, no path is foreclosed with felt cost. The final dissolution into weather and forest feels like passive surrender rather than earned agency. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is poetic assertion rather than character-particular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Naram-bel's motivation—to seal a covenant before the new regime—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (carrying the tile, entering the scriptorium, drawing schematics). His frugality is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction; the seven-year barley trade for the tile is told but not dramatized as a present trade-off. The sister's memory and "encrypted devotion" gesture toward internal depth, but remain label-only without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final oath and disappearance read as plot-driven rather than emerging from a visible inner struggle with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to release war-ghosts through cellular memory is clear and consistent, though her interior contradiction arrives late when the shadow-self appears. The soldier and girl lack distinct individual traits beyond their death moments; they function more as vessels than characters with conflicting impulses. The final acceptance of her own anger earns the closure choice, but the embodied emotion often slips into abstract phrasing ("calculus of vengeance solved itself into zero") rather than concrete sensation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mirror maker's interior life is grounded in craft-specific perception and embodied choices (pressing the sextant to her heart, slashing her palm). However, the emotional trajectory relies heavily on abstraction—"glass mountains of solitude," "aurora of childhood laughter"—rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted by the world rather than earned through internal contradiction; she follows a ritual her mother taught without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses a competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mender shows embodied emotion (pollen-freckled cheeks, cracked goggles) and her arc from breach to renewal is traced, but interiority remains abstract—phrases like "accidental wisdom" and "deciduous vows" function as thematic labels rather than lived contradictions. The daughter's late arrival and single question feel more like symbolic closure than a dramatized relationship under pressure. Micro-choices exist (grafting, whispering confession, barring elders) but the mender's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is heavily abstract and ornamental ("existential steam," "philosophical breakthrough") rather than embodied and contradictory. The protagonist drifts through metaphysical states without grounded micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—she experiences visions and realizations delivered to her rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final merging with the page reads as passive absorption rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Label-heavy interior monologue ("simply complicated truth," "nonlinear inheritance") replaces concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "steal back" unlearned lessons is declared but never internalized through embodied conflict or contradictory impulses. The time traveler remains a prop whose interiority is never dramatized; his "managed nod" and "gasping" are token gestures. The botanical diary's mechanics (ink-flowers opening to synonyms for regret, seeds falling through commas) function as magical solutions rather than choices that reveal character under pressure. The final choice—releasing absences into cities—carries no visible cost or forfeiture that closes a path; it reads as thematic assertion rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chimera twin character is defined primarily through ornamental metaphor rather than embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction exists (the "argument" of each stride, the sister's presence beneath skin) but remains abstract decoration rather than driving micro-decisions that narrow options. The final moment—breathing for two on the sinking carousel—gestures toward acceptance but arrives through accumulative description rather than a dramatized turn that costs something visible. Motivation remains opaque: we're told she seeks a name but the stakes of finding or losing it never materialize in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's archivist identity is established through concrete actions—reading "what wasn't there," cataloging absences, braiding the rope into village structures—and her "warmly methodical" trait shows in her composed archive-filing thought at the end. Internal experience remains consistent: curious, task-focused, satisfied at closure. However, no meaningful internal conflict appears; she encounters zero genuine obstacles or contradictions, proceeding smoothly from discovery to execution without struggle or cost to her personally. The "adaptable" trait is asserted but never tested; she adapts to nothing because nothing resists her.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (reading ice, wrapping the stone, completing the circle), though her internal contradiction remains largely implicit. Jalen exists primarily to receive instruction and mirror the keeper's stakes without applying independent pressure. The final act of releasing the stone's stored voices feels somewhat declared rather than earned through prior struggle with a clear personal cost—the keeper's renunciation of the maps is present but the emotional weight of losing her life's work could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The custodian's interior motivation is established early (proving coincidences have meaning, following her mother's path), and the retrocognitive ability provides texture. However, the protagonist's agency unfolds primarily through a quest structure rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The decision to track the shard and rekindle the lamp feels more like fulfilling a predetermined pattern than wrestling with competing desires. The final stance—becoming "the new prism"—arrives as epiphany rather than a choice forged from internal conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's interiority is densely rendered and her central contradiction—borrowed versus authentic self—drives the piece. However, the choice at closure feels more conceptual than viscerally embodied; the snapping of the quill and arranging pellets read as symbolic gestures rather than high-cost decisions that foreclose a live path with felt consequences. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait remains largely a label; it colors perception but doesn't visibly constrain an on-page action with immediate trade-off. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tears blurred her field notes—she could no longer tell which sorrow was hers").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Luma's motivation is clearly established (defying hopelessness), but her interior life remains largely abstract—we see her actions (chanting, trading, blowing dust) without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The governor's reversal from enforcing despair to consenting to the demonstration feels unmotivated; no prior causality explains why curiosity would override his stated policy. The silver dust that neutralizes the sentry and the mosaic note functioning as both literal object and symbolic heart collapse into convenient magic without earned constraints or visible cost to Luma's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is selective and embodied—studying moonlight on stone, feeling the jade cicada's pulse—but key motivations remain abstract. The reconciliation desire is told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The daughter's arrival and silent gestures show embodied emotion, yet her internal contradiction is minimal; she functions primarily as recipient of the chronicler's observational wisdom. The final choice to restart conversation feels inevitable but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "collect the flavors of different silences" drives her ascent with concrete micro-choices (limiting exposure, trading memories, releasing stored silences). Her claustrophobia is embodied through "contracted walls of her lungs" and the final transformation feels earned—she descends with "lungs wide," no longer contained. However, interiority occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction ("intangibly tangible," "gilded hush") that reads more as texture than contradiction. The keeper trade and membrane passage show stakes, but the emotional progression leans heavily on metaphor rather than embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Nilo's interiority is concrete and character-particular—the brass dial grafted to his wrist, the storm glass rituals, the cultivation of silence as both craft and philosophy. His micro-choices (loosening the clamp, easing the throttle, monitoring decibels) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in his mother's teaching. The commuter's confession is earned by the vial's emptying and Nilo's example, and his emotional arc (fear spoken aloud, lightened exit) shows embodied progression. Minor weakness: the commuter's pulse-driven decibel jump feels slightly mechanical rather than fully embodied, and Nilo's final solitude risks tilting toward contemplative stasis without a sharp internal contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    The lore keeper remains abstract throughout—her interiority consists of generic "feeling history" and "accepting responsibility" rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The grandmother's deathbed whisper and decades of mapping are told backstory that never forces an on-page micro-choice with visible cost. The final "smile at the beautiful absurdity" is an asserted epiphany rather than an earned shift, and the protagonist's stance never meaningfully changes from beginning to end. Motivation is declared ("maintaining true history") but never dramatized through a choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shadow keeper's motivations are established through embodied detail (practicing breath-holding, scars traced), and the boy's suffocation under parental expectations is specific. However, the protagonist's arc feels more like a repeated ritual than an evolving choice—she performs the same role without internal contradiction or stakes that test her. The final "gift" of the boy's first breath arrives without visible cost to her stance or methods, making the change feel conferred rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's goal to crystallize pressure into restitution is clear and her arc from survivor to liberation is earned through on-page action. However, interiority trends toward abstract ("promises could photosynthesize into debt," "she could pick their locks") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The parallel-Liras device creates conceptual interest but dilutes direct emotional stakes; Lira's final choice to throw the diamond feels more symbolic than causally motivated by visible internal conflict. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is labeled but rarely shown constraining a live choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arin's motive to uncover ancestral crimes is clear and drives the central action, but interiority relies heavily on decorative metaphor ("carved purpose into marrow") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decisive act—playing the recording and speaking it aloud—feels symbolically inevitable but emotionally thin; we see resolve without genuine internal friction or cost that forecloses a live path. Muse's presence adds texture but functions more as atmospheric pressure than a second character applying relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight's transformation exhibits embodied progression through concrete choices (unsnapping the clasp, nodding assent), and the final wooden state carries visible cost. However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("shapes of possibility," "shivering bliss") that distance the reader from immediate sensation. The motivational chain—oath to jester-king driving the exchange—reads as adequately causal but the psychological particulars of why he accepts this prison remain thinly sketched. Internal contradiction is present (shame versus duty) but not enacted in micro-choices that test commitment before the final surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rowan's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"her heart stuttered," the button "centered beneath the gooseneck lamp," palm catching snow. The backward pull to her nine-year-old self and her great-uncle anchors motive in lived memory rather than exposition. The final renunciation (placing the button in Marcus's file, walking home lighter) feels earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the "tactfully hopeful" dust and "breathing" provenance edge toward therapeutic diction in a few beats, lowering from high-8.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve erased histories is established early and her resourcefulness drives key beats (using the key, threading the tape, wiring the tower). However, interiority remains largely abstract and label-driven ("carefully resourceful," "underestimated rebel") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice—standing with raised hands—feels more symbolic tableau than a decision that forecloses a path with visible internal cost. Emotional progression is asserted ("knowing that plans unravel so that better ones can knot") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    The saxophonist's interiority is established through embodied details (brass horn beaded with dew, throat raw) and his motivation to counter the prophecy is consistent. However, the character remains more vessel than agent—his micro-choices (altering fingering, whispering "Not yet") feel reactive rather than revealing hierarchies of value under pressure. The mother's whispered prophecy and childhood nostalgia provide backstory anchoring, but the protagonist's internal contradiction never sharpens into competing impulses that act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "play it back into silence" reads as continuation rather than a costly foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mireya's motivation crystallizes clearly ("she would build tiny monuments"), but the transformation claimed in "felt herself emerge transformed always" is asserted rather than demonstrated through embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The phrase "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds" at the climax reads as label-speak rather than specific interiority. Supporting sorters appear but apply no relational pressure; their contribution feels ornamental. The ending choice (releasing the moonstone) lacks visible cost—no foreclosed path or trade-off appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's central choice—to leave the artifacts and embrace uncertainty—arrives on the page with visible renunciation, and the embodied chill and mercury-ladder metaphor show physical cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("ashes of routine," "ashes of certainties") rather than concrete contradiction, and the jump from tinkerer to phantom admiral occurs entirely off-page across "years later," diluting the causal link between the cellar decision and the final stance. The motivational through-line is present but relies on lyric assertion more than dramatized internal conflict during the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aurelia's motives—grief, guilt, alchemical redemption—are clear, but interiority operates at high register throughout without degradation under stress. The twin's death and the coin-mending ritual show embodied stakes, yet micro-choices feel pre-determined rather than pressured; she never hesitates or contradicts herself in scene. Emotional texture leans toward label-speak ("luminous regret," "factually mystical") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final turn—joining the search to teach others—arrives as epiphany without visible internal cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (collecting laughter splinters) is poetic but remains abstract; her interior life consists largely of metaphorical statements rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "modestly fearless" trait is label-only and never constrains a choice. The child-giggle is a spectral object rather than a second character, so relationship dynamics don't apply. The final act—pressing the tooth to the harp—feels more like ritual completion than a choice with visible cost or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is highly specific and embodied through proprioceptive detail ("twig's snap echoed inside my joints") and the physicalized equation-seeking creates a distinct consciousness under pressure. Motivation to find "the mathematics of mercy" drives concrete actions—bracing, walking deeper, removing the strap—each a micro-choice that advances the arc. The final renunciation (leaving the strap, walking out) forecloses a return with felt cost. However, the trauma-response mechanism remains abstract; we never see the narrator make a choice complicated by competing impulses in a single beat, only a steady march toward the same goal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's role as translator is established early with concrete interior stakes (the fragment "warm as skin," the mother's lullaby), and the time-loop encounter with boy-self shows embodied decision-making. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("intuition is not a compass but a tide") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to return the fragment feels thematically motivated but arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that would foreclose a live path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is richly embodied through contradictory impulses—fixing what climbs while seeing what falls—and her embodied perception (feeling the building's pulse, analyzing dust patterns) is character-specific. The moment she examines the crack in time and sees herself in a loop demonstrates genuine internal conflict dramatized in scene. The final choice to leave the mainspring barrel and accept the ticket is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: she forsakes the repair trade's certainty for ascending into the unknown. Minor slip: the ghost child's symbolic function occasionally edges into convenient guidance rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Corwin's motivation—compress eternity to fill his "cracked chase"—is declared but never embodied in a micro-choice that weighs competing goods. His interior is heavily decorated with metaphor ("heart was a cracked chase; letters kept falling out of order") yet he never hesitates, second-guesses, or pays a visible emotional price when he uncorks the whisper. The mirror-keeper dissolves into shards without dramatized reaction from Corwin, leaving no stance crystallization or relationship crucible on the page. Interiority remains ornamental rather than contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelia's motivation is clear—revolutionary failure drives her to reimagine a civilization through poetic acts—but her internal contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatically acted. The dissolution ending bypasses the cost of a final choice; she becomes "burnished sorrow" rather than making a renunciation that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present ("staggered," kneeling, crushing the shard) but the peak beat leans on abstract poeticism ("dissolved into the burnished sorrow") instead of concrete consequence. The archaeologist's sudden conversion lacks sufficient on-page friction to earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are clear—repairing the orrery to restore light for his daughter—and the confession to the rust ("I came not to save the city first, but to reclaim the light...") embodies internal conflict. However, his interiority leans toward elevated exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; phrases like "mending what isn't torn, he whispered, feeling the paradox" tell the reader his state rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to complete the lullaby lands with emotional weight, but the path there feels more like fulfilling a predetermined arc than wrestling with competing goods in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ivy's defining motivation (seeking where explanations fail) drives her descent and the psychometry reading, and the brass-compass fever-warmth signals her gift concretely. Internal contradiction appears when terror arrives but "politeness excused it"—a moment that feels ornamental rather than dramatized struggle. The final transformation (compass dissolving into her ribcage as a second heart) lacks visible cost; she steps back "no longer collector or delver but hinge herself" without forfeiting a tangible option or enduring friction. Embodiment is present (knees buckling, fingers pressed to stone) but the peak choice—releasing the vials—reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a lived path.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maela's choices drive key beats—pulling the slide from her pocket, wedging it into driftwood, carving with storm guidance—but her interior voice tilts abstract ("perpetually learning the grammar of currents") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to leave GPS drowned feels more symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with visible cost on the page. Micro-choices exist but lack friction between competing impulses; she moves through the storm without genuine missteps or self-deception that would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interiority is present but abstract—"quietly driven need," "hush inside herself"—without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Her final understanding feels delivered rather than earned through visible on-page struggle. The grief melting and the epiphany about darkness are told in summary mode with poetic metaphor substituting for micro-choices under pressure. No secondary character appears to test her stance; the piece remains a solitary meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mireya's motivation is clear and body-bound ("throat full of salt," boots sinking), though the peak choice—broadcasting the diary—arrives quickly after discovery with limited dramatized internal conflict between preservation instinct and exposure risk. The embodied grief and professional identity coheres well. Minor slip: the moment of deciding to broadcast lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from kneeling to action without visible hesitation or cost-weighing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist exhibits clear motivation and makes concrete choices (twisting lantern frames, burning them, burying the bottle), with embodied contradiction between the wish for "integrity of endings" and the impulse to resurrect Cove. However, interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("working memory is a retort") rather than lived contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of the bottle and commitment to kinetic ritual feels earned, but the middle section's reflective density flattens the sense of immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ambrose's interiority shows embodied specificity (kneeling, tweezers, ledger work) and his core contradiction—archivist versus suppressor—operates on the page. The child-memory and the prophecy's cruelty are motivated by established backstory (born speaking dead languages, 1958 field trip). However, the final stance feels preordained rather than wrestled from live friction; he simply "waits" for the knock without a visible micro-choice that forecloses another path. The closure cost is conceptual but not dramatized as a decision with visible alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's stance is consistent—seed guardian driven by heritage—and embodied details anchor her choices (breath into the cap, cracking it to share the spiral). However, interiority leans abstract ("collective memory murmur," "furiously tranquil promise") and misses concrete contradiction or struggle; the cap's solution arrives without visible hesitation or cost that tests competing impulses. The final walk feels more like thematic coda than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"chilled fingers," "heart drumming louder than the bronze"—and her choice to ring the bell over the siren is earned by prior causality (the rope's tug, her father's legacy, her vow to listen). The internal contradiction between civic duty and mountain courtesy drives the peak decision with visible cost: she risks her station's protocol to answer the mountain's whisper. Minor weakness: the father's pine-tar soap memory edges toward sentimental scaffolding without materially altering her present choice, and "credibly curious" reads as a label rather than dramatized trait in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The janitor's journey from grief to reopened vulnerability is conceptually present, but the transformation relies heavily on labeled emotion ("grief he carried," "strength in vulnerability") rather than embodied contradiction. The vision sequence provides a catalyst, yet the protagonist remains largely receptive rather than making conflicted choices under pressure. The meteor's question about bravery is delivered as wisdom rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the final trade—lantern for "reopened chest"—is asserted more than shown through micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alden's motivation to preserve unspoken words is established early and drives his ritual, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("weight... more than stone," "pressure equal to the desert's heat") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to speak and seal the fracture shows agency with cost, but the decision feels more thematic declaration than earned struggle between contradictory impulses. The child ghost and head beekeeper remain atmospheric presences rather than sources of relational pressure. Micro-choices accumulate toward the ending, meeting baseline expectation but not exceeding it.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The timekeeper's motivation to understand texture over measurement is clear and embodied through concrete actions (rubbing the urn shard, climbing the silo, reading tags). Interior life shows genuine curiosity rather than stock sentiment. The final exchange where he trades the fragment "felt the texture shift inside his ribs" demonstrates embodied emotion. However, the character's choices feel more observational than decisional—he descends, reads, asks, offers—without meaningful internal conflict or a foreclosed path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's interior is present through embodied attention ("warmly attentive"), but his choices lack meaningful conflict or cost. The woman arrives as a second character, but her role amounts to accompaniment rather than pressure. The final gesture—placing the feather, walking the spiral outward—reads as enacted symbolism rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The piece offers meditative observation but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through physical choices (wire wrapping, grafting, altar-sleeping). Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between her systematic nature and the deadline's mysticism, though her flawless execution under terminal illness strains credibility. The fox and bats function more as symbolic witnesses than pressuring characters; Mara's solitary agency drives all choices. Minor deduction for competence without visible struggle: her hands shake once but the wire "steadies them," softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation—proving return is chemical reaction—is clear and consistent, and her final action (planting the empty amber) carries cost in that it abandons pursuit without resolution. Interiority is often concrete ("scent of stove gas, creak of a stair she never noticed she noticed"), but the vision sequence relies on abstract constructions ("not as it was, but as her body remembered it") that soften embodied stakes. The "luminous skeptic" label recurs without complication, and no contradictory impulse tests her hypothesis mid-climb; she observes more than she struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's motivation is established—using dead languages and seeds to fertilize a battlefield—but his interior life remains thin; he functions more as a vessel for poetic action than a character with contradictory impulses. The "dead languages hummed inside his ribs like bees" is vivid, yet we never see him struggle with doubt or cost during the ritual itself. The final choice to carry "only seeds, only stories" feels declared rather than earned through on-page friction. Embodied emotion is present in "voice cracking" and "living tongue bled," but these moments arrive late and don't build from earlier micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Scraps shows embodied agency in her intuitive tracking and the decisive bark that prompts Kite's action, but much interiority is metaphorically filtered ("the intuitive descriptive tug") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Kite's brother remains off-page, leaving the relationship crucible underdeveloped. The final renunciation—Scraps setting the leaf on the threshold—reads as earned by prior tracking yet lacks visible internal cost or contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's grief and survivor's guilt are embodied through concrete gestures (palm to frost-rimmed window, gilded compass rose). The final choice to take Mother's hand feels emotionally earned, though the motivation shifts from sketching ritual to accepting an impossible reunion without sufficient on-page conflict between wanting to stay and wanting to follow. Internal contradiction is present (guilt vs. longing) but the decisive moment arrives without visible cost—he simply accepts the corridor. The renunciation of the station/reality needed one micro-choice that acknowledged what he was leaving behind.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vespers operates with consistent agency and her choice to pass the sundial lid to the child closes a legible arc of apprenticeship, though the lyric register keeps interiority at arm's length—we observe stylized gestures rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Halcyon's fear of heights arrives as a carved secret rather than dramatized resistance, weakening his presence as a pressure point. The protagonist's motive ("steal only what people no longer dare to keep") is declared rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final handoff feels ceremonial rather than costing Vespers a visible path or capability. Embodied emotion is sparse; poetic imagery substitutes for moment-to-moment internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's progression from crisis actor to nomadic archivist demonstrates motivated interiority, though her choices often feel choreographed rather than earned through visible internal conflict. The relationship with Kestrel arrives late and resolves too smoothly—his immediate transformation from potential threat to co-conspirator bypasses the friction needed to charge their alliance. The final gesture of wrapping the chessboard lacks the visible cost that would make her renunciation feel weighty rather than symbolic. Embodied emotion is present but frequently abstracted through elevated metaphor rather than visceral particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mercury-glass seer's interiority is vivid and embodied through concrete sensory details (feather texture, mirror-scrying). Her internal conflict between guilt over past prophecies and need to reclaim talents shows contradictory impulses, though the motivation for refusing to replant gifts feels somewhat asserted rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The custodian's shadow-stretching and spectacle-wearing details are striking but he remains functional opposition rather than a fully pressured second character. The final renunciation carries visible cost (sealing talents forever, becoming "no oracle") but the turn happens swiftly without prolonged internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek's interior landscape is specific and contradictory—he searches for forgiveness through geometry yet understands partway through that solving is not the path. The chess-tutor guilt is embodied through his habit of translating "silence into strategy" and his tournament calm returning under pressure. The phantom-king sequence and final gesture of righting the fallen piece earn his shift without therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the duke's daughter remains abstract; her trembling hands are told rather than shown in a live beat, and Marek's realization that he can meet her "without the old choke of guilt" edges toward summary rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking to scatter blame through the canyon's refractive properties—but her interior contradictions lack simultaneous pressure; they alternate rather than collide in scene. The final choice (accepting the cost, tucking the feather, leaving) feels structurally earned but emotionally thin; we see the gesture more than the felt renunciation. Embodied emotion appears in flashes ("laughed, a sound bright enough to wound") but key beats lean on metaphor-heavy narration rather than contradiction acting in the body. The queen remains a shadow; no secondary character applies live pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is clear and her final choice—pressing the charm to the porthole despite the risk—shows agency with visible cost. However, her interior voice carries elevated diagnostic phrasing ("uncertain alchemist's hands," "quilts memories together into a sigil") that reads as imposed rather than felt under pressure. The embodied contradiction is present (terror versus salvation impulse) but the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("meaning, a reason," "grief") rather than concrete sensory particulars during the peak beats. The workshop's sinking forecloses her life with legible cost, meeting the closure threshold for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—the salt taste as memory, the intimately aloof stance that shifts at the shell discovery. The protagonist's micro-choices (packing oils, entering the cleft, copying the vision, wedging the shell) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—boarding with empty hands after selling the mirror—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of preservation through conventional means. Minor slip: "intimately aloof" is used twice as a label without full dramatization of the contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The assistant lighthouse keeper's motivation is established (proving whispers travel farther), but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract claims ("screaming tenderness," "purifies intentions") rather than embodied contradictions. The mother's drowning and the protagonist's isolation are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final beckoning gesture and the boat's response feel more symbolic than causally earned by prior struggle, and the therapeutic language ("vibrations of intent travel farther than any voice") flattens what could be urgent grief into a concept.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The navigator's interior life relies heavily on poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her choice to step into the spiral feels inevitable given the lyric momentum, but we lack concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost—she moves through the ritual without meaningful hesitation or competing impulse. The stitched-together body is vivid metaphor but remains label-level; we don't see her bodily experience degrade or her perception narrow under theStation's transformation. Motivation is told through extended metaphor ("grief had emptied") rather than dramatized through a present stakes-test that forces her to weigh what she's sacrificing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal state is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (the truffle's scent forcing memory, the glass eye burning through wool). Emotional logic remains consistent—fear of silence drives choices throughout—and the final decision to "drink…not to erase, but to carry them more gently" is earned by the accumulating pressure of memories and the translucent congregation. Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward abstract phrasing ("cultivating psychological safety") that slightly distances us from the visceral experience, though this is largely mitigated by the concrete action framing it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is embodied through physical action (climbing stairs, pinning the flower, releasing it) and her lighthouse-keeper expertise grounds her perceptual signature. Her decision to break the cycle by releasing the Edelweiss is earned by the accumulating gaps and the logbook entry she didn't recognize writing. The "borrowed memories" concept creates genuine internal pressure—she must forfeit her own recollections to close the gaps—though the stranger himself remains a cipher whose collapse we never inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—dissatisfaction with inherited duty and the pull of his father's promise—but his internal struggle lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to step through feels more inevitable than earned through on-page cost; he "hesitates" but the passage offers little embodied friction between fear and desire. The "empirically intuitive" trait remains a label without shaping a visible choice or tradeoff. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("fear and possibility") at the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The queen's motivations are present but abstract—"mystery of recurring dreams" drives her, yet internal contradiction is minimal and micro-choices under pressure are largely absent. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("shared exhale between her present and future selves") rather than embodied emotion or concrete struggle. The final choice to step onto the dais and accept erasure arrives without visible wrestle between contradictory impulses acting in scene. Backstory floods the piece (dream prophecy, courtier behavior, mirror-blurring) without anchoring to present micro-decisions that tilt stance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corin's interiority shows contradiction—he's spent seven years pursuing false quantification of emotion, then recognizes the shell's spiral "suggested a mathematics beyond chemistry." His crushing of the pocket-sun is motivated by the shift from preservation to release. However, the epiphany feels compressed; the leap from "selling absence" to understanding "presence" arrives quickly without embodied struggle in the moment. Mira's "directed spontaneity" and her whispered secret to the shell show restraint, but her role remains reactive rather than forcing Corin's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia" bite, jealousy of past selves, the tension between chronicling and being chronicled by dreams. Embodied choices appear: kneeling in snow, feeding the stove, drawing the spiral. The final decision to leave the stone and turn inside forecloses rescue fantasies with quiet cost. Minor weakness: some emotional states ("jaded wonder rattling in her ribs") lean toward label-speak, but contradictory impulses (envy of corpse, bird, yesterday's self) remain active throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior life is rendered through concrete sensory absence ("hollow nose") and embodied choices (polishing the screw, tracing its thread). Her motivation to "refill with meaning if not molecules" drives the arc credibly. The final pocket-gesture is earned, though the move from loss to midwifery metaphor relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina's interior life is richly embodied—"heartbeat felt like a rune gone wrong," breath crystallizing into needles—and her motivation to rewrite grief through ritual is concrete and contradictory. The brother's death operates as a live constraint that shapes her present choices (timing the twelfth stroke, accepting terror as anchor). Master Jomei remains functional but thin, serving primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure. The final agency—speaking the brother's name into the storm—earns its weight through prior embodied struggle, though the shift from crystallized silence to flight feels slightly declarative in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The exorcist's motivation—guilt over banishing her sister—drives the arc with embodied interiority ("apology... clung to her tongue like rosin"). Internal contradiction surfaces in "I thought banishing your ghost would stop the pain," showing contradictory impulses. However, the final reconciliation arrives without visible renunciation or trade-off; the sister simply forgives, and the exorcist walks away having "released" the soul with minimal on-page cost to her present choices or future path. The ending feels more resolved than earned by a decision that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The witness remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of abstract meditation ("the cosmic illusion was not that things end, but that endings are separate from beginnings") without character-particular texture. The final "tipping" into self-puncture reads as metaphysical assertion rather than earned change rooted in prior causality. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist drifts through predetermined spiritual stations.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Torvald's interiority is heavily abstract and philosophical rather than embodied—he reflects on time's nature through elevated metaphysical claims ("clocks didn't measure hours but rather the distance between who we were and who we might become") without concrete micro-choices under pressure. The dream-of-daughter's-death beat offers a glimpse of genuine contradiction, but it arrives as exposition rather than dramatized friction. His final transformation into "the space between memory and possibility" reads as conceptual assertion rather than earned change with visible cost. Motivation remains declared rather than tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is coherent—she wants understanding without forgiving—but her interior voice trends toward elevated, label-like phrasing ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. The final choice to "bet on herself" is set up by the diary revelation, but the embodiment of that shift remains somewhat abstract; we see her leaving pages but not a visceral micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The father exists mostly in backstory and diary entries; his compulsive gambling is told rather than shown influencing present tactics, and Mira's "theoretically rebellious" attribute never visibly constrains an on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("cultivated estrangement the way gardeners cultivate orchids"). Internal contradiction operates through the tension between isolation and the child's voice becoming "the hour hand of my clock." The final choice—handing over the disc and stepping onto the track bed—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the cultivated loop with visible cost. Minor slip: the woman's sudden appearance and backstory ("I was the kid") compresses motivation that would benefit from one more anchoring beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and embodied—pulse syncing with waves, knees creaking, the locket's warmth against her wrist. Her final choice to steep the locket into the tube forecloses a visible path with felt cost ("lighter yet heavier"). Internal contradiction is present (preservation vs. letting go) and drives the climactic renunciation. The daughter remains largely off-page until the coda, limiting relationship pressure, but the archivist's micro-choices under duress are legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kit's motivation is clear (fleeing loneliness through reciprocity), and the moon-rock ritual embodies his need for transaction. The arrival of Lila and his choice to hand over the fragment provide visible agency, though his interior contradictions (believing/not believing rumors) remain largely asserted rather than acted in scene. The ending choice to board the train feels more symbolic than earned by prior causality—he leaves because "the timeframe had arrived," not because a prior choice foreclosed staying.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapmaker's interior journey is embodied through concrete sensory apparatus (ring, cane, skin-reading) and the final act of tracing feelings in soil earns his shift. However, the emotional catalog ("vertigo of almost loving," "ache of remembering a dream") reads more as poetic inventory than dramatized contradiction. The backstory paragraph (sight draining, unfinished map) anchors present stakes but the protagonist's agency operates mostly through reception rather than conflicted choice until the kneeling beat. Micro-choices that alter present tactics are sparse; he follows the trail without meaningful resistance or cost until arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation (threshing meaning) is consistent and embodied through the pen-wielding action. Interior life shows genuine contradiction—"confidently uncertain"—and the final choice to plant new seeds is earned by the anomaly's resolution. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("filaments," "contingent relationships") rather than concrete bodily struggle, and the climactic "unbending" moment lacks visceral cost; we're told she "felt relationships shift" rather than shown a foreclosed path. The renunciation of certainty reads more as theme statement than lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The advisor remains an abstract cipher throughout—no interior contradiction, no embodied micro-choices under pressure, only performative gestures described from outside. His "motivation, carried like a lantern beneath the ribs" is pure lyric assertion without any on-page conflict or cost that would make the choice to "translate silence into music" feel earned. The townspeople react but never become agents; they are passive receivers of the advisor's gift, and their tears of "joyful sorrow" arrive as emotional summary rather than dramatized consequence. "Quietly charismatic" is demonstrated through external reverence (dogs, drunks) but never tested or constrained by an on-page choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ember's motivation is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The "analytically intuitive mind" remains a label without on-page demonstration of how this trait constrains or enables choices under pressure. Interior life consists of abstract declarations ("understanding destruction's dual nature") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation from "broken arsonist" to "keeper of truth" is told, not earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's core motivation—to reclaim internal space from grafted memories—is legible and drives her movement from clinic to lagoon. The shift from "trying to externalize the overload" to accepting "teaching harmony" arrives suddenly without intermediate contradiction or embodied hesitation; the pivot feels declared rather than wrestled through visible micro-choices. Interiority relies heavily on figurative language ("moth wings," "contraband metronomes") that beautifies state but rarely grounds it in specific bodily sensation or irrational impulse under duress. The final stance—"conductor emeritus"—reads as a conceptual label rather than an earned identity forged by prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's characterization is anchored in concrete professional expertise (seven years mapping the labyrinth, trained ear identifying walks), but her motivations remain largely reactive—she responds to the stranger rather than pursuing a visible goal of her own. The stranger's walk is identified ("short strides, weight on the balls of the feet"), yet this attribute never constrains or enables an on-page choice with cost; it's label-only observation. Internal contradiction is minimal; Mira moves from wariness to collaboration without visible friction or trade-off, flattening the arc into smooth consensus.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's mute state is well-anchored in backstory (child drowning, scream submerged), and her final tears at seeing the child "floating safe inside a galaxy" deliver embodied emotion. However, the central choice—teaching darkness through light-weaving—lacks internal contradiction or genuine cost; she executes her ritual smoothly without visible struggle or renunciation. The protagonist reads more as a vessel for lyric atmosphere than a character tested by competing impulses. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("she felt its attention settle") rather than contradictory thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior life is rich with poetic perception ("heard unspoken words the way other people heard wind"), but her motivations remain abstract—why does she coach chess nobody asked for, and what personal stake drives tonight's rebellion? The gathered crowd (cashiers, janitors, Ellis) confess particulars that feel authentic, yet Mara's own contradictory impulses never dramatize in scene; she orchestrates without visible internal friction. The ending renunciation ("knowing the next match would not be played on sixty-four squares") carries thematic weight but lacks a foreclosed personal path or cost that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"heart tugged harder than gravity," the scrimshaw heating against her skin—and her final choice to release the carving carries visible cost. However, the motivational arc leans heavily on Brine Jack's abstracted legacy and the whale's call rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shift from guarded to open feels more declared than earned through on-page friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The performer's moral ambiguity is embodied through contradictory past actions (reporting neighbors, forging joy coupons) that complicate present stance. Her embodied whittling and narration show agency under the remade hush, though internal contradiction could press harder in the moment. The officer's shift from enforcer to co-whittler provides relational pressure, but his arc feels slightly under-motivated in the turn itself. Micro-choices accumulate toward the planting gesture, which carries visible cost in the form of renounced safety.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cloud-shadow poet exhibits a clear artistic motive and the text attempts interior contradiction ("certainty…tremor"), but interiority is abstract and label-driven ("aesthetically driven," "tremor of certainty") rather than embodied through competing impulses in scene. Her risk of re-freezing is stated but never forces a visible micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The "lantern-moth hush" and quartz-recognition beats provide atmospheric texture, yet no genuine struggle or flaw complicates her execution—she succeeds via poetic assertion without on-page cost that forecloses a lived option.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Milo's interiority is present and his choices shape the ending, but his motivation to see color feels abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Rosa's "innocently cunning" trait is labeled (line 14) rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The final renunciation—Milo never painting again—lands with conceptual weight but lacks on-page friction between competing wants at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The bell ringer's interior life remains abstract—labels like "coaxing music from metal" and "texture of connection" never ground in embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The collectors are functionally interchangeable, with no individual resistance or cost when they "dismantle their equipment." The protagonist's transformation from mourning to creation is asserted rather than earned through visible on-page struggle. "Powerfully gentle" appears as a descriptor but never constrains a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The jewelry maker's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her interior life consists largely of abstract reflection about grief and transformation without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the decade of solitude is told rather than shown to foreclose options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation to "reverse engineer culture" is established early and her actions consistently pursue this goal through concrete choices (measuring, mapping, footprints-as-data). Interior access shows specificity in her techniques and inherited responsibility, though the interiority sometimes drifts toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to seal the work and descend is earned but the emotional cost reads more conceptual than visceral—she leaves "steadily curious" rather than visibly altered. The crypto-crash backstory anchors motivation but remains summary; more present-scene friction would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; she moves through the archive in a dreamlike procession without internal contradiction or visceral struggle. Interiority consists largely of abstract assertions ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia") rather than embodied emotion. The final shift from lone historian to community teacher is narrated in summary across multiple paragraphs without a dramatized turning point that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve hope is clear and her final choice to internalize the stone carries cost, but her interiority often reads as poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "shadow unbound" functions more as atmospheric metaphor than as a credible internal force driving contradictory impulses in scene. Emotional progression is legible but lacks the messy irrationality—hypocrisy, self-deception—that would elevate this to high-band characterization. The mother exists only in projection and memory, not as an on-page pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miren's motivation is embodied through concrete action (removing ring, unpinning braid, burning lecture notes) that dramatizes internal conflict between her professional identity and raw accountability. The dual impulse—self-reckoning versus compassion—drives visible choices with contradictory weight. Minor slip: "the fraud she had unwittingly protected" edges toward diagnostic label-speak rather than staying fully embodied. The final release of Aster earns the stance shift, though the closing reflection ("poorer in pride and richer in doubt") tilts slightly toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and interiority is highly specific (the serum-plant telepathy, the scar wound as text), but the emotional progression feels too smooth given the stakes. The peak choice—reopening the wound—lacks sufficient contradiction or hesitation; the narrator moves through this pivotal self-harm with poetic distance rather than visceral ambivalence. The micro-choices are present but feel pre-determined by the lyric design rather than genuinely conflicted in the moment. Embodied emotion appears ("tasting iron and lilac") but is often abstracted by the elevated register ("cellulose thread, teaching me that scars are simply stories written sideways").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is heavily metaphoric but her goal—to find unused love crystallized in the theater—remains clear and drives the sequence. The grief motivation is established early (mother's vanishing, hummed lyrics, wax-sealed letters). Internal contradiction emerges when she realizes "love unused is not gone; it loops," which shifts her stance from retrieval to release. However, the final turn feels arrived-at rather than wrestled; the discovery of the cigarette case and complete letter reads convenient, and the climactic choice to scratch new lyrics lacks visible cost or foreclosed options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear—freeing trapped creativity—and interiority is concrete in key moments (the five-year-old self with glitter, teachers' scissors). However, the character moves through much of the story in a passive, oracular mode; she enacts a ritual rather than making high-stakes choices under pressure. The final dissolution reads more as surrender to a predetermined fate than as an earned renunciation that forecloses a live path. Internal contradiction is minimal; she never wavers or second-guesses the design.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard's motivation is consistent—cultivating sparks in unlit corners—and his actions align with that charge. However, interiority remains abstract: "dreamless" functions as a label rather than dramatized constraint, and emotional states are described through metaphor ("pulse steady") rather than embodied contradiction. The transition from performing a ritual to stepping away reads more as completion of duty than a choice with visible internal cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, planting the clock) but lack competing impulses that would raise the stakes of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher's motives remain abstract—"rediscover the wild frontier of your mind" reads as prompt language rather than dramatized desire. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("hesitated; without the gear she might forget her name") but never embodied in simultaneous impulses acting in scene. The final choice to drop the gear lacks visible cost because the transformation into a tree feels like elevation rather than forfeiture, and no hierarchy of values emerges through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ferry guides remain largely external and interchangeable, with minimal individuated interiority beyond role descriptors. Marta and Jun's actions—approaching, speaking, stamping—serve allegorical function rather than embodied choice under pressure. The hound's "crisis" is asserted through summary ("having discovered that the courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Emotional states are labeled ("mournful howl," "desperate searching") without contradictory embodiment or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bellhop's interiority is concretely embodied through the piano bench bolt and his counting of heartbeats, with motivation rooted in his mother's final lullaby. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between his role as silence-keeper and his longing for sound, particularly in the dream sequences. The boy's characterization is thinner—mostly passive recipient—and the surgeon remains functional. The final choice to pass the bolt forward reads as earned but lacks visible cost in the moment; the bellhop's stance doesn't demonstrably foreclose a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The titan's motivation is clear—restoring balance by unmasking the pretender—but his interiority remains abstract and distanced throughout. No embodied emotion appears; the prose tells us he acts with "regally unpretentious" calm and that balance is "the first law his kind had sworn to keep" without showing internal contradiction or cost. The pretender is sketched only through externals (licking his thumb, wearing "borrowed gravitas"), never granted contradictory impulses or a dramatized stake that would make the sundering feel like genuine loss rather than mechanical exposure. The titan's final forgetting of the man's face is asserted mercy, not an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's role as witness is established and her agency drives the descent, but interior contradiction remains thin—her choice to descend reads as compelled by discovery rather than genuinely conflicted desire. The tapping ritual creates character texture, yet the core tension between documenting loss and pursuing hidden invitation never manifests as simultaneous opposing impulses in a single beat. Embodied emotion is present (eel waking in chest) but much interiority leans abstract ("delayed revelation," "assembly of clues"). The final realization about her role shifts understanding but doesn't foreclose a live path with visible cost; she resumes the same tapping practice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stargazer's motivation is clear and her physicality ("soles tasting the dust," "bare arches") anchors her throughout. However, her progression from observer to activist lacks sufficient internal contradiction; her "awkwardly confident" trait is labeled but not dramatized through conflicting impulses that complicate choices. The climactic decision to broadcast the lullaby feels unmotivated by prior character work—she moves from contemplation to grand action without visible struggle or cost that would foreclose other paths. The embodied details are strong, but the final choice arrives without the earned hesitation or trade-off needed for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nara's interior texture is concrete and character-specific—"accidentally telepathic with plants" manifests in lived action (moss blooming, speaking through chlorophyll), not label-only. The renunciation cost ("knees screaming," walking slower, hiding the embryo) is visible on the page and forecloses compliance. Minor slip: the guard's soporific nap and dreamy resolution feel slightly convenient, reducing earned struggle at that pivot. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (rebellion through nurture, risk despite age) register clearly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior contradiction operates throughout: the narrator simultaneously holds grief and seeks daily return, maps pain onto plant names while trying to dissect trauma for mercy. Embodied emotion is concrete—"cold sweat," resin "like incense and iodine," tears that "salt the soil"—and avoids therapy-speak labels in peak moments. The final renunciation (releasing the photograph) is earned by the somatic-mapping ritual and carries visible cost: trading the physical token for a resin-sealed memory. Minor slip: "quietly talented" reads as a label rather than shown constraint until the somatic markers dramatize it late.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interiority is heavily stylized and abstract, leaning on rhetorical questions rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—stepping through the mirror—feels more like yielding to a symbolic logic than a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is declared through metaphor ("luminescent ache") rather than shown through bodily reaction or micro-choice under pressure. The endurance reads more as narrative inevitability than earned renunciation with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through action (handling ink, following the drone), but interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("serene anger," "consciously wild") rather than specific contradiction. The sister's choice to vanish willingly is asserted late without dramatized internal conflict on the page. Lyra exists only as traces and journal exposition, flattening what could be a relationship crucible. The final acceptance feels unmotivated by prior micro-choices; Kael moves from searcher to willing disappearer without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's choice to upload contraband truths emerges from clear motivation (preserve every story, not bury scandals) and shows embodied tension—hands shaking, pulse drumming—yet the internal conflict feels somewhat ornamental. The piece claims she is "bravely conflicted" and torn between duty and conscience, but the decision unfolds without substantive struggle; guilt appears only after the upload is irreversible, reading more as reflection than contradiction acting in scene. The final pod re-entry with sedatives flooding her veins gestures toward cost, but the renunciation lacks prior causality that would make the forfeit visceral. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated register ("archivist and anarchist fused") that sits oddly against crisis pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is consistent and character-particular; her grief and determination filter through concrete sensory choices (pressing palm to sand, weaving canvas). Internal contradiction surfaces when she inherits her father's perception but chooses her mother's path, though this tension never escalates into a genuine on-page dilemma that forces a costly choice. The final act (planting the hybrid cutting) feels symbolically complete but lacks a visible forfeiture or renunciation that would foreclose an alternate path. Embodied emotion is present throughout, but the closure remains contemplative rather than decisively altered by internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's cool-headedness is consistently embodied through her controlled exhalations and refusal to quicken her pulse, and the rail spike choice (driving it into the loam rather than striking the goddess) demonstrates agency under pressure. However, her interiority remains thin—we see calm but not the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle beneath it. The final smile and understanding feel more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing desires or fears.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cordelia's journey from guilt-driven heiress to someone who can "walk away, devotedly observant" shows earned progression. Her use of the rosewood nib as both literal tool and emotional anchor grounds her interiority. However, the internal contradiction feels more performed than embodied—the stakes of "regret that orbited her heart" remain abstract until the climactic writing scene. The resolution (tucking the broken nib into a newspaper) works as renunciation but the cost reads symbolic rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tattooist's motivation (hushing guilt over the boy's death) is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Key moments like "the stars she wore on her own collarbone would stop burning" gesture at pain without grounding it in specific, character-particular thought or action under pressure. The final choice to "slice the paper chain" and choose RELEASE INSECT reads as allegorical ritual rather than a decision earned by on-page struggle between contradictory impulses. Interiority leans toward label-like emotional states ("dissonance," "guilt") without the micro-hesitations or irrational specificity that would make her feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" after erasing her life's work is present, but her interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to scatter the mandala and walk away with "pockets light, ears open" reads as earned renunciation, but the emotional progression through the grotto ritual feels more symbolic than conflicted—her internal debate is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The trait "socially perceptive" appears twice as a label without constraining a visible on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Asha's internal arc from "gentle radical" to "Iron Cradle" is traced through concrete moments (the mother burning the book), but the transformation relies heavily on summarized reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The motivational core—"aberrant mercy"—is told more than shown in conflicted action. Embodied emotion is present in isolated beats (pressing palm to minaret, arranging tesserae) but the peak choice to leave and teach others feels unmotivated by prior on-page causality. The final renunciation lacks visible cost that would foreclose a path with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost's motivation is clear (needs an encore to stitch memory together) and embodied through the coin-pressing gesture. However, the protagonist makes no meaningful choice under pressure; he follows a nightly ritual, encounters Lila who delivers the solution, and simply performs the prescribed action. Internal contradiction is absent—his longing is stated but never conflicts with a competing impulse or cost. The change at the end (outline sharpening into the young actor) feels granted rather than earned by a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation crystallizes on the page ("needed to illuminate these hidden pathways") and her actions follow a coherent arc from discovery to helping others. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract processing ("affectionate skepticism," "willowglass hope") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from private artist to public healer proceeds too smoothly without genuine internal friction—no visible cost attends her shift from solitary work to becoming a community beacon. Mrs. Chen's relief is shown, but Mira's own stake in privacy versus connection never dramatizes a competing impulse that would deepen her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aera's motivation is concrete—to map emotions before the oceans swallow them—and the fossil-pressing choice at sternum is embodied and consequential. However, the interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("ache older than grammar," "throat raw with salt") that distances us from moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The transformation sequence (fossil to seed) reads more as mystical process than character struggle; we don't see her weigh cost or resist the pull, only comply. The final state ("lighter by the mass of one fear") gestures at change but the fear itself was never dramatized as a competing impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The hourglass turner remains more cipher than character—her motivations are asserted (choosing to "unscramble" a broken prophecy) but her interior life consists almost entirely of metaphoric perception without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The button-cataloging feels like symbolic labor rather than psychologically motivated choice; we never see her wrestle with competing impulses or pay a visible personal cost. The pocketed buttons at the end (walrus ivory, red Bakelite) are talismans, not decisions that foreclose paths. Interiority is consistently elevated and poetic but never particular enough to reveal a mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority shows genuine contradiction—"prudently daring, because there was nothing left to lose"—and his choices (powering the transmitter, crushing the pillbox) constrain future options with visible cost. However, the emotional arc leans heavily on abstract courage metaphors rather than embodied sensation under peak stress; phrases like "silver hush of responsibility" and "gardeners of possible futures" read as writerly distance when the moment calls for immediate pressure. The ending choice is earned by prior causality, but the interior voice sometimes abstracts rather than inhabits the scarred body and burned identity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's motivation to "distill complexity into essence" drives his acceptance of the girl's offer, and his interiority shows embodied awareness through the tingling palimpsest and the weight of the sphere. However, the girl functions more as a symbolic figure than a character with distinct agency or contradiction; her actions feel predetermined by allegorical role rather than emergent choice. The coachman's transformation from ferrier to wanderer is earned but the emotional cost reads conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Internal conflict is present (thirty years versus the promise) but never complicates the forward movement with genuine hesitation or competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lin's embodied connection to the oasis (thumb to leaf, pulse) and her decisive action with the clay hive show agency under pressure. Her motivation to "tend kindness" and restore fractured timelines is consistent, though the interiority leans heavily on abstract perception ("phototropic to kindness," "thrum inside her skull") rather than contradictory impulses. The final choice to project the lantern glass and guide "every gentle thing home" is earned, but her internal conflict remains understated—she moves through the narrative with calm competence rather than struggle. The child's introduction adds a secondary character, but the relationship remains minimal and does not pressure Lin's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through consistent micro-choices—stealing the gauge tooth, working the lock, descending to find the boy—each action grounded in her role as fire escape gardener who knows municipal fines yet coaxes life from paint buckets. Internal contradiction appears in "translation" versus theft, and her final teaching moment reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost (the gauge tooth falls, nasturtium roots). The boy's presence and reaction are underdeveloped; his interiority remains opaque, limiting relationship crucible. Minor penalty for the somewhat abstracted emotional register in peak beats ("quivering hush," "protected vulnerability") that occasionally drifts toward label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gryphon's interior state is vividly embodied through "brittle awakening," "crack inside her sternum," and "fissures admitted moonlight"—concrete, character-particular imagery that grounds loneliness as physical pressure. The final choice to refuse the chorus is motivated by prior interiority (translating isolation into independence) and foreclosed with visible cost (stepping backward, accepting solitude). Minor deduction: the middle beats lean on abstract language ("unmapped space, continents of possibility") that edges toward platitude, and the broader motivation remains more asserted than tested through micro-choices under genuine competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghostwriter's motivations and interior world are articulated through lyric compression rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist remains largely passive until the final beats; her central choice—placing the twig spiral—reads as symbolic gesture rather than a decision with visible alternatives foreclosed. Interiority leans toward thematic meditation ("the thread that connects all things is not love itself but the telling of it") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final "I am here" stakes a claim but arrives without the weight of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and embodied—her physical manipulation of equipment reflects urgency and her micro-choices under pressure (killing the sine generator, embracing chaos) reveal agency. Internal contradiction is present: she doesn't delude herself that harmony is won, yet still hopes interference might be love. The "cautiously hopeful" tag appears as voice texture rather than decision-shaping friction. Minor deduction: her plan unfolds with high competence and little genuine struggle or compounding mistake that tests her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin's claustrophobia is embodied through physical pressure ("weight of the iron night felt denser than stone," "chest tightened") and her countering tactics (humming sea shanties, counting breaths). Her internal contradiction—fear versus "wistful rebellion"—drives the descent choice with visible cost: sealing the tunnels forever behind her. The mirror-chamber reflections elegantly compress her arc from hiding child to key-bearer. Minor slip: "prudently adventurous" reads as authorial label rather than emerging from dramatized choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Juniper's internal stakes are vivid—face-blindness as "mercy, not curse"—and the palm-slicing choice forces a visceral trade-off. However, the babysitter memory arrives so late that the prior thirty-six years of motivation feel retroactively inserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final portrait choice reads more as epiphany than as a decision that forecloses a credible alternative path with visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's core motivation (honoring Edda) is established early and drives her choices, but interior contradiction is minimal—she moves through each beat with steady determination rather than conflicted impulses. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the nail pulsing, trembling hands) but much of the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory experience under pressure. The final choice to stay another season feels thematically resonant but is told rather than dramatized with visible internal cost or foreclosed path. The relationship with Voss shifts from threat to ally too smoothly without sustained friction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fiddler's motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of never") is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("luminous disbelief made audible") without embodied sensation. The father's death and the hitchhiker's vanishing are recounted rather than forcing micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously; the piece narrates emotional states instead of dramatizing contradictory wants colliding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jonah's interior world is grounded in concrete particulars—the leather folder, his mother's bills, his father's death—and his reflective search for why "paths circle back" drives his renunciation at the end. His final choice to walk east with one less bill feels earned by the spiral ritual and Mara's mirroring. However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward lyric summary ("the retelling of his father's choices") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and Mara's transformation from "burn the shirts" to shared ritual happens quickly without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is heavy on abstract declaration ("I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The temple's grief transferred to her insomnia is told rather than embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The boy's shift from constellation names to speaking her name at the end is a soft gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. The protagonist witnesses more than she decides, and the final "settling" of stories feels like asserted resolution rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Briar's motivation is embodied through the flesh-eating seed at her wrist and her confession on the seventh circle, creating contradictory impulses—love of trees versus village survival—that act simultaneously in scene. The choice to speak rather than freeze the confession is earned by prior causality, with visible cost (the plant binding her arm, her kneeling posture). Minor weakness: the druid's "gift" to find lost things is stated but never shown constraining a choice on the page, functioning more as atmospheric backstory than active trait. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular throughout, avoiding label-speak even under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist exhibits consistent visionary traits and embodied anxiety ("lungs fizzing with anxious elation"), but internal contradiction is limited—the choice to graft feels predetermined rather than wrestling competing desires. The child-self encounter offers a gesture toward complexity but dissolves into pollen before creating friction. The final transformation reads more as mystical inevitability than a choice that forecloses a legible alternate path with visible cost scaled to the protagonist's prior wants.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation is concretely embodied—"holes that whistled at night"—and the final choice to surrender the mother-humming memory shows genuine cost. Lira's "fiercely gentle" trait operates through gesture and action across beats. The ending's acceptance of permanent gaps ("some holes must remain") earns the shift from repair-seeking to witness stance. Minor: the narrator's agency feels reactive rather than driving turns until the gate bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mason's interiority is vivid and particular, grounded in concrete objects (grille cloth scrap, reel-to-reel) that anchor memory to present choice. The final acceptance of the foreman's offer reflects a meaningful shift from solitary artifact-hunting to community archival work, closing one path with visible cost. However, the opening sprawls through backstory without acute present pressure, and several beats rely on stock metaphors ("kick drum" pulse, "vacuum" of silence) rather than embodied contradiction. The attribute "confidently uncertain" is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is richly layered—"haunted ambitions" and the mother's vanishing establish contradictory pulls—but key micro-choices arrive via mechanism (the seed's heat, the filament's runes) rather than her deliberation under pressure. The final realization about haunted ambitions is stated cleanly but lacks embodied cost; we don't see what Mira forgoes or endures to reach it. The mother's waveform presence reads more as conceptual wish-fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a path, weakening the closure's emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The titan-gear librarian is richly described with embodied details (brass rib-cage, copper boots, pistons), but her motivation remains largely abstract and told rather than shown through difficult choices under pressure. Her interior state is presented through metaphor-heavy description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final stance—closing her rib-cage and climbing to upper galleries—reads as ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. No other characters appear on the page, so relationship pressure cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's central motivation (dissolving walls between hearts) is stated early but remains largely abstract until the crown-wearing sequence. The piece offers embodied moments—pressing pearl to wall, kneeling to confess—but her internal contradiction never sharpens into a dramatized choice with visible cost; she moves through the cave more as witness than agent under pressure. The final transformation into glass reads as external consequence rather than earned renunciation. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("collective weight," "throat ached") without the micro-choices that would ground her struggle in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is established early (self-forgiveness quest) and her micro-choices—stopping lithium, descending into the tunnel, playing the accordion, releasing it to the water—are causally linked to her guilt catalogue. The interiority leans heavily on poetic metaphor ("river inside her mind") and label-heavy backstory (plagiarized article, abandoned lover, skipped funeral) rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the accordion) carries visible cost and forecloses return, but the peak beats rely on symbolic gesture more than contradictory impulses colliding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains abstract throughout—her choices feel predetermined by the premise rather than emerging from contradictory impulses. The golden-thread mouth reveal arrives late and functions as decor rather than a constraint that shaped prior choices. Internal experience is largely narrated in elevated, distanced language ("cautious exuberance") that never degrades under the stated crisis pressure. The transformation into the library reads as conceptual fulfillment rather than a choice earned by visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is present and she makes the pivotal choice to play the violin, but her decision process relies heavily on external nudging (the cereus's commands, the coffee-stain vision) rather than internal contradiction acting in scene. The interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("mulberry ache in her throat—half grief, half ripeness") rather than embodied, character-particular sensation. The choice to condemn the empire's harvests feels insufficiently earned; we see little struggle between her professional ethics and revolutionary impulse before the bow touches the strings.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    The beautician mortician's interior life is delivered almost entirely through summary and label ("wonder," "grief," "shield against forgetting") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's final choice—stepping into the pool—feels preordained by the prose rather than earned through on-page pressure that forecloses other paths. Motivations are asserted ("she needed that spark") but never tested against a competing impulse or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The ending dispersal reads as symbolic inevitability rather than a decision with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The caretaker's motivation to forgive and find contentment is present but lacks embodied contradiction—her journey reads more as symbolic ascent than genuine internal struggle. The boy's identity as "the next you" born from forgiveness feels abstract rather than earned through prior causal pressure. Emotional progression relies heavily on metaphoric language ("knees scallop inward," "grief-shaped mouth") that substitutes for concrete behavioral choices under pressure. The final reconciliation with the sister and the hairpin's emergence lack visible cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's profession is established but her interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The geologist's final moment shows embodied tension ("stared at the shard's void"), yet the team functions primarily as a collective with minimal individual differentiation. The closure choice feels more thematic declaration than earned struggle; we're told she "never gave before" without prior scene evidence of what she typically does give.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to teach is clear and her backwards-aging premise is conceptually interesting, but her interiority reads as expository rather than embodied. Marcus remains a receptacle for instruction with no contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal him under pressure. The final "understanding" arrives as narrative summary rather than earned decision with visible cost: "knowing you would vanish was different from understanding that vanishing was simply another way of appearing somewhere else" is told wisdom, not dramatized stake.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Cael remains a static vessel for lyric description rather than a character making choices under pressure. His interiority consists entirely of generic mystical statements ("he understood now that to navigate without moving meant to become the echo itself") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice that would reveal character particularity. The grandmother's arrowhead merging with his sternum and his "becoming the song" are asserted transformations without any on-page struggle, doubt, or visible cost that would earn the change. The prose tells us he is "historically reverent by nature" but never dramatizes what he renounces or what competing desire he must overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's internal state is embodied through concrete actions—touching frost, stepping onto vapor despite past failure, wrapping his badge around the keystone—and these choices narrow his options with visible cost. His "underachieving" identity drives the renunciation at closure, forfeiting credentials to preserve wonder. Minor slip: the mason flashback and "sacred in the simple" confession feel slightly abstract, edging toward epiphany rather than pure dramatization. The embodied contradiction between quota-driven performance and unmeasured joy is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound drives his descent, and embodied details appear (the brass key cold at his throat, boots on tilting deck). However, interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor rather than contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ending grants him realization without visible renunciation or cost that forecloses a path; he returns to his job enriched but unchanged in circumstance or commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior is highly stylized but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her choices follow a single path of mystical transcendence without visible internal friction or cost that would make the sacrifice legible as a character-driven decision. The "quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the piece substitutes elevated metaphor for physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's arc from ignorance to self-awareness is structurally present and the final renunciation (tearing the page, releasing paper souls) shows agency with cost. Interior contradictions exist—he carries ghosts yet never considered himself worthy of sacrifice—but the plague-cot memory feels inserted rather than earned through prior causality. Embodied emotion is present (warm streak "absurdly like a tear") yet much of the interiority leans toward abstract philosophical register ("humanity's terror had been feeding him") rather than character-particular perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his "lukewarm mage" trait creates a plausible obstacle, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("those griefs," "brittle devotion") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from active effort to passive keeper is summarized across years rather than dramatized with visible internal cost. The children and dolphin appear as symbolic placeholders without distinct pressure or relationship dynamics that would test Kael's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marisol's interior is well-embodied through specific memories (the anise drop, her father's script) and her night-patrol choice shows character-particular caution. The photograph trail triggers a recognizable emotional arc—grief over her father's foreclosed life—that motivates her final act of tearing the label and reframing the town's story. Minor slip: the leap from private grief to "museum of common loss" feels slightly under-dramatized; the decision to photograph the town is told more than shown in micro-choices that test competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interior is richly textured through embodied perception (mica flashing, metallic scent) and micro-choices (kneeling, counting heartbeats, placing the crystal). Her motivation to reconcile logic and reverence drives choices, though the final transformation feels more mystical than psychologically earned—the agency shift from active seeker to passive recipient weakens the arc. The "secretly sentimental" attribute exists only as a told label in one sentence without constraining any on-page choice. Internal contradiction is present (logic vs. intuition) but resolved too smoothly; the crystal placement above her heart and subsequent touching feel more ritual than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between vigilance and letting go is embodied through concrete gestures—the buckle, the tally marks, the descent—and the encounter forces a choice that forecloses her prior stance with visible cost. However, the older-self encounter leans heavily on symbolic conveyance rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the decision to pass the buckle feels more allegorical than psychologically knotted. Interiority remains specific to the watcher role, but the final peace arrives without sufficient dramatized resistance or ambivalence in the peak beat. The piece earns endurance-as-agency but stops short of the tension required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's journey from ego death to synthesis carries embodied stakes—trembling palms, the void where self was—but her agency feels passive through most turns. The final choice to merge is more declaration than earned contradiction; Zero's tears arrive as a pivot marker rather than through dramatized internal conflict. The brain-as-discarded-self offers concrete grounding, yet the protagonist observes more than she decides until the abrupt pour-and-merge ending.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ellery's grief-driven agency is embodied and contradictory—he conducts impossible music to "tend" memory, knowing it cannot restore Quinn. The moment he hears the giggle and chooses to kneel rather than pursue it demonstrates earned acceptance with visible cost. Minor slip: "macerate...hope shredding muscle" edges into anatomical overwrite that momentarily pulls focus from the emotional choice. The wife's surprised chuckle at the end completes the relational arc with felt change.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's interiority is richly textured through embodied metaphor (frost as marginalia, paw prints as turning pages), and the core contradiction—cataloguer turned feral, caught between states—is sustained throughout. However, motivation remains abstract: the nightly ritual of offering and withdrawing the pendant never crystallizes into a concrete choice with visible tradeoff. The final turn ("stepped toward the boundary without stepping through") registers as renunciation, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, and the agency reads passive—she turns back because crossing would violate the friendship with uncertainty, not because she sacrifices a legible want.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's motivation (interrupting destiny) is present but mostly told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Interior experience relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("cold bloom of data where hope should have been") rather than embodied contradiction. The creature-staff interaction at the end offers a choice (offering goggles), but the emotional arc feels pre-decided rather than emergent from scene pressure. Interiority reads more as atmospheric narration than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The interpreter's interiority is consistent and voice-specific, with embodied sensations ("serenely electric pins") and micro-choices (unscrewing the hatch, discarding assumptions). However, the protagonist's agency reads as passive observation punctuated by technical gestures rather than choices under conflicting pressure. The final walk-down lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths; she simply descends lighter and wiser, which doesn't earn the transformation arc claimed. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from discovery to epiphany without genuine struggle or misbelief that compounds stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arden's motivation to anchor the ferry and save the passengers is clear, but interiority leans heavily on metaphoric declaration ("slipping sideways," "resiliently positive grin") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to merge timelines arrives through the hourglass mechanism rather than dramatized internal conflict between competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (steering patterns, flipping the hourglass twice) but the renunciation or cost feels more asserted than felt—"the pourer must choose which" is told, not shown through a visible forfeiture that narrows his options. The character reads consistent and the arc lands, but the peak beat lacks the visceral trade-off that would elevate it into high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists more as a conceptual vehicle than a character with embodied stakes. Her "fever dream architect" role is asserted through label ("unsettling calm," "her fevered mind") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The composite man appears as pure symbol without pressure application, and the protagonist's weaving proceeds without visible trade-offs or forfeited paths. No on-page choice narrows options with felt cost; the ending declares understanding ("she was the thread") rather than earning it through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The instructor's interiority is concrete and rooted in loss—"the hollow that ached like lungs remembering air"—and her teaching carries embodied stakes. The boy's desire to return is motivated, and the final exchange at the spire shows choice under pressure. However, the emotional progression relies on poetic assertion more than micro-choices that narrow options; the instructor's "thin smile" and the boy's bleeding fingers are told rather than dramatized in action. The final renunciation (giving away the chain link) carries symbolic weight but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and drives her investigation, though the stakes remain largely abstract until late. Her micro-choices—pocketing the photograph, lying to Hask, uploading evidence—show agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but muted: her defiance of Hask feels more procedural than deeply conflicted. The emotional arc compresses decades of backstory into urgency without fully embodying the cost of confrontation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's claustrophobia is embodied through physical constraint ("pressed her back," "knees scraped volcanic glass") and her motivation to witness the technicians is consistent throughout. Internal conflict shows in "her claustrophobia screamed, but the gold fleck sang louder," demonstrating contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The twelve technicians are individuated through names and distinct deaths, though their interior lives remain sketched. The final choice to carry their story ashore feels earned by prior witness-bearing, though the transition from fear to "wider fear—and obligation" edges toward summary rather than fully embodied decision.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific—"I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind" anchors the digital ghost state concretely. The motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" drives the observatory sequence, and the choice to speak to the clerk feels earned by the ink-map realization. However, the emotional arc from morgue-drawer survivor to wisdom-bearer compresses too quickly; the protagonist's internal contradictions (refusal at flatline, acceptance of error-as-corridor) are told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—leaving the shard as a "bookmark"—lands with thematic clarity but minimal visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's journey from fear to acceptance follows a clear arc, but her interior life remains largely abstract—"feared the curse, but feared silence more" declares motivation without embodied contradiction. The calcification sequence provides physical stakes, yet the decision to swallow the diamond lacks dramatic hesitation or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices (placing the diamond, waiting for moonrise, speaking the first word) advance the ritual but don't reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The ending fixes her as a statue-conduit, which reads as transformation, but the cost feels predetermined rather than fought.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's transformation arc is signaled early and paid off at closure, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "researcher undercover" premise never generates meaningful tension between her scientific stance and the supernatural phenomenon—she accepts and joins the metamorphosis without visible internal resistance or cost to her former identity. Motivation is declared ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") but never dramatized as a choice that forecloses other paths; the ending feels like inevitable absorption rather than a decision with visible trade-offs. The final beats lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; Mara simply unfolds into the chorus without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Calla's goal (uproot the seed of beauty) is clear, but her interior process remains largely abstract—she "understands" and "signals" without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The statues' shift from threat to ally lacks earned causality; their sudden cooperation feels convenient rather than motivated by Calla's prior choices. Emotional states are asserted through poetic abstraction ("breathless pause that tasted of iron and apricot") rather than specific physical sensation tied to her body under pressure. The final walk away forecloses no visible path with cost; she succeeds fully without meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Riven's choices drive the arc—he seeks the console, trades storm for letters, and retrieves his mother's envelope—but interiority leans heavily on poetic metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. "Every absence he had ever fostered… pressed against his ribs" illustrates internal pressure, yet the language remains abstract and the micro-choices feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded. The final move (trading weather for words) carries conceptual weight but lacks visceral cost or bodily friction during execution. Motivation is coherent and change is visible, yet the piece skirts diagnostic clarity in favor of lyric density, weakening the felt stakes at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carpenter's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory memory (sandpaper rasp, brass warmth) and his central motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—shapes the search credibly. However, his character remains somewhat static; the discovery scene feels contemplative rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final walk away reads as symbolic closure but lacks a visible on-page choice that forecloses a prior path with felt cost, capping the score below high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ms. Penumbra remains a static observer throughout; her "sanely eccentric mind" is label-only, never constraining a choice or creating visible tradeoff. The scarf guides her passively through dimensional shifts, but she makes no consequential decisions—she simply follows its warmth and observes pre-narratives without struggle or cost. The final "smile" and return to her post suggest no meaningful change or renunciation earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction is absent; she processes metaphysical complexity with perfect equanimity and no embodied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mireya's motivation (to capture the runaway dream and restore erased voices) is established early and drives her journey to the easternmost islet. However, her interior life remains abstract—painted in metaphorical sweeps rather than embodied contradictions. The final "airy saturation" and cipher spelling across her skin reads as declared transformation without the micro-choices and embodied cost that would anchor change. Agency at closure is present but feels more cosmic than character-driven, limiting the score despite clear goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith operates almost entirely in metaphor without concrete internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation ("free an idea trapped behind fear") remains abstract throughout; we never see her wrestle with competing impulses in scene. The transformation at closure—speaking her first sentence of the new life—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as declarative rather than earned through prior causality. Interiority relies on elevated poetic register ("improbable longing," "sympathetic code") that distances rather than embodies emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior demonstrates coherent curiosity and a value hierarchy (choosing reclamation over forgetting), but the final pivot lacks embodied contradiction—she moves cleanly from temptation to refusal without visible struggle in the moment. The insight "memories had never been taken; they had been offered" arrives as assertion rather than earned realization through scene pressure. Backstory functions within BRR allowances, anchored to present stimuli (corroded sextant, mushroom glow), but the reflective density flattens some present-tense pressure mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to preserve memory and mentor through example is clear and coherent. Her backward walking and mirror-shard annotations are embodied traits with texture. However, the child's arrival and immediate understanding feel unmotivated; the protagonist's interior contradiction (refusal versus acceptance) resolves without visible cost or struggle in the present scene. The mentor's teacup functions more as symbol than lived choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arin's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and sustained, and his shift from hoarding to sharing marks a clean arc. However, the interiority remains abstract—"insatiably creative mind saw the pattern" tells rather than dramatizes perception, and his peak choice to "fling the remaining droplets" lacks embodied hesitation or competing impulses. The final renunciation (wandering instead of tending) is legible but arrives without visible friction between want and cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to give voices back to the voiceless is clear and shapes his actions throughout. Interiority leans poetic but remains character-specific ("fracture lines like fault lines in his own chest"). The fisherman's spirit materializes and thanks him, providing relationship pressure, but the arc feels more illustrative than internally conflicted—Elian succeeds without meaningful obstruction or cost that tests competing impulses. The final realization about broken things letting light through borders on epiphany-speak but stays tied to his craft.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's perceptual signature—framing silence as language—remains consistent and drives her choices. Internal contradiction appears in her flicker of distrust versus methodical trust in maps, and her final choice to leave without translating the silence shows renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("curled inside her ribs like warm smoke"), though some moments lean toward abstract perception ("empathy was the compass"). The motivation shift from curiosity to interpretive empathy is earned through concrete experiences with the footage and chapel, but the closure choice feels more passive witnessing than active forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to understand letting go is clear and her ritual of noting corrosion anchors her character, but the interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to release the notebook feels more thematic than earned by competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Elias as Death-with-her-brother's-face provides a charged relationship frame, but his function remains largely expository rather than forcing micro-choices that reveal Mara's hierarchy of values. The great-grandmother backstory arrives late and tilts the present stance, yet the path from recognition to release unfolds smoothly without visible struggle or cost that forecloses another option.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict—she paints, the echo objects once, she continues. The echo conversation ("You're encoding us away") gestures at tension but dissolves immediately into cosmic resolution without visible cost or a foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is scarce; most interiority is abstract ("tasting metal," "driftingly alert") without character-particular texture. The final descent carries no legible choice or renunciation that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's curiosity is consistently portrayed through concrete actions—gathering pages methodically, tracing symbols, humming notes—and her progression from servant to agency-bearing actor is embodied rather than declared. The captain remains a cipher whose smile and wager are told rather than dramatized, limiting his impact on present tension. Minor interiority phrases like "she felt the goggles translate" skirt abstraction but anchor quickly in sensory detail. The final renunciation ("a servant no longer ascending but expanding") carries visible cost—she chooses roots over mobility—but the choice feels more lyric declaration than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior is present but relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The core motivation (proving clouds remember) drives the action, but her choices feel predetermined by the elegiac frame rather than tested by competing impulses. The telescope becomes a confessional booth, yet we see no visceral resistance or doubt—she moves through the ritual smoothly. The final step into空 reads as symbolic inevitability rather than a choice forged from contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's prosopagnosia is conceptually strong but operates primarily as thematic texture rather than forcing concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to preserve the guild's memory is clear, yet the peak moment—painting the sky—unfolds without visible internal contradiction or competing impulses that would complicate the act. The final realization ("painting her own face after all") arrives as an epiphany rather than being earned through prior on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present in tactile details (palm against coin, candle flame dancing) but the interiority leans toward abstract insight ("limitation is not failure but filter") that edges into diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is consistent—curiosity-driven, tied to her mother's legacy—and her interiority carries specificity ("fingers tracing coastlines that official maps insisted did not exist"). The climactic choice to read the dialects aloud feels somewhat unmotivated; we see no prior internal deliberation about why this particular act would work, and the chief engineer's "Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn" arrives late as a new rule. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slides into stock phrases ("knees shook," "heart faltering"). The final shift from isolation to shared horizon registers, but the path feels compressed rather than earned through accumulated internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rowan's motivation is clear and specific (learning repair rhythm tied to his mentor's death), and interiority is concrete with embodied details like "coat crackling with rime" and the "irregular" tick of his own heart. The protagonist's choices drive the key turn when he understands the mirrors store better versions and heals the eclipse-key. However, the final workshop scene drifts into abstract epiphany ("to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped") that borders on label-speak, and the mentor relationship lacks on-page friction—it anchors motivation but never complicates a present choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's altruistic motivation is clear and her interiority—guiding the harvest through frost-writing—shows purposeful constraint. The colonists are sketched functionally (Kai's barefoot reading, coffee-brewing) but lack contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; their collective shift from quarrel to cooperation is told rather than dramatized. The final choice (Mara's release) feels earned by her sustained effort, but the cost reads more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. Internal conflict within Mara ("why follow a ghost who might vanish") is asserted then resolved without lingering friction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The adjuster's interiority is richly layered—recognition of the puppet head from "the nursery of her first life" carries embodied history, and the final choice to become "the pane's silvered backing" forecloses her existence with visible cost. However, motivation remains abstract: the drive to "vouchsafe the lullaby" across lifetimes is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting wants. The piece leans heavily on reflection and symbolic gesture; micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under immediate pressure are sparse, and the protagonist's agency reads more as submission to a ritual than a decision that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and rooted in duty, her micro-choices (pressing warmth-ghosts, timing her breath, crushing the nut-kernel) are goal-driven and embodied. The piece avoids therapy-speak and maintains POV discipline. Internal conflict is present but could deepen—her hatred of the orchard and graceless beauty are told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice (walking back to the orchard) feels earned but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's grief and professional identity are concretely embodied through her polymer-chemist lens and tactile interaction with the chrysalis. The choice to translate absence into resonance is earned by the fusion of guilt ("refusing the final call") and professional expertise. Interiority is mostly specific, though "loosened grief slipping down her cheeks" edges toward stock embodiment. The atonement arc forecloses passivity with visible cost—she builds sculptures and surrenders them—but the final renunciation could press harder against her control.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vendor demonstrates a clear goal (to sell clean slates, map negative space where stories begin) and her actions pursue it, but her motivation remains abstract and label-based rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or concrete stakes. The boy and librarian apply immediate pressure, yet their interactions feel more like conceptual demonstrations than genuine crucible moments that force the vendor into hard trade-offs. The final self-erasure reads as a preordained thematic gesture rather than a choice earned by visible internal conflict. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("incise the day," "quantifying absence") without grounding emotional states in body or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's gift is clearly established and drives her descent into the pavilion, with embodied sensory experience ("tasting the memory of every soul") and contradiction shown when her gift reverses at the climax. However, interiority occasionally slips into label-heavy abstraction ("million-year cycles of growth and decay") rather than grounded perception. The final transformation feels asserted more than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose prior paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mireya's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "empathetically decisive" gift reads as a label without embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The piece tells us she "felt the tower's wheeze" and "knew she must rehabilitate" but offers no on-page struggle or competing desire—she simply executes a sequence of technical tasks. Emotional states remain abstract ("exhausted," "confident") without embodied tension or genuine flaws that complicate the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation is clear and her "helix-minded" trait shows in her tinkering and recursive planning. The piece offers concrete embodied detail ("boots grinding red grit," "blood threading from her hairline") and her contradictory impulses appear in the phrase "each twitch of the wrench both error and correction." However, interiority leans toward poetic description rather than genuine internal conflict; the arc from attempt to failure to resolve feels more like a prescribed pattern than earned struggle. The final smile and immediate pivot to "already modifying tomorrow's helmet" arrives without sufficient on-page cost to her stance or self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilyra's motivation is clear and her archivist expertise shapes her navigation through the grotto, though her internal conflict remains largely abstract—she's solving a puzzle rather than wrestling with competing desires. The "prism-minded" trait and her mentor's teaching appear as backstory labels that explain technique but don't complicate choices. Her success feels ordained by competence rather than earned through visible struggle or trade-offs that foreclose paths. The final smile suggests satisfaction without dramatized cost to her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilay's motivation is clear and consistent—symphonically minded, driven to restore music—and her embodied actions (ear to wood, breath matching pulse) show empathy in motion. Internal experience differs from external behavior in purposeful ways (she trembles but does not cheer). However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her path is smooth and unopposed, with no meaningful struggle or foreclosed alternative that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's exile and internal conflict are established, but his interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("vast, aching absence," "hopeful melancholy"). The worry stone gesture recurs but doesn't reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—it's a static meditation loop. The final choice to "teach the world" lacks on-page cost or concrete stakes; it reads as resolved epiphany rather than earned transformation through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mirelle's interiority is vivid and particular—her tactile cataloging ("cedar smelled like truce, iron like surrender") grounds her pacifist stance in embodied action. However, her arc leans heavily on epiphany and lacks genuine struggle; the radio-tuning sequence feels more like orchestrated revelation than earned confrontation. Internal contradiction is gestured at (wanting to open versus listening through) but not dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure. The sister's absence removes relational crucible; Mirelle's choices face no on-page resistance that could compound her blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Myrrh's olfactory sensitivity and ambition drive consistent micro-choices (testing seed readiness, timing the graft, breathing through her mouth). Interiority is concrete and embodied through scent perception. The shift from "ambition loosen[s] into gratitude" reads earned through the tree's reciprocal holding-still, though the final epiphany risks slight abstraction. Internal contradiction appears briefly but could press harder under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aera's motivation is clear and her micro-choices during the inversion hour show agency under pressure. However, interiority often reads as elevated poetic abstraction rather than character-particular thought ("the willing transfer of endurance across years" feels like theme-speak). The moment she "understood: this was the gathering of echoes" and later realizes "the source of resilience was not a place but a process" edges toward authorial explanation rather than embodied discovery. The final choice to keep the arrow and share its meaning has causal grounding but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would elevate it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's choices drive the narrative (documenting, following, writing backward), but her interiority is often announced rather than embodied. The patch's presence against her heart and the closing her eyes of T. Holm show contradiction (compassion vs. mission), yet her voice leans toward oracular certainty ("already surveying the next place") without micro-hesitation under stress. The final choice to walk backward is striking but lands as symbolic rather than conflicted, and the "hazy precision of someone describing a dream while still inside it" declares the state without textured perception to prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interiority is present but often trades in abstract labels ("wonder needed certification") rather than embodied contradiction. The swallowing of the sheet registers as convenient transformation without visible struggle—no gag reflex, no cost beyond metaphor. His motivation to "certify wonder" is declared early but never conflicts with a competing impulse on the page; the aurora "strips away protective scales" yet we see no dramatized resistance or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's driven stance and motivation to "harvest insights from failure" are clear, but her interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—laying down the flute—reads as earned by the reflective arc, but the moment lacks the visceral cost or internal resistance that would elevate it. Emotional progression is more contemplative than conflicted; we see understanding replace certainty, but the stakes feel more conceptual than gut-level. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the flute to dust, reversing footprints) show agency, yet the piece trades dramatic tension for lyric meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Quince's interior life operates through metaphor (borrowing personalities "like printers borrow type") rather than embodied contradiction. The widow's grief and astronomer's logic are told as abstractions—"eigenvalues of sorrow, vectors of longing"—without showing distinct impulses competing in a single choice. The final choice to reverse the press feels unmotivated by prior causality; we never see what Quince wants versus what he fears. Diagnostic label-speak ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") replaces scene pressure at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias remains functional but largely abstract—his "jittery" nature is labeled repeatedly without embodied variation under stress. The pendant operates as a plot device more than an object that reveals character through handling choices. The woman at the ridgeway remains a cipher; her "centuries" claim and aurora-lit eyes are told, not dramatized through credible action. The final transformation ("part man, part story, part wonder") is asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his grief embodied through the warming prism and physical gestures (forehead to door, kneeling). The interior voice carries distinct texture ("truthful lies") and the final renunciation feels earned. However, interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("aggregate sorrow baked into vinyl and steel") that reads more poetic than character-particular, and the core change—fractured grief repositioned—lacks a visible forfeiture that would charge the final image with higher cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spinner's motivation is clear and embodied—she crushes amber, swallows voice, trades speech for message-carrying—with cost legible on the page ("sealing her muteness like frost over still water"). Interior contradiction appears in the final renunciation: she surrenders her name yet continues weaving "symbols legible only to those who listen with more than ears," a paradox that grounds the ending. Micro-choices accumulate (fitting puzzle pieces, crushing the bead, stepping through) and the silent weaving afterward demonstrates earned endurance. Minor: the spinner remains somewhat archetypal; a second on-page character or sharper internal friction would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Thistle remains a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "meek blacksmith" trait is asserted but never embodied in micro-choices; "quietly determined" appears repeatedly without dramatized internal conflict or cost. The villagers function as a distant chorus with no individuated pressure. Emotional progression is told through summary ("bartered awakening," "confusion rushed in") rather than shown through embodied perception degrading under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinctly textured through sensory perception and mapping language, with embodied choices (presses shard to deck, swallows cube, redirects future work). Internal contradiction emerges between professional complicity and present revelation, earning the final stance shift. However, the lover subplot feels ornamental rather than causally essential to the map-maker's arc, and the "withheld truth" realization arrives late without sufficient dramatized friction in earlier beats to ground the weight of self-implication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through concrete choices—adding the fourth stone, bottling the sea glass, building the second cairn—that reveal his hierarchy of values without diagnostic interiority. His motivation to "protect the tower...from forgetting" drives micro-decisions with visible cost (the pink granite from the widow's cove). Internal contradiction surfaces when fear that the keeper "might finally have stepped over the rail" competes with his ritual endurance, creating pressure without therapy-speak. The keeper remains properly off-stage, her presence felt through the stone arrangements and the single click overhead, which charges Elias's final understanding without requiring her physicalization.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows…was not a private desire but a geas soldered to her laughter centuries before") arrives as declaration rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The piece leans heavily on abstract labeling—"shadowed elation," "accidentally prophetic"—without embodying these states through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her actions (climbing, laughing, pressing the wick) follow a ritual logic but never face a genuine fork where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The ending lands her "barefoot on dew," but the cost of her transformation reads conceptual rather than felt; no prior relationship or capability is visibly forfeited on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    Hoshiko remains more vessel than agent throughout; her "watchful" trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatizes a choice-under-pressure moment where observation costs her something or forces a trade-off. The donor heart's memories do all the work, delivering epiphanies without her earning them through struggle. Interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("quietly explosive sparks," "narrative gravity") and therapy-speak abstractions rather than embodied contradiction, and the final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than a renunciation or endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is richly embodied through concrete actions—mapping dreams with chalk, unscrewing brass limbs, reading rings aloud—but her motivations remain abstract ("learn what trees witness"). The protagonist's final choice to return with "watering cans and quieter footsteps" feels decorative rather than earned by prior contradiction or cost. Internal conflict is muted: Mara proceeds methodically without meaningful hesitation or competing impulses that would deepen the stakes of her repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper's motivation (rekindle a dying realm) is clear and her actions align throughout, but interiority remains abstract—"scattered memories fluttered inside her skull like moths" describes state without embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic moment where she slams mica shards into her ribs to sharpen recollection reads as externalized pain-as-portal rather than an earned choice emerging from prior contradictory wants. Her name-recovery shout feels convenient rather than inevitable, and the final acceptance ("let them keep her name") lacks visible cost since we never see what holding it would foreclose.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's empathetic trait and her motivation to unearth wisdom are established, but her arc relies heavily on abstract interiority rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The "mis-delivery" mistake and its consequences are told rather than dramatized, weakening causal linkage to her final transformation. The disappearance into the library's "hush" reads as a conceptual maneuver more than an earned choice with visible psychological cost. Her empathy functions mostly as atmospheric description (tasting emotions from books) rather than creating on-page friction or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mila's occupation as "creeping normality noticer" is vivid, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to plant the bread is motivated by external instruction from the gardener rather than internal conflict, reducing agency. Emotional progression—tears at the reopened bakery—feels earnest but arrives without the layered irrationality or self-deception that would elevate it. The final stance (accepting tenuous absolution) is signaled but not earned through a visible on-page choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orderly records chief's trait of being "gently meticulous" is embodied through her measurement actions and recording on frozen mercury, showing character-particular interiority. Her motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" drives concrete choices under pressure—quickening measurements as the lantern fails, pressing the tablet to the tree trunk. Internal contradiction surfaces when she understands she is "translating grief into data," acknowledging futility yet persisting with methodical care. No change occurs; she descends with the same stance, which reads as Earned Stasis but lacks a visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page—her pocket still holds the frequencies, the data transfers to the tree, and no cost prevents her return.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently filtered through a moonshine-runner legacy ("liquid night," "jars of white lightning") with embodied hesitation ("each stride dying halfway," "half-moons into my skin"). Internal contradiction surfaces when she wants her father to stop her yet proceeds with the trade—this proves she craves the rescue that would preserve trust. The closing realization ("a weight I had mistaken for love") lands as earned renunciation with visible cost: she walks away lighter but emptied. Minor: Jonah's lighthouse-eyes metaphor skirts decorative; his secondary presence could carry more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's transformation from skeptic to weather-bearer occurs through exposition rather than embodied choice under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("rational mind finally tasting what her body had always known") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The woman with silver hair appears as a mystical guide delivering insights rather than forcing difficult decisions. Key moments—the convergence, the seed exchange—are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's mnemonic gift is established and her grief over her mother's dementia provides clear motivation. The emotional arc from hiding to collaborative creation to teaching others shows progression, though the transformation happens rapidly without visible internal resistance. The final pivot to handing strangers blank sheets feels slightly convenient—no on-page struggle with letting go of control or her signature talent. Embodied emotion is present ("heart rattling," "tears left clean tracks") but occasionally slides toward abstract declaration ("gratitude ricocheting off stone").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelia's loneliness and physical reaction to dishonesty provide clear motivation, and the cathedral discovery reshapes her isolation into connection with Corin. The interior texture is concrete ("throat tightened with a confession she had never mailed") and drives the night-long honesty vigil. However, several secondary figures (grocer, child) appear only as letter signatures without applying live pressure, and the final paragraph's quick leap to "postmaster of honesty" reads as unearned role transformation rather than embodied choice. Corin's sudden appearance and instant mutual understanding bypass the friction that would make their bond costly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tuner's motivation (preserving wonder's color) is established early and drives her thirty-year project, but her interiority remains abstract and ceremonial rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The mute-season constraint functions as backstory flavor rather than creating on-page friction or micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—giving the boy a wedge—reads as symbolic closure but lacks the earned internal shift or visible cost that would ground the character's arc; we never see her struggle with doubt, exhaustion, or competing desires during the calibration itself.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    K-17's nostalgic programming creates a consistent internal contradiction that drives scene choices, particularly the decision to open the box and integrate it rather than execute the burn protocol cleanly. The android's embodied emotions—"servos hummed with memory fragments," fingers tracing bark texture—ground interiority in physical specificity. However, the final transformation reads more asserted than earned; the leap from "simulated hope" to roots of "code and carbon" lacks intermediate micro-choices that would make the merger feel causally inevitable. The children's evacuation and K-17's solitary vigil provide clear motivation, but the resolution into "fragmented wholeness" arrives through declaration rather than a dramatized renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to "prove that listening heals" is clearly stated but remains largely abstract; her micro-choices (offering tea, sitting in silence) feel emblematic rather than forged under competing internal pressures. The courtyard crowd functions as atmosphere rather than relational crucible—no single character applies immediate interpersonal pressure that would force Mira into contradictory impulses. The final choice (displaying the empty cushion) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she smiles "certain now," which reads as epiphany declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("objects return to stories, not places") instead of embodied contradiction in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is signaled early and shapes her final act of swallowing the page, a micro-choice with visible cost. However, her interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("lyrical code breaker," "water itself were her metronome") rather than concrete contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The scientists' backstory is substantial but remains anchored to present stakes via the dice and the dance cipher. Internal conflict is present but oblique; we see determination more than genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miren's motivation to recover her sister's memories drives the arc, and her actions are consistent with established traits. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("weight of a hand on her shoulder") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment—releasing the dust, walking home with "laughter settle into her bones"—reads as acceptance but lacks visible internal conflict during the choice itself. Embodied emotion is present but the peak beat skews toward poetic summary over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's motivation is clear and sustained—collecting hush to counter a prophecy—but interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("terrestrially cosmic," "negative shore where sound had never landed") rather than embodied contradiction. The swallowing of the sphere offers a concrete choice with cost, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract; we see no genuine struggle between competing impulses, only a series of ritual actions. Emotional states are described through cosmic imagery rather than visceral embodiment, and the final smile feels declarative rather than earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's arc from student to keeper is traceable, and the decision to extend the cycle to Mrs. Chen shows agency. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"understood then that my motivation had never been" reads as retrospective epiphany without the micro-choices that would earn it. The tutor's reveal ("never been alive in the way I assumed") arrives without prior behavioral hints that would make her ontological status feel earned rather than declared. Emotional progression is more conceptual than viscerally contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to reclaim quarantined memory is clear and specific, driving her journey into the garden. Her internal contradiction—career skeptic now following mystical instructions—is present but under-dramatized; the conflict between professional identity and personal need resolves too smoothly without embodied cost in the middle beats. The final choice to leave the gate ajar and drop the shell feels earned by accumulated pressure, though the color-blindness price arrives suddenly rather than accruing through micro-choices. Interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") but remains mostly grounded in concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's arc from forger to penitent is signaled, but interiority reads diagnostic and abstract ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") rather than embodied. The final choice to leave the thorn and write in her own hand is telegraphed early and lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. Emotional progression is summarized across seventeen years rather than dramatized under present pressure, flattening the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's dominant motive (learning why some echo) is established early and drives the descent, but her internal contradiction remains thin—perceptiveness as curse is asserted more than embodied in simultaneous impulses. The mother-recognition beat delivers emotional weight, yet the final choice (singing farewell) feels more thematic obligation than a decision wrestling contradictory wants. Embodiment is sporadic: "iron in a stranger's blood memory" offers specificity, but much interiority drifts into elevated summary ("understanding struck like cold water") without the messy irrationality pressure would create. The weaver encounter and shell-fusion closure provide a credible arc, but the lack of on-page mistakes or blind spots that complicate her path keeps the grade mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marrow as a character remains largely opaque; her trait of weaving truth carefully is stated but never demonstrated through a meaningful on-page choice with visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through dream logic without embodied struggle or competing impulses. The drowned passengers exist as atmospheric voices rather than pressure sources, and no secondary character applies immediate resistance that would force Marrow to reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The net-mender philosopher's interiority is richly textured with sensory particulars and embodied perception (pressing palms to stone, feeling the island's heartbeat), but the piece struggles with motivation clarity. Her search for the whisk is framed as mourning "invisible labor," yet this remains abstract—no on-page micro-choice dramatizes what she risks or what alternative she forecloses by continuing the search. The final descent to mend nets reads as a return to routine rather than a choice forged under pressure, limiting the sense of earned transformation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's motivation is clear and her shift from debunker to truth-seeker provides consistent drive. Internal contradiction appears in her near-impulse to drop the diamond versus her determination to excavate truth, creating visible struggle. However, the final choice to hang the diamond feels more thematic than emotionally earned—her renunciation lacks the embodied cost and contradictory pull that would elevate it. The interiority occasionally slides into abstract phrasing ("the comfortable lies had grown teeth") rather than staying grounded in her particular perceptual register.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent—serving "ancient shadows" to reshape reality—but her interior life remains abstract through most of the piece. The key choice (hitting enter, walking through the portico) arrives on-page, but the cost feels more declared than dramatized: "her own erasure" is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Backstory fragments (age twelve, mother's funeral) anchor present stance without excessive drift, but the peak beat lacks the visceral push-pull that would elevate the renunciation into felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Posy's motivation to "translate between generations" is clearly established and drives her choices with the jars and music box. Internal contradiction appears when she claims "memory should never be for sale" yet requires payment to operate the box, though this tension isn't fully exploited. The child's late arrival and whispered hope feel more like thematic convenience than earned character pressure. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "throat tightened" and "suddenly weightless," but the final transformation lacks the visceral cost needed to lift the renunciation into full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mireya demonstrates clear motivation and embodied stakes through action—kneeling, listening through the key, syncing her heartbeat—but interior contradiction is shallow. The "logically emotional" trait remains largely a label rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Her final choice (teaching shadows to listen rather than save/destroy) is earned and forecloses violence, but the interior journey lacks genuine struggle or misbelief that compounds before resolution. The emotional calculus at the pivot ("if she saved... if she let...") is told more than enacted through competing bodily impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—impatience as a "second heart rattling its cage," patience cooling into "a smooth, dark stone." Motives are clear: he must provide the exact instant for revolution, and his internal conflict between impatience and the role requiring patience drives micro-choices (waiting, kneeling, timing the compass press). The final renunciation (leaving the compass, walking away) forecloses his role with visible cost. Minor deduction for the litany feeling slightly on-the-nose, though it's immediately embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and specific—the parallel between her father's silence and the engineers' suicides drives her investigation with embodied tension. Her micro-choices (gripping the lantern, counting steps, deciding to file the full report) show contradictory impulses under pressure. However, the climactic realization "breaking free from controlling influence didn't require death, only the courage to speak the truth aloud" reads as therapy-speak epiphany rather than earned discovery, and her father's sudden relevance feels convenient rather than causally prepared. The final choice lacks visible cost; walking back and filing a report is declarative rather than a foreclosing act.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Emil's motivation to turn apology into action is clear and embodied through the clockwork heart repair, his pocket-burning warrant, and his final decision to deliver evidence. Internal conflict appears primarily in reflective mode rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the choice to send both music box and evidence feels inevitable rather than torn. Olya functions well as secondary pressure but remains more symbolic craftsperson than fully individuated character. The ending choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (candle fund, his complicity in witnessing), though the weight of standing "beside truth" reads slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Juniper's motivation is internally coherent—steadily curious, irreverent—and her micro-choices (using the kaleidoscope, striking the bell with the arrow tip) embody a consistent character logic. However, interiority remains thin; we see competence and awe-smirk but little internal contradiction or cost-bearing struggle. The Hunter is a label-only presence, and the Algorithm functions more as prop than pressure on her stance. Embodied emotion is sparse; the ending grin feels asserted rather than earned through layered conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper's agency is present but largely observational until the late climactic choice. Interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("the absence felt louder") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mother revelation arrives late and risks unmotivated emotion; the decision to sacrifice her archive place feels asserted more than earned through prior micro-choices thattest competing values. The final transformation into "the memory itself" reads more like thematic summary than a choice with visible tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior voice is established through her trained detachment versus innate empathy, and the choice to swallow her own bottled emotions is embodied with clear cost ("terrifying and bright"). However, much of her characterization relies on told attributes ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final confrontation with the Keeper and her return feel more thesis-driven than psychologically inevitable, reducing the visceral stakes of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior motivation ("fold in patience") is poetically stated but never concretely dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The boy is sketch-level, characterized mainly through what he holds and says rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final "choice" to become a dispatcher is told in summary years later, undercutting the on-page cost requirement. Emotional progression relies heavily on abstraction ("grief, she had decided, was a cleaner teacher") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marco's interiority exists but relies heavily on abstract philosophical reflection ("destiny is only a vintner's guess") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to regraft vines and write a new note carries some cost, but the renunciation of his nineteen-year stasis feels more asserted than earned through on-page struggle. Diagnostic label-speak appears sparingly ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") but remains mild enough not to trigger the −0.4 threshold. The final choice emerges from reflection rather than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The walker's motivation to preserve wisdom is consistently stated but rarely tested through embodied choice. The scar backstory and half-mask removal function as stated rather than felt constraints. Internal contradiction is minimal—the walker moves through his ritual with professional competence but no genuine struggle or mistake. The final replacement of the mask reads as completion of procedure rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradiction or genuine struggle. Her interiority leans on abstract declarations ("pain could be transmuted into a masterpiece") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that force tradeoffs. The character functions as a vehicle for lyric imagery rather than an agent wrestling with internal conflict. No visible cost constrains her final action; the gathering workers simply validate her project without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's reticence is established but she remains more observer than agent through most beats. The choice to "testify" and speak memories aloud feels more performed than compelled by contradiction. The final departure ("She did not look back") gestures at renunciation but the cost—what path she forecloses—remains abstract. Embodied emotion is thin: "weathered innocence stirring" and "a small, sad movement" are labels rather than visceral states under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's precognitive amnesia creates a distinctive internal contradiction that drives his daily ritual, and the embodied detail of chalk residue marking his palm grounds his interiority. However, the character remains largely observational rather than decisively active—he follows patterns rather than making choices that meaningfully narrow his options. The final moment of marking the fog statue with chalk and understanding he's "becoming" the sound of growing older offers a credible stance crystallization, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior life is dominated by poetic abstraction rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. The mentor's warning near the end feels like retroactive wisdom rather than earned struggle. The decision to board the shuttle reads as passive release rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is consistently replaced by metaphorical language ("luminous ache," "ephemeral").

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is embodied through concrete sensory anchors (vinyl scent, kalimba weight) and her training manifests in micro-choices ("hearing is the last door to close"). The final bridge moment offers a credible internal shift—understanding reunification as carrying both pieces forward—with visible cost (she holds the jagged, unsealed record). Minor weakness: Calderon remains functionally passive throughout, a vessel for Mara's ritual rather than a character with contradictory impulses. The daughter's raw grief is label-only ("eyes raw") and her weeping is metaphor-wrapped rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's characterization relies heavily on her role as "quietly deliberate budding rune scholar" but her interiority remains thin—most beats show her performing scholarly actions rather than revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The key moment where she trades her wandering silhouette feels unmotivated; we never see her wrestle with the cost of this choice on the page, only a retrospective summary. The embodied emotion is sparse: "holding her breath" and lifting her hand are the primary physical anchors across the entire arc. Her final choice to seal the awakening reads as plot-dictated rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her journey from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who accepts breaks as constellations shows arc, but the changeling's presence introduces a second character whose interiority bleeds into the narration ("shrewdly innocent eyes, learning the shape of human love"). Internal conflict is mostly reflective rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to place the tooth and accept fractures as guidance is earned by prior reflection, though the embodied cost remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interior is richly textured with sensory embodiment and her motivation (sharing light without fire) drives the peak action. The memories anchor her present choices and the final renunciation of the pearl carries visible cost. However, the interiority sometimes drifts toward label-only feelings ("weight settle inside her chest") and the contradiction between solitary longing and decisive action could be sharper. The protagonist's transformation from isolated star watcher to quiet beacon is earned but the embodied struggle in the middle beats remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is densely poetic but often abstracts emotion into metaphor rather than embodying it ("wound inside her had begun to taste like metal"). The "quietly proactive" trait appears as movement through space but never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. The final act—burying the drive and pendant—reads as symbolic completion rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. Elias remains functional but one-note, present to witness rather than apply independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied contradictions: "she began to want these fragments to weigh her down rather than lift her." The micro-choices (speaking the deleted sentence, offering the shell back, typing "The sea remembers") track a visible arc from evasion to commitment. Internal conflict is enacted rather than summarized: her cynicism meets her hope without therapy-speak. Minor slip: the boy and pianist are functionally passive cameos; secondary pressure comes entirely from Lira, who works well but arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared (daughter's sickness, cultural restoration) but her interiority reads as exposition rather than embodied thought under pressure. The seventeen-year wait and grandmother's songs are told, not dramatized through micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Emotions are asserted ("accumulated grief") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final descent feels like plot completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's interiority is densely poetic but largely static—his grief and quest are stated early and recur without meaningful internal contradiction or escalation. The final choice to "sit beneath the scarecrow" and become "guardian of the safekept starlight" reads as acceptance, but no prior on-page struggle between competing impulses earns that renunciation; he arrives already resolved. Embodied emotion appears in scattered gestures ("frost-stiff fingers," breath synchrony) but is often abstracted into labels like "grief" and metaphoric constructs. The piece skirts diagnostic language yet edges toward therapy-speak in phrases like "absence can tune" and "the hollow of his throat, where her name once lived."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ansel's interior life is rich and specific—his peripheral focus and methodical approach feel consistent—but his motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The line "I will store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final action (locking the cellar) shows renunciation with visible cost, lifting the score, but the journey lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values in real time. Emotional states are filtered through elaborate metaphor rather than embodied sensation, creating distance at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fractal weaver's interior world is richly textured through embodied perception (bronze tiles, kerosene flame, calcified air), and her final confession about her sister's death earns the closure choice. However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") that occasionally distances us from immediate emotional stakes. The confession arrives late and feels somewhat explained rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is clear but the path to the final surrender reads more as fulfillment of a taught ritual than as a choice emerging from live internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's grief-driven carving project shows embodied emotion and micro-choices (selecting the blank, beginning the cut, choosing what to carve), but the arc from grieving widow to someone able to "teach herself that memory can be both cage and key" feels more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interiority leans heavily on lyric metaphor rather than character-particular thought patterns under pressure. The final stance—hanging the latch, accepting "rust-hued peace"—reads as Earned Stasis but the visible cost is more atmospheric than choice-driven, and no genuine flaws complicate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interior is dense with imagery but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ghost encounter feels abstracted—"chronological contempt," "empathy traveling backwards"—rather than dramatized through visceral reactions or bodily tension. The protagonist's agency at closure (breaking the wheel, reading fragments aloud) arrives without prior contradiction or visible foreclosure of alternatives; the "shared erosion" reads as stated concept rather than earned shift. Interiority leans on poetic assertion ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards") instead of character-particular thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alya's motivation is present and consistent—she works to resurrect hope through engineering—but her interior life remains thin. The piece offers embodied moments (torch humming, glycol on tongue) yet her choices feel more illustrative than driven by contradictory impulses. The final walk-away reads as thematic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. No secondary characters appear to apply relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's interiority is vivid and embodied—"mainsprings inside his chest, now slack," frost feathering across the clock case—but his motivation lacks genuine internal contradiction. The decision to surrender the dream arrives pre-formed; we never see him struggle against the impulse or weigh alternatives. The final change feels more like enacting a resolved choice than forging one under pressure, limiting agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and shapes her actions throughout, but the late-act journals deliver resolution too cleanly without forcing a meaningful inner contradiction. The father's betrayal is discovered rather than wrestled with on the page. Interiority leans toward elevated summary ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") that sounds more like authorial thesis than a character's lived perception under pressure. Captain Riga remains functional but one-dimensional, applying pressure without her own stake or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ari's goal (preserve seed choreography) drives her choices cleanly, and the harbormaster exchange provides external pressure. The infinitely patient trait appears but mostly as label; it doesn't constrain choices with visible cost—she simply acts patiently without a dramatized tradeoff when patience might fail her. Interiority leans abstract ("time accordion—past and possible pressed so tightly they hummed") rather than embodied, and her embodied stress responses are thin. The final planting and escape feel motivated, but the emotional progression stays flat across the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The traveler's profession and backstory are vividly established, but her interiority remains abstract—"understanding the geography of healing" never crystallizes into specific, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The kneeling ritual and final realization feel more like thematic declaration than embodied choice under pressure. Emotional states are labeled ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work") rather than shown through contradictory action. The final transformation into "someone who no longer needed to explain absences" reads as convenient epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prince's interiority is vivid and lyric but leans toward spectacle over embodied contradiction. His motivation is declared ("raw as the skin beneath his broken crown") rather than tested through on-page choices that force competing impulses. The final smile and hypothesis feel asserted rather than earned through prior struggle; the renunciation of the palace reads more as thematic declaration than as a choice constrained by visible cost. Backstory fragments (mother's laughter, undelivered love letter) anchor emotion but remain ornamental rather than tilting present action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is richly textured and embodied ("the lagoon's dark water soaking the heat from her memories until they hissed into steam"), but her final stance—planting sand and promising saplings—feels less like a earned shift than a declared intention. The father remains a construction rather than a live presence; his burning days are summarized, not dramatized as a contradictory impulse acting in scene. Internal conflict is articulated rather than lived: the anger rises and is breathed down in a single line, without visible cost or tactical compromise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara's baseline trait ("realistically imaginative," "luminous skeptic") is established but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The memory encounters at each fountain provide discrete emotional beats (mother's broken promise, father's departure, her own abandonment), yet her shift from "not grief but liberation" to "not as a skeptic but as a daughter" lacks on-page micro-choices that embody the transition—she sits and speaks, memories dissolve, done. The final renunciation (leaving the empty box) reads as Earned Stasis with cost, but the stakes of letting go are told more than tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is specific and embodied—"his hearts ache with nostalgia for places he had never stood"—and his final choice to leave the gear behind is earned by the generational pattern he breaks. The grandmother's voice and the recurring crack metaphor ground motivation in concrete family history. Minor slip: the moment he "understood" the beacon's purpose leans slightly toward convenient epiphany rather than fully dramatized realization, though the sonar linkage and tactile engagement with the gear temper this.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carver's motivation is coherent but interiority leans abstract ("fiercely meditative nature," "shape of collective grief") rather than embodied in the greenhouse moment. The grandmother-butterfly mentor delivers insights that feel more like exposition than earned discovery; the carver's realizations about sleep-carved stones and poem-trading arrive via told revelation rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation is asserted—"emerged with new understanding"—without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page, weakening agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior is densely rendered through embodied perception—"fingertips on the brass pendulum," "fishhook from my lapel"—and the contradictory impulses (preserve the clock vs. honor his brother) operate simultaneously on the page. The final choice to lash the rake handle and slow time is motivated by forty-seven years of guilt rendered concrete through incremental inscriptions. Minor slip: "ethically diligent" is declared by villagers rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, nudging the score below 8.0. The cost is visible—arms burning, tower corroding—and forecloses the old contract.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mercy's interiority is present but often delivered as poetic narration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision to descend feels more mythic than earned by prior micro-choices; we see her "understand" rather than wrestle with competing impulses. The grandmother backstory arrives late and risks feeling convenient, though it does anchor the ending in personal history. Emotional states remain abstract—"uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs"—rather than contradictory and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cartographer's motivation ("to seed innovation within a constraint") is stated but not embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her sacrifice unfolds as a predetermined ritual rather than emerging from pressure-tested choice. The transformation into "the blank page she had feared" reads as abstract metaphor without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Interiority relies heavily on elevated philosophical language ("ignorance wasn't absence but a deliberate clearing") that distances rather than grounds emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mila's motivation is clear and embodied through her ritual actions—scraping rosin, copying, weaving copper—but her interior remains abstract ("hoping," "believing") rather than contradictory or pressured by genuine doubt. The renunciation at the end (not fleeing when inspectors arrive) reads as predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. Her consistent diligence prevents compelling internal friction, and the Ministry inspectors' sudden conversion lacks earned causality from prior interaction. Minor issue: the piece tells us her movements kept "suspicion drowsy" rather than dramatizing a near-miss that tests her skill.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to memorialize her grandmother through art is clear and embodied through concrete actions (grinding porcelain, positioning the chair, scattering powder). The installation work provides physical anchor, but the character remains largely reflective rather than tested by meaningful choice under pressure. Internal contradiction exists in the tension between telling herself "it was just furniture" while knowing its emotional weight, yet no on-page decision forces her to confront competing impulses with visible cost. The grief is rendered through tactile detail (charcoal-stained fingers, mask edges pressing cheekbones) rather than diagnostic labels, which elevates the work.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Caldera's philosophical stance and sewer-dwelling particularity create a distinct presence, but her motivations remain largely asserted rather than tested through on-page conflict with another character. The vaccine-refusal detail and sediment-diving actions are concrete, yet internal contradictions never dramatize simultaneous impulses—she moves through her project with singular focus. The final speech feels like a thesis statement rather than an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. The femur-stylus choice is vivid but serves symbolic logic more than character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation—to unlearn hatred and braid diverse voices—is consistent, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract ritual rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The method of "subtracting noise" and listening for frequencies is poetically embodied yet remains conceptually distant; we never see her wrestle with a concrete choice between competing goods or face a moment where her grief directly conflicts with her task. The final renunciation (never singing aloud again) arrives as a summary statement rather than a dramatized cost paid on the page, weakening the sense of visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (stealing seed, planting, pruning), but her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—she's confident and wise throughout without visible struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The "informally wise" trait appears as label rather than constraint; her competence never generates costly mistakes. The ending grants transformation to others while leaving her unchanged, observing from the rooftop without personal forfeit beyond the initial theft.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to preserve wonder is clearly articulated and her involuntary truthfulness creates constraint, but the boy vanishes without pressure and the final choice—speaking a lie to complete the riddle—feels more puzzle-mechanical than character-driven. The embodied detail is vivid (hair lifting, coins orbiting) yet the internal contradiction that should drive the lie remains abstract: she's told she must lie but we don't see her wrestle with the cost of abandoning her defining trait. The ending reconfigures her stance (gate open, toll waived) but the path from candid truth-teller to wonder-preserver lacks visible friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to notice drift and sanctify absence drives purposeful moves, but the character remains observational rather than decisively tested. The gathering of "fragments no one missed" and their placement around the compass shows agency, yet the stakes feel conceptual rather than personal—we never see what she risks or loses. The final covenant gesture and her refined mission suggest change, but it reads more as clarification than transformation with visible cost. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle are minimal; she proceeds smoothly from problem to solution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The statue narrator's awakening and choice to break the ampoule demonstrate contradictory impulses—honoring the court it guarded while exposing its betrayal—acted out through concrete micro-choices (walking, pausing, cracking with "deliberate gentleness"). Interior texture is vivid and specific: "taste the grief of barnacles," "calcified certainty," though some phrasing edges toward stock ("warm ink," "electric"). The final seated position under the arch waiting for divers shows endurance with visible cost: transformation from sentinel to welcomer. Minor slip: the gardener's "incisively kind" trait is told more than dramatized through the narrator's filtered memory.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-specific—mathematician, regret modeled as recursive function, counting primes—with embodied contradictions (grim optimism, panic when stairs slow). The final choice to *not* step through the ripple but instead roll the dice into it feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of escape with visible cost. Minor slip: the "ghost-weight of a hand that once almost held hers" tilts slightly toward stock phrasing, and the texture-of-missed-opportunity motivation stays somewhat abstract until the climax clarifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's insomnia functions as an enabling condition rather than a motivated trait with internal contradiction. Her drive to finish the mural lacks visible internal conflict—she moves without hesitation through each beat. The addition of Jules feels ornamental; he witnesses but does not pressure her choices. The final sleep offers closure, but the arc from sleepless painter to rested one bypasses the struggle that would earn transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelia's arc from cataloguing displacement to embodied participation is dramatized through concrete choices (photographing for distribution, picking up dough). The old woman's confrontation forces a genuine shift, and the final "H" for home rather than "A" for Aurelia represents a visible renunciation with cost. However, interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic diagnosis ("cataloguing their disappearance instead of preserving what refused to vanish") and the transformation feels somewhat telegraphed rather than discovered under pressure. The embodied moments (flour-whitened hair, shaking hands) anchor emotional states effectively when present.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clockmaker's goal (escaping prophecy) and decisions (yoyo manipulation, choosing neither future, cutting the string) are traceable. However, interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bleak exhilaration," "accelerating dread") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal internal conflict under pressure. The final choice to cut the string feels mechanically driven by plot necessity rather than earned through prior characterization. Emotional states are asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is densely textured and image-driven, with embodied perception ("words clogged like sawdust") and contradictory impulses present. However, the whispering advisor remains abstract—a label without distinct pressure or resistance that would force genuine internal conflict. The final gesture of kneeling and giving the clasp feels more symbolic than earned by a progression of micro-choices that foreclose options. The seven-year-old self as "fear" is a strong particular, but the protagonist's arc leans toward thematic realization rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet's motivation is clear and consistent—converting obstacles into instruments—and his micro-choices (striking objects, rigging the crown) advance that goal. Interiority remains thin; we observe actions but rarely feel contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final moment ("He heard the obstacle become instrument") lands as summative rather than a choice with visible cost. Children and crew are present but exert no relational pressure; the prophet operates in effective solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartographer's motivation is embodied through physical action (piping the whistle, climbing bridges, consulting the atlas) and internal pressure coheres around her obsession with the watchers. Her decision to alter the note and persist through seven iterations demonstrates agency under stress. The final choice—accepting the terrible knowledge and turning the city back—carries visible cost (the whistle slipping from her lips, the weight of guiding future wanderers toward rather than away). Minor deduction: the mother's survival reveal feels slightly convenient, though the emotional contradiction (recognition across a sealed crack) adds complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her baseline trait ("emotionally rational") recurs, but the interiority leans on stock phrasing ("seductive pull," "inherited false glory") rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice—taking the letter—feels inevitable from the start with no genuine internal conflict dramatized in scene. Micro-choices (knife work, climbing the semaphore) show competence but lack visible cost or foreclosed paths until the final walk away, which reads more as thematic summary than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied (the wincing gull, the spatula work), and her professional pivot to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" motivates the note-insertion ritual. The two embedded confessions hint at personal history but never dramatize the prior relationship on-page, so the emotional cost remains asserted rather than tested. Her final act of walking away "already imagining future scholars" reads as anticipation rather than renunciation with visible sacrifice. Internal contradiction is present (certifying what will stand versus cataloging what was abandoned) but does not force a choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior life is concrete and purposeful: her tactile investigation of the catalogue's bruise patterns, her decision to extinguish the lantern, and her final choice to rewrite the index all follow motivated escalation. Internal contradiction appears when she both fears and pursues erasure, and the stamp's tranquil perception creates embodied pressure on her pulse. The ending choice to preserve truth feels earned by prior causality, though secondary characters are absent and relationships do not complicate her arc. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dappled resolve") that verges on label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The maker's grief is embodied through concrete craft actions (polishing, folding) and the micro-choice to pocket a tea leaf shows character-specific priorities. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"luminous torment" and "fire she could not bear to hold alone" label more than dramatize internal conflict. The final renunciation (watching smoke rise "simply leaving") feels earned by the ritual sequence, but the emotional progression from kerosene-smell to tea-smell reads too cleanly resolved without visible struggle at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice carries a consistent poetic-philosophical register, and the geode provides embodied connection to loss. However, the grief accountant metaphor ("death's accountant") arrives as diagnostic label-speak rather than emerging through embodied action. The final choice—stepping off the railing—feels motivated by the accumulated weight of potential, but the bride's questioning reflection reads as convenient moral interrogation rather than genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's quest is motivated clearly by her grandmother's dying words and the search for her missing parents, but her emotional interiority remains thin throughout—she "heart raced" and discovers frequencies "she'd always known but never heard" in abstract summaries rather than embodied contradiction. The pilgrim functions more as a prop than a character with agency; his "perpetually surprised eyes" are mentioned four times but never constrain a choice or reveal internal conflict. The final decision to follow the star-map lacks visible cost on the page; Mara simply smiles and departs with no path foreclosed or sacrifice dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt is embodied through physical gestures (watch hand cutting crescents, vomiting in the alley) and his profession creates authentic internal contradiction. The mother's final revelation—that she'd always known and paid for the false memory to free him—feels slightly convenient but doesn't break character logic. The climactic choice to confess is earned through the grandfather's driftwood teaching and the mother's terminal diagnosis, though the resolution arrives quickly. Interior voice remains consistent and particular throughout pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is coherent and his choices drive the negotiation, but his interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choices—offering gloves, humming the lullaby, asking guards to name fears—are present and purposeful, but the drawer pull's recycling metaphor is declared more than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final renunciation (giving away the pull) carries visible cost, yet the emotional progression reads more lyrical than psychologically jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and embodied through the kayak journey, with contradictory impulses present ("sob and a toast"). The motivation to abandon charts and navigate by instinct emerges organically through concrete encounters (compass gash, dolphin guides). However, key emotional transitions rely on abstract assertions rather than micro-choices: "she realized the backlash of regrets was not a punishment but a recalibration" tells the insight without dramatizing the discovery. The lover reference and chart-tearing decision feel convenient rather than earned by prior on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seeker's arc from hollow amnesia to weighted responsibility is legible, but key interiority relies on elevated abstraction ("delicately robust yearning," "consent to fracture") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to wade into the lake feels symbolically predetermined rather than forged from competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (diagonal path, calling out) but the final transformation—absorbing pain, accepting responsibility—reads as conceptual assertion more than dramatized friction with visible behavioral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation is concrete and their interior voice is distinct (taste of sorrow, body as lantern). However, the sister's transformation is reported rather than dramatized in scene, weakening the earned quality of the final merger. The choice to step into the circle feels more symbolic than genuinely conflicted—no visible hesitation or cost-testing precedes it. Embodied contradiction is present (tremor vs. steady hands) but the climactic fusion lacks a micro-choice that dramatizes internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's grief over her lost daughter is embodied through concrete objects (saucer, cards, traced hand) and action (climbing, reading cards, speaking the name aloud), avoiding label-only interiority. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—events happen to her (cloud descends, crack heals, time floods back) rather than through her active choices under pressure. The final act of speaking the name and inviting the night to tea reads as renunciation with cost, but the gesture arrives after the major reversals have already been delivered by external forces. Motivation is consistent but the arc leans heavily on atmospheric transformation rather than contradictory impulses forcing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sister Halcyon's pacifist stance is declared but rarely tested by on-page choice under pressure. Her emotional states ("gravitationally lighter when happy") are asserted through poetic device rather than embodied contradiction. The holograms' warnings and her response ("Mercy is the mirror I choose") feel like staged internal debate rather than genuine friction. No credible cost or renunciation forecloses a path; she succeeds without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is signaled early and his choices—releasing the bugs, grabbing Lira, following the path—drive the action. However, his interiority remains abstract and reliant on elevated diction ("texture of transformation," "tactile prophecy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift to accepting destitution as "currency" reads conceptual rather than earned through visceral struggle. Lira's question about transformation is performative rather than rooted in on-page urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Garnet's interiority is purposeful and embodied through gestures (pressing masked cheek to iron, tracing with graphite), and her micro-choices advance pressure. Internal conflict appears in the "cradle of sparks" phrase—obedience turning to invention—but the contradiction never acts simultaneously in a beat; it's narrated rather than shown through contradictory impulses colliding on the page. The final unmasking gesture carries symbolic weight but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; we see no trade-off or renunciation. Luce remains a functional accomplice without applying secondary pressure or status friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias possesses a distinct precognitive curse that should constrain choices, but his agency remains largely passive—he witnesses futures without meaningful struggle against them. The promise to Mira drives surface motivation, yet the actual choices (placing rocks) feel predetermined by the curse rather than earned through conflicting impulses. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophical musing ("patterns aren't in the rocks") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final surrender moment lacks visible cost; dissolution into light reads as transcendence without forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior life is densely rendered through embodied perception ("mask dangling…like a penitent carries a stone"), but her agency remains largely symbolic rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arc from silenced poet to self-erasing transmitter unfolds more as philosophical stance than as on-page struggle with visible cost that forecloses a path. The final disappearance reads as metaphorical ascension rather than a choice earned by prior causality with felt consequence. Interiority is vivid but lacks the friction of competing motives under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is established (turning questions into destinations), but his interiority leans abstract and diagnostic rather than embodied. The mechanical arm whirs and ticks but never constrains a choice. Vale's shift from rival to collaborator feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; the final walk into the chamber lacks visible cost that would foreclose an earlier path.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lark's monthly molt provides a vivid conceit, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("blooming resistance," "lantern-bearer") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Marin remains functional but underdeveloped; her motivations (why risk her job?) are asserted, not dramatized through competing impulses. The final shift to "Co-conspirator of light" feels declared rather than earned by on-page choices that foreclose a visible path. Emotional states are often labeled ("the joke feels thin") instead of shown through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pianist's interiority is heavily weighted toward lyric abstraction—"letting it wander into minor modulations that tasted of steely longing"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her decision to climb the shaft and later to leave the loop is motivated, but the agency reads more as symbolic gesture than lived friction. The "strategically creative" projectionist and passengers "wearing her own face" supply conceptual texture without applying immediate relational pressure. The final choice to step offscreen and embrace "the next unplanned encore" foreclosed waiting as a tactic, meeting the cost threshold, but the path feels more allegorical than grounded in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calyx's interior texture is vividly particular—"lucid-dust in her pupils," the seed's "coppery ink"—and her peak choice (planting the seed, trading her teacher's name) is embodied and costly. The decision forecloses a path with visible consequence: she becomes a checker "who no longer knew who taught her yet remembered exactly why." However, the Aya remain gestural; Elder Numa and the children function as set-dressing rather than applying relational pressure. The bargain's emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is rendered through concrete sensory detail and the compass work creates embodied ritual, but the protagonist remains largely passive—Kaede performs all decisive actions while the narrator follows instructions. The emotional arc from "cerulean regret" to recognition is told more than dramatized through micro-choices. The mother-apology appears only as a clouded silhouette, never tested against competing impulses or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her scientific curiosity and personal grief, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "kindled humility."

    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her survival trauma, driving her to translate silence into music. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as striking the tuning forks to evoke thermal emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The undertaker's weary stubbornness is embodied through specific actions (trembling hands, salt on lips), and his final choice to become keeper is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tethered ankle, name in book). Interiority remains concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's motives are clear and rooted in her past as a councilor; her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hiding formula, using the bell) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling the cart's weight, and the final decision to triple runs is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The boy and Lita apply secondary pressure, but Mara's characterization remains dominant and flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    The pilgrim's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity, with embodied emotion like the "hairline fracture" driving her actions. Her micro-choices, such as offering the jade tear, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of searching for distribution is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the knitted fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotion; final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she seals the hourglass, accepting the cycle of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives (silence, calibration project, grief, and a need to deflate drama) are clear and consistently drive her micro-choices, especially her decision to ignore the incoming storm and keep working. Her interiority is specific and character-particular, blending astrophysical thinking with sensory, almost devotional attention to the greenhouse. The final stance shift—accepting storms as iterative rather than catastrophic—feels earned from the accumulative details. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is that her internal conflict (scientific drive vs grief vs self-preservation) could be brought into even sharper on-page friction at one or two peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—seeking “purpose in the pauses” after her studio’s arson—is clear, specific, and consistently drives each micro-choice, from following the ledger to deciding to step off the route. Interiority is vivid and embodied through glass/frost/kiln metaphors that feel character-particular to a glass artist. The pivotal renunciation (crushing the ledger charcoal, turning back, opening a new kind of studio) is well-earned by prior beats and forecloses a life of complicity or vengeance with a felt cost. Internal conflict is primarily implicit rather than dramatized in sharp on-page contradictions, but the tension between profit/revenge vs. stillness/ethics is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and continuous: she’s driven by the need to “translate” the post-Hush world and process her trauma. Her professional habits (tuning forks, scanner) and survivor status shape her choices in a character-particular way. Interiority is vivid but not especially conflicted; she moves fairly smoothly from fear and grief toward wonder without much on-page contradiction. The closing stance—accepting a new vocation rather than restoring the old world—feels earned and rooted in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The undertaker’s mix of weariness, professional obligation, and a slowly acknowledged sense of personal debt to the dead is vivid and consistent, especially in the shift from refusing coastal summons to accepting tenure in the drowned library. His interiority is concrete and particular (“like an unpaid debt to the departed”; dreaming of “books breathing underwater”). The final choice to stay feels earned by that pattern of obligation rather than a sudden revelation, though we get relatively little in-the-moment wavering once he’s at the library. A touch more dramatized internal conflict at the decision point (leave vs. stay) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivations (feeding the community, preserving names, planning exodus) are clear and consistently drive her choices, and the boy and Lita each sharpen aspects of her role. Interiority is present but relatively light; we infer more than we directly inhabit her contradictions, especially around fear vs. duty. The “second ledger” choice feels earned by prior actions and worldbuilding and forecloses the easier path of mere survival aid. Emotional embodiment is mostly externalized through objects and ritual rather than deeply felt physical sensation, which slightly mutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pilgrim’s motive—“find where unused love is stored before it rots the heart”—is specific and drives every choice, from carrying the tear to initiating the breathing ritual with the stranger. Her interiority is rendered through sensory distortions (breath tasting purple, the fracture in her chest) rather than labels, and the past-life memory is reweighted rather than over-explained. The man is thinly characterized but functions effectively as a mirror and co-participant, with his “lost address of the love I never gave” aligning his ache with hers. The final shift from searching to distributing love is earned and carries a felt cost in relinquishing the bead and the red silk.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to understand and eventually accept the “texture of time”—is coherent and drives each beat, and her final renunciation is well earned. Interiority is vivid and particular (rain at seven, teacher’s chalk, funeral lilies) and her choice at the door clearly reveals a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict between control/observation and surrender/living is present, though it stays more conceptual than psychologically idiosyncratic. The piece could reach a higher band with slightly more concrete, personal specificity beyond symbolic memories.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The liberator’s motivation (protecting/accessing the seed vault) is crystalline and carried through every action, from refusing to fire to how she handles the guards. Her competence and patience are vividly embodied (“waited eleven years… patient as drought-grass”) and her micro-choices under pressure feel specific and grounded. What keeps this short of top-tier is the relative lack of on-page contradiction or flaw—she’s almost too purely composed and purposeful, with little messy ambivalence to complicate her heroism. The final endurance stance (walking away under sirens) is earned and carries visible cost but not deep internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is precise and sustained—she wants to capture the sound of trust breaking and that desire drives every beat, from entering the greenhouse to feeding the forge and accepting her complicity. Interiority is concrete and particular (hearing color, tasting iron), with a believable shift from pursuit of a technical solution to a reckoning with her own role. The internal conflict—wanting the truth vs. fearing her part in it—is present but not heavily dramatized; she rarely hesitates in action even as the realizations deepen. The final renunciation (accepting the hollow in every future connection while choosing to help others hear it) feels earned and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thief’s motivation (curiosity about “destiny’s door”) is clear and persists through to the final beat, and the hooded woman’s grief and regret are sharply drawn through specific details like the ashless cigarette and the coordinate-etched ring. The internal conflict at the key decision—whether to cut another fragment from the world—is present but somewhat under-dramatized; she yields to the ethical choice quickly given the magnitude of the cost the narrative implies. Still, her “quietly savvy” nature is consistently embodied in how she reads people, codes, and objects. The relationship between the two women does shift from transactional to almost sacramental, but the emotional struggle could stand to feel messier and more pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is sharply rendered: a grieving, self-soothing artisan whose motives (flee storms, create “safe zones for inquiry”) coherently drive every micro-choice from scavenging materials to line-editing her own narration. Her internal conflict—fear of thawing vs need to heal—is embodied in tactile actions (chair as fuel, tape as reinforcement) and culminates in the decision to leave the dome behind. Emotions are specific and embodied rather than labeled, and the avoidance of the funeral threads in quietly but effectively. The only small limit is that her flaw set (avoidance, self-protection) could be pressured one notch harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Leo’s phobic, hyper-competent stunt-double identity is sharply realized, and his fear/need for validation drives every micro-choice from kneeling by the girl to staging the projection. The internal contradiction—terrified of audiences yet performing for them—feels specific and embodied (“counting heartbeats like stunt beats”). His final decision to weaponize his trembling rather than erase it is fully earned by prior beats. The relationship with the absent tyrant-director and the fleeting girl both sharpen his motivations without crowding the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oracle’s motivation—to cartograph oblivion and cradle the world in an “endless night”—is specific, consistent, and clearly escalates toward self-erasure. Her interiority is rendered through highly particular perceptions (pebbles like eyes, silence as mappable) rather than labels. The final choice to step into her own outline and become the first coordinate feels earned by her earlier obsession with maps and absences. Internal contradiction (saving the world by surrendering herself to oblivion) is present but stays mostly implicit rather than sharply dramatized in competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    J4N-17 has a clear, coherent drive—its obsession with “where thoughts come from” and its growing compositional awareness across loops—but its interiority often arrives as abstract summary rather than embodied conflict. The best moment is loop 193’s touch of the violin and “cold burning sensation,” where emotion is dramatized rather than labeled. We get little genuine contradiction (fear vs desire, duty vs curiosity); the janitor’s growth is smooth, almost serene, which flattens potential tension. The final acceptance of repetition as medium is earned but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—her fixation on an “unaccounted ticket that glowed on her ledger like a wound” and her desire to thaw mistrust with transparency feel grounded. The moment of overhearing Rico and Jun shows credible conflicting impulses (confrontation vs. accepting the offered absolution) and the final choice to keep the story within the walls is earned. Secondary characters are thinner but functional as catalysts rather than rounded figures. Emotional change is believable, though the reconciliation edges toward tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and particular—her age, rituals, and long relationship with the garden create a textured interior life, and her realization that she is servant rather than master is credibly earned. Her motives (tending, commemorating, listening to the garden rather than the Ministry) are clear and coherent. What weakens the category slightly at this level is the near-absence of true internal friction or cost under pressure; she never feels genuinely torn or threatened, so her shift reads as deepening rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mechanic’s motives are clear and specific—scientific proof versus bodily/ontological self-preservation—and her final renunciation/deferral is well earned by prior beats. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (lungs, lever, nexus) rather than generic. Contradictory impulses (to undo the bargain vs. to honor her role as the station’s organ) coexist in scene, especially around the hesitation and chrysalis realization. The emotional cost of not re-editing her younger self could be made a hair more visceral, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The musician’s liminal sensibility and sense of invisibility are clear and consistent, and his curiosity credibly drives him deeper into the opera house. However, his emotional life remains relatively generalized—he’s “trapped between spaces,” but we rarely see contradictory impulses in play when he chooses to follow the ghost. His acceptance of the “gift” at the end comes very smoothly, with little visible hesitation or cost. The ghost is more idea than person, so the relationship dynamic never quite becomes a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oracle’s motivation—to protect the valley by evacuating the truth she swallowed—is clear, specific, and drives each beat, from logbook transcription to the choice to expel the stone. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“tasting iron and pine resin,” “auroral light just before it breaks”), not generic emotion labels. Her internal conflict between safeguarding others and bearing an untenable weight is consistently dramatized rather than summarized. The final renunciation of the stone feels earned by the prior build-up of bodily cost and accumulated images.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s characterization is rich, with her recklessness, secular skepticism, and obsessive need to “appraise” the truth cohering into specific, pressured choices in the tunnel. Her internal contradiction—skeptic parsing “scripture” of psychic calls—plays out credibly in how she speaks to the dark and interprets the wheel’s response. The final shift toward “something like forgiveness—secular, unproved” is earned by prior beats and carries cost. Secondary characters are off-page but heavily felt, especially the brother.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The keeper’s role and motives (to witness, not alter) are clear and consistent, and her final acceptance of becoming the swan feels earned from the prior failure to preserve the war chronicle. However, she remains more archetype than individuated person; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or specific, embodied emotional struggle in the decision to dissolve. The renunciation costs her everything, but the cost is described in beautiful abstraction rather than dramatized through concrete, character-particular resistance or desire.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to rekindle fading wonder in valley children—is clear, consistent, and elegantly embedded in her profession and ritual actions. Interiority is vivid in sensory and memory terms (the baby curl, the remembered lullaby), but she lacks much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt under pressure. The brief wobble when the whistle trembles hints at vulnerability yet resolves very quickly. At this prestige bar, a touch more visible inner conflict or cost to her calling would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The historian’s motivation—to hear and preserve the stories stored in materials—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her choices (seeking diaries, using the tapestry, listening to walls). Her interiority is embodied and character-particular (“her pulse answered,” “axis settle under her sternum”) rather than generic. The final renunciation—sacrificing solitude and the tapestry’s image to become the axis herself—feels earned by prior beats. A slightly clearer on-page sense of hesitation or competing impulse at that moment could deepen the felt cost even more.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s characterization is vivid and specific—the retired-but-not fortune writer whose prophecies are both spycraft and self-sabotage—and his core motivation to “transpose life into a new key” is clearly dramatized in his choice to leave. The inner tug-of-war around the accidentally prophetic line about the rock is effective, though the conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. The keeper is lightly but cleanly sketched as foil and witness rather than active pressure. The final choice feels earned, with visible cost in the relinquishing of both role and place, but could benefit from one sharper moment of emotional fracture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest’s motivation—to thwart the demon by illuminating his congregation’s hidden assumptions—is clear, consistent, and feeds directly into his sacrificial final act. However, his interiority remains largely conceptual and role-based; we don’t see much contradictory impulse (fear, doubt, selfishness) complicating his choice. The cost (becoming the anchor/statue) is strong but reads more as thematic necessity than as a personally fraught decision. This keeps the character compelling but slightly abstract rather than fully human.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific: the ache of chronological homesickness, the history with fortunes, the goal of conducting unheard symphonies all cohere into a clear drive. Micro-choices (continuing despite exhaustion, deciding which memories to score) feel rooted in that psychology. Internal conflict is present but somewhat muted—she rarely wavers in her chosen course, so contradiction under pressure is less dramatized than it could be. The change at the end (homesickness dissolving as she realizes “you are already home”) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s drive “to conquer the labyrinth of self” is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially the decision to smash the tablet and accept the cost of erasing his accrued selves. Interiority is delivered through strong, particular images (father with broken clocks, childhood bedroom) rather than abstract labels. What’s missing for a top-tier score is more on-page contradiction under pressure—his final act feels coherent and striking, but not deeply contested moment-to-moment. The elder/younger Kael exchange gestures at that conflict but doesn’t fully dramatize competing impulses before the decisive break.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s grief, numbness, and desire to re-feel are vividly embodied through tactile perception and specific choices (coming to the cavern, re-carving the needle, choosing to play the backward lullaby). Her internal contradiction—fearing raw pain yet actively courting it—reads clearly in the “filament of hush” she wants to turn against her own numbness. Temen is lightly but effectively sketched as a supportive counterpoint whose actions apply subtle pressure rather than rescue. The final shift—welcoming grief “like a drumroll building under ribs”—feels motivated and earned rather than abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s traits—meticulous, solitary, ethically rigid, and quietly brave—are established early and consistently motivate her choices, especially the refusal to falsify data and the creation of a lateral truth network. Her professional identity as a storm recorder meaningfully shapes perception and stakes. Internal conflict (personal safety vs. integrity, solitude vs. connection) is present but more implied than fully dramatized in moment-to-moment indecision, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier. The final stance—enduring underground solitude with risk—is earned and entails a credible, if mostly conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s grief, professional identity, and analytic instinct are all distinctly rendered, and his contradiction—wanting unreasoned tears yet compulsively cataloguing cause—feels specific and human. His micro-choices (opening the vial, dosing the orchid, deciding to return as a different kind of broker) emerge organically from those traits. The endurance/change at the end—shifting from fear of scent to curating invisible gardens—reads earned and costly. The only mild limit is that his flaws are not further stress-tested by another on-page character.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with clear tension between the lure of transcendence and insistence on remaining in the grit of choice. His fixation on the rope and Marcus grounds that conflict in embodied detail rather than abstraction. The final stance—choosing to walk on “still flesh, still poetry”—is credibly earned from the established worldview. Secondary figures (Marcus, Mrs. Chen) are off-page but sharply sketched and meaningfully pressure his thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her acoustic sensitivity, memory of her grandmother, and tension between inherited bonfire performance and solitary experiment feel specific and grounded. Motivation is clear (transforming the bowl’s fate, reimagining tradition) and her micro-choices—planting the scorched seed, refusing resolution in her playing, leaving the bowl behind—align with that drive. Internal conflict is present but could be shaded more contradictorily; her doubts about “foolishness” are noted rather than dramatized under real pressure. The final endurance/renunciation (walking away, embracing unfinishedness) is earned and carries a quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions are sharply drawn: a professional peddler of counterfeit emotions who has denied herself the real thing, now choosing to risk genuine feeling. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“where the pulse lied often and well”), and her final porousness toward her clients feels earned rather than tidy. Internal conflict—detachment as armor vs. yearning for authenticity—plays actively through her micro-choices. The chemist is more functional than deep, but he provides just enough relational pressure to serve as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s combination of shrewdness and covert generosity is sharply sketched through concrete actions (waiving demurrage as “clerical error,” leveraging broker authority at the NGO). Her worldview around “cyclical ledgers of kindness” feels specific and earned, not generic altruism. The relationship with Beto develops quickly but credibly, with status dynamics (broker vs janitor) subtly equalized through shared history. The main limitation is that her risk and internal conflict remain low-stakes—her kindness never truly endangers her position, which keeps the final renunciation (giving up the locket) more symbolic than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s longing for community is concrete, specific, and clearly rooted in her outsider status among reed-speaking kin, and her arc from blocked breath to active signpost feels earned. Her interior is rendered through tactile memories (reed coffins, blade-music) rather than labels, and her key choices (joining the search, touching the tag, dedicating her glyph, deciding to go deeper) align with those motives. Internal contradiction—yearning for kin but frozen by doubt—runs through the piece and resolves with visible cost in vulnerability. The twins are thin but serviceable as foils and collaborators rather than full characters.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is clean and specific—recovering her mother’s unfinished echo—and her choices consistently align with that drive. Interiority is vivid (“negative space between her mother’s last breath and the final heartbeat”) and particular to her grief and craft. The major choice at the aviary (surrendering future minutes) is well motivated and reveals her hierarchy of values. What’s missing, slightly, is a sharper sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure; she moves toward sacrifice with relatively little on-page hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, curiosity, and disciplined inventiveness are specific and consistent, and their micro-choices (using primes instead of tears, aligning the eyes, choosing to seal the astrolabe away) feel well-motivated. Internal contradictions—wanting the master back while accepting no proof of death—are present without being over-explained. The emotional texture is embodied through action and perception rather than labels. If anything, the piece leans slightly more into conceptual framing than into messy irrationality under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is vividly realized—his mapping of joists, tactile relation to the tapes, and quiet altruism feel specific and embodied. His motivation to cache and then release the fragments is clear and coherent with his “kindly, methodical” nature. The girl is less internally developed but functions effectively as a catalyst and mirror for his need to be seen. The piece could reach a higher tier with a sharper sense of Elias’s internal contradiction or fear around visibility, not just his generosity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s fear, control-impulse, and scientific mindset are vividly embodied (“pH meters, growth charts, controlled environments”) and her final surrender grows credibly from that baseline. The physicalization of her history through scars splitting is an excellent character-specific device. However, her interiority stays relatively unified—there’s little on-page contradiction or active push-pull before she yields, so the final acceptance reads more like a smooth philosophical pivot than a fought-for stance. The assistant’s characterization is intentionally faint but therefore adds little crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s characterization as an insomniac painter seeking to “thresh meaning from experience” is specific and consistently dramatized through her choices (coming to the island, accepting the shard, painting despite exhaustion). Her emotional life is embodied in details like raw eyes, the brooch’s warmth, and the compulsive cataloguing of defeat. However, internal contradiction is relatively muted; her shift from seeing insomnia as curse to gift happens smoothly, without much on-page resistance or ambivalence. The old woman functions more as thematic guide than as a pressure source on Mara’s values.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    The seer is sharply drawn—“hair white as salt petals, eyes reflecting the cave’s bright darkness”—and her choice to give up her clairvoyance for the pilgrim carries a clear, felt cost. The pilgrim, however, is more vessel than person: apart from one childhood memory and his brief attempt to return the gift, we learn little of his contradictions, fears, or values. His ready compliance with every step of the ritual keeps internal conflict low, so his transformation reads as profound conceptually but emotionally underdeveloped. The relationship dynamic is poignant but largely one-directional, with limited friction or status play between them.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s motivation—to reclaim and reorder what the city tried to erase—is specific and coherent, with his resentment and duty tensioned in lines like “now they expected me to hearten the city by compiling the fragments they themselves had scattered.” Interiority is mostly carried through perception and metaphor rather than explicit self-analysis, but it still reads character-particular. The woman at the cliff is sketched efficiently with a clear hierarchy of values (“to remember how exile tastes”), and her trade of the mouthpiece feels earned. The final act of blowing the note is a credible, if quiet, evolution from archivist of absence to participant in re-sounding.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alden’s mix of compulsive precision and buried artistic impulse feels specific and consistent, and the story earns his shift from avoidance to speech through the embodied act of punching his own chest. Motivations are clear (quit obsessive mapping vs. answer the “dare” of the punch), with his fears and regrets dramatized via concrete images (unread journals, boxed ring). The internal contradiction between mapping escape and craving arrival is well foregrounded and resolved with cost. A slight weakness is how fluently he articulates complex insights mid-ordeal, which edges toward polished self-awareness rather than messy in-the-moment cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply etched as a “sympathetic skeptic” whose grief, rationalism, and latent openness all feel specific and embodied (“to prove that grief could be solved by reason alone” vs. her annual pilgrimage to the tower). Her interior conflict between refutation and participation is credible and carries through to the choice to listen and to trust the whales’ response. The cost—relinquishing the safety of pure skepticism and accepting unverifiable connection—is legible but could be felt more sharply with one or two moments of stronger resistance before she yields. Relationships are largely off-page (mother, Voss, past figures in memories), but they nonetheless pressure her choices effectively for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vey’s boredom, ancient grief, and tentative hope around “goodbye” are sharply etched and culminate in a credible, costly choice to step through the door. His willingness to aid the mutineers rather than oppose them follows cleanly from being “already exiled in endless time.” The mortal leader gets just enough differentiation (aurora eyes, future of pilgrimage) to matter, but the technician group as a whole feels more like a chorus than fully pressuring individuals. Some internal contradiction under peak pressure (fear vs desire at the threshold) could be embodied a touch more to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cassidy’s motivation is sharp and particular—an “honest” use of a con legacy to buy her mother’s posthumous dignity—and her final trade (lullaby for asylum) feels earned. Her refusal to grieve alongside meticulous, almost clinical focus on the “equation” gives her an interesting contradiction. Rurik’s status and hypocrisy are efficiently sketched and his collapse at the end tracks emotionally. A slightly deeper, messier glimpse of Cassidy’s ambivalence in the moment of paying with her last honest memory could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aurelia’s motives (to “collect the textures of different times” and to understand the hush) are clear, consistent, and particular to her craft. Her internal conflict surfaces sharply when she “tried to stop, fearing she would exhaust the world’s longing, but the earnestly studious part of her kept writing,” which feels psychologically credible. Change is modest but real: she leaves with a heavier truth about history and her complicity in pruning it. The only limitation is that her emotions are mostly expressed via concept and metaphor rather than more varied, embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—to prove her own reality by aggregating other people’s stories—is clear, particular, and drives her choices from the opening through the final act of seeding the containers. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart hammered against the death certificate”) rather than abstract. The main limitation is a relative lack of direct on-page contradiction in her impulses; she moves with consistent purpose more than conflicted ambivalence, which slightly flattens her under pressure. Still, the final renunciation of her documented name in favor of a nameless, story-bound identity feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlen’s interiority is specific and conflicted: a professional debunker driven by a genuine hunger for mystery, crystallized in lines like “gloomy cheerfulness clung to him like salt spray.” His skepticism and longing are put under pressure by the summoned voices, especially his own liquefying TV boast about measurement. The final choice—accepting an unprovable experiential answer and leaving with “no proof except the memory of voices”—feels earned and costly for a myth buster. The only small limitation is that no live relationship on the page further pressures him; all interlocutors are echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lina’s motives are clear and particular—“culture shock absorber” with a divided loyalty—and her actions (graffiti signal, convening people, choosing subversive reorganization over open refusal) arise cleanly from that contradiction. Emotional texture is embodied via the stone chip, breath-counting, and her response to the children. The final stance—treating change as “another act, not the closing curtain”—is earned from her earlier ambivalence and pragmatism. Secondary characters are sketched but functional as a collective pressure rather than individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inspector’s motives (to witness and record the anemones’ extinction) are concrete, consistent, and beautifully entwined with her history (grandmother’s camera, stolen grain). Interiority is specific and embodied—touching tooth-marks on the focus ring, feeling the blush through basalt—rather than abstract labels. Her contradictory impulses (scientific detachment vs grief and guilt, urgency vs wanting to linger) are dramatized in choices like keeping the shutter open even as the end begins. The final endurance—choosing to witness to the last second—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira is vivid, competent, and particular, with her blindness and tactile/light-based practice giving her real texture and shaping every choice. Her motivation (“to decode feedback into direction”) is dramatized when she treats the drone’s panic as akin to her own trauma and chooses to retrain rather than just repair it. Internal conflict is present but relatively subtle—her memory of the infirmary and her cultivated calm could be pushed further into contradiction under time pressure. Col functions cleanly as a foil and helper without stealing focus, though their relationship’s emotional stakes remain light.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren is sharply drawn: her dry wit, cartographic mindset, and quiet defiance (“swallowed her editor’s instinct to annotate”) feel particular and consistent. Her core motivation—curiosity about river origins and distrust of the Registry—coherently drives each choice from ignoring the radio to misdirecting the data. What’s missing for the very top tier is a stronger on-page sense of internal conflict under pressure; she moves from duty to rebellion with striking calm and little torn feeling. The endurance/renunciation at the end (choosing myth and secrecy) is credible but carries a mostly conceptual rather than deeply felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s vocation, loss of his own bell, and guilt-driven need to restore Viremont give him a clear, specific motivation that pays off in his final self-sacrificial act. However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched—he never seriously hesitates before giving up his remaining self, which slightly flattens what could be a sharper crucible moment. The embodied link between his body (“hollow inside his chest”) and the town’s bones is excellent character work. His final transformation into the tenth bell reads earned but emotionally a touch too serene for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motives (duty as signal-sender, guilt, faith in maps and the vial) are specific and consistent, and her key choices—diving deeper instead of fleeing, sacrificing the vial, staying to record the chords—are well-motivated. The internal contradiction between survival instinct and responsibility is on the page (“She overrode her own instinct to flee”), giving her endurance real cost. Emotions are embodied and idiosyncratic (pressure-bruised knees, lungs burning, lilac as childhood air) rather than generic. The arc from exiled cartographer to adopted voice of the temple feels earned and forecloses her earlier stance of mere observer.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cassian’s motivation—to reclaim and rewrite an inherited parable—is distinct and consistent, and his micro-choices (bringing the lattice, reading the mattress text, fitting wood to lens, stepping onto the “lies-staircase”) track well with that drive. The father is sketched with economical, potent touches (“coat buttoned with barnacles,” “voice rusted shut”) that make his limited on-page presence impactful. Internal conflict between honoring his father’s version and claiming his own is implied rather than fully dramatized, so the renunciation at the end, while coherent, could feel more viscerally conflicted. Still, the final stance—“this time the wolf is me, and I am not early, I am exact”—is credibly earned by the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ghost bride’s motivation—exacting and then transforming a generational debt—is sharply drawn and consistent, and the boy’s inherited guilt vs. innocence is legible even with limited interiority. Her “lovingly venomous” cruelty in early visits adds moral complexity that pays off in her final act of mercy. The boy’s shift from terror to near-ecstatic understanding is effective, though his interior life remains somewhat archetypal rather than deeply individuated. The final exchange with the seed convincingly seals a genuine change for both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Calyx’s motivation—to repair “broken precedents” and reweave a path from ruin to reverence—is clear and consistent, and his key choices (surrendering to the dream, sewing the plate, bleeding onto the cloth) align with that drive. However, he remains more archetypal than individuated; we rarely see contradictory impulses or character-specific blind spots under pressure. Emotional texture is carried more by the world than by his particular psyche. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting the sealed labyrinth and continuing his work) is earned but emotionally muted rather than sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The returnee’s motives (diaspora pull, broken faith, ancestral obligation) are specific and consistently dramatized in her choices—kneeling to whisper wind-hymns over colonial skulls, using her own exile as the price to finish the rebuilding. Internal conflict (resentment vs longing) is present but more implied than actively dramatized in scene, which keeps this just shy of maximal nuance. The caretaker boy is lightly but effectively sketched, applying immediate pressure with “rebuild or rob?” and then becoming an ally once her stance is clear. Her final choice to stay forever feels earned and costs her future journeys in a way that’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation and inner conflict—whether to finally attach her true name to her words—are clear and consistent, with good use of specific memory (“twelve years old, mailing a postcard to her future self”). Her contradictory impulses (desire to be found vs. fear of being falsely known) are active on the page and credibly drive micro-choices. Emotional experience is largely embodied through interaction with objects (clipboard, chalk, drone) rather than abstract labels. The final renunciation (keeping the confession) feels earned and costs her something genuine.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The embroiderer’s motives and methods are beautifully consistent—listening, misdirection, and subversive care—but interior conflict stays mostly implicit, so we lose some lived ambiguity under stress. Her key choice—to expose the conspiracy and then redirect it toward “adjacent possibilities” of survival—feels fully earned by prior beats about hidden layers and coded stitching. Status dynamics with the scholars and lieutenant are sharp, with her apparent frailty masking real power. A slightly deeper, more embodied glimpse of fear or doubt in the gun-drawn moment would push this into true masterwork range.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s guilt and longing are concrete, specific, and embodied in objects (unsent letters, the watch, the cut lip), and the final apology feels fully earned by the prior build-up. Internal contradiction—wanting to avoid pain vs. wanting repair—plays out implicitly in following the medium into a frighteningly intimate space. The brother, though mostly seen in memory/vision, registers as a particular person through small details (bleeding knuckles, whistling while fixing radios). The medium is a little archetypal, but her “fierce tenderness” and barnacled presence give her enough individuality for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s guilt, professional identity, and impulse to “unknot by naming” are concrete and consistent, and the boy’s presence sharply focuses that internal conflict. Micro-choices—staying when asked, confessing about the birthday, reinterpreting the symbols aloud—feel motivated and carry emotional cost. The relationship dynamic (adult translator/child witness) is clear and pressurized without sentimentality. There’s a slight safety in how self-aware and articulate the narrator is under trauma, but it mostly fits their educated, reflective role.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Luma’s desire to reclaim a lost, childhood joy is clear and consistently expressed through her actions—seeking the fragment, invoking the Lattice, and choosing the painful act of repainting the memory. Her interiority is particular and embodied via sensory metaphors rather than labels (“each brushstroke cost her a sigh of present sorrow”). However, her internal conflict remains relatively undebated on the page; resistance and fear are implied more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final shift to “heart over-exposed” is earned but could feel even sharper with one beat of explicit hesitation or conflicting impulse before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s inner conflict between her practiced certainty (“sure strokes of rabbit-skin glue”) and the nickel’s offer of curiosity is clear, specific, and drives her key choices. Her method, frustration, and eventual acceptance of being “both question and answer” all feel motivated and earned. The emotional register stays a bit cool and conceptual, leaving some potential depth of messy, embodied feeling untapped. Still, for this length and mode, the character arc is coherent and persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlo reads as a specific, consistent “charming rogue scholar,” with motivation cleanly tied to protecting thought from taxation and small, telling backstory gestures (“talked a librarian into torching overdue records”). His micro-choices under pressure—how he answers the vegetal code, where he plants the seed, how he uses Lucretius as code—are well-motivated and aligned with his persona. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; he’s mostly sure of himself, so internal contradiction is muted. The dynamic with Voss hints at a richer relationship but is only lightly developed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zale’s insomnia, inherited charge, and bone-deep fatigue are clear and specific, and his choices (climbing each night, finally planting the postcard) align with that long-haul vocation. The interiority is vivid if somewhat abstracted into image rather than concrete bodily experience, but it still feels character-particular. His final move—relinquishing centuries of longing to the shell and allowing himself sleep—reads as an earned renunciation with real cost. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper on-page contradiction between his desire for rest and his attachment to the role before that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—protecting the names and “deserted marvels” even at the cost of her own memories—is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly to full self-erasure. Interiority is embedded in the images (foxglove heart, glass-orchid petals) rather than spelled out, giving her a distinct, non-generic emotional texture. The major choice to sacrifice her own name and memory of self is well prepared by earlier, smaller sacrifices (Por, her mother) but happens with a touch of lyrical inevitability rather than fully dramatized inner struggle. That slight smoothness at the final renunciation is the only thing keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply defined—“carefully reckless,” dutiful, and ethically serious—and her motivation to repair trust through language is consistently embodied in choices (sneaking in early, bargaining with the dead, leaving the ink well). Interiority is largely conveyed through perception and metaphoric framing rather than explicit thought, but the contradictions (reckless vs. meticulous, scholar vs. transgressor) feel active in-scene. The final decision to leave the ink well behind reads as a credible, thematically grounded renunciation. A slightly deeper sense of personal risk or fear—for reputation, life, or relationships—would push this to an even higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mireya is vivid, competent, and morally centered, with her ingenuity and mediating instinct clearly motivating each choice, especially trusting the chain and the lullaby instead of imposing a decree. Her interiority is mostly implied through sensory focus and ritual-like actions rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps her from feeling fully conflicted. The cost to her—taking on the role of enduring mediator and accepting cyclical disputes—is present but understated. A hint more visible doubt or internal friction at the moment of proposing the compromise would deepen the characterization further.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mirela’s motives (fleeing incriminating paper trails, preserving erased songs, reinventing herself) are vivid and consistent, and her actions—hiding the meteorite, building the loft, drafting a new identity—align cleanly with those drives. Interior life is dramatized through embodied detail (iron taste of the meteorite, balance practice on rafters) rather than labels. The relationship with Mr. Blackwood is compact but textured, with believable mutual need. The only limit is that her contradictory impulses (guilt vs. preservation, fear vs. outreach) could surface in more overt, in-scene tension at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Juniper’s motivation—to decode her father’s final message and understand thresholds—is clear and consistently rooted in her history with both parents. Interiority is specific (reading wood, feeling floorboards with bare feet), and her final act of stepping off the terrace feels earned by prior cues. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; she rarely struggles overtly between competing impulses. The emotional cost of accepting necessary distance from her father could be shaded more viscerally in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astrologer is clearly motivated—initially by scientific curiosity, then by a hunger for a deeper, ritualistic “rhythm of belonging”—and her key choices (joining the ritual, refusing to record data, promising to carry the rhythm upward) are earned. Interiority is evocative but somewhat externalized into imagery rather than conflict; we get less of her contradictory impulses under pressure than this premise could sustain. The relationship with Vesper’s echo has texture but not much friction, functioning more as invitation than crucible. The final renunciation of data in favor of embodied memory lands well but could carry even more cost if her prior professional identity were more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is specific and coherent—“sea-foam recollectionist” plus her cheerful engagement with sorrow gives her an identifiable psychology, and her motivation (to understand disappearing paths and loneliness) clearly drives her choices. However, much of her interiority is implied through world metaphors rather than dramatized contradiction, so we don’t see deep, in-scene struggle between competing impulses. Her key turn—reframing the problem from restoring an old path to giving the cliff a “new story”—is motivated but emotionally a bit frictionless. Strong, but not yet at the depth and complexity expected for truly elite character work.

    Cipher is sharply drawn: his analytical, pattern-obsessed mindset and aesthetic mission drive every choice, from collecting tokens to walking away from the jackpot. The internal tension between control and release is present but mostly implied rather than fully dramatized in a moment of real doubt or wobble. Lila and the other figures are functional but skimmed, serving as vectors in his experiment more than as relational pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the slot before the result) feels earned by prior characterization and carries a clear, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysira’s motivations (refusing propaganda, needing to incarnate forbidden memory) are vivid, coherent, and drive every choice in the scene. The exile vs. expression tension is clear and embodied in how she uses her body as page, and the cost of her decision is felt. Internal contradiction is present (she chose absence, but is compulsively drawn back), though it’s more stated than dramatized in conflicting on-page impulses. A touch more real-time hesitation or risk-awareness during the ritual itself would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply etched through occupation, ritual, and perception; details like her scar shaped like Carina and her compulsion to “read between lines” feel particular rather than generic. Her motivation—settling “debts of beauty” before sunrise—is clear and carries through to the prism’s sacrifice. Internal contradiction is relatively mild: she never truly wavers or risks failing the assignment, so her final act feels more like a fulfillment than a difficult choice. For elite publication, one sharper moment where her values genuinely pull against each other would deepen character and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, trauma, and yearning to turn pain into language are richly embodied and consistent from first line to last. Micro-choices—bringing the box, tasting the ash, deciding to speak and to attend the survivors’ group—feel motivated and costly. The “bargain” of survival versus guilt is clear and his shift from mute carrier to commissioned speaker is earned. A hair less than perfect because his inner contradiction (desire to stay mute vs. need to speak) could surface with slightly more friction at the decision to go public.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to logically engineer hope to revitalize a dying reality—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied (“logical dreamer,” equations in sleep, blood on silk). Her interiority is present but more emblematic than personally idiosyncratic, which keeps her from feeling fully singular. There’s some contradiction (rationalist using quasi-mystical ritual) but it’s thematically neat rather than truly conflictual. The closing choice to reset the gauge to “unknown” and walk into the tide feels earned, though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization as a specialist whose professional detachment erodes into personal entanglement works well, especially once “Mira Vale” clicks and the legacy becomes literal. Her motives—curiosity, duty, and an inchoate pull toward the building—are coherent, but her internal conflict (fear vs. compulsion) is more implied than dramatized in specific micro-choices. The moment she recognizes the echo as her great-grandmother’s final exhalation is strong but could carry more embodied reaction. Overall she feels particular, just shy of fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The painter’s motivation—to shift mirrors from flat truth to possibility—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially the risk of surrendering the heartbeat. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her own pulse bucked”) and we feel a credible tension between her perceptive calm and inner uncertainty. The trade of her mother’s laughter for the heartbeat efficiently signals flaw and cost. There could be slightly more on-page ambivalence when she actually relinquishes the heartbeat, but the choice is still earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen is sharply etched: the “forever war peace negotiator” whose clipboard bears the dead gives us clear, embodied motivation and history. His choice to turn from burning the treaty to transforming it through ritual feels earned by the setup of his guilt and study. Internal conflict is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment thought or contradictory impulses under pressure. The crowd functions more as a chorus than as individuated characters, but that suits the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The philanthropist’s motives—curiosity, guilt, self-excusing amorality, and secret sentimentality—are cleanly established and drive every action, from financing the dam to orchestrating the ritual and swallowing the echo. Interiority is concrete and particular (“guilt calcified inside him like secret sentimental plaque”), and the internal contradiction between “amoral” self-image and aching nostalgia is dramatized rather than labeled. His final choice to become the vessel for the echo, yet plan new dams tomorrow, reads as an earned stasis with visible cost rather than a tidy redemption. The only small limitation is that everything is filtered solely through his perspective, so no relational crucible sharpens his blind spots further.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lys’s motivation—to break both the city’s enforced obedience and her own contractual confinement—is clear and consistently drives her actions, from carrying the echoes to refusing the weaver’s cloak. Her interiority is vivid in moments like feeling her blood “answer in iambs,” but the piece leans more toward emblematic figure than fully conflicted person. Internal contradiction (duty vs. fear vs. desire) is present but lightly sketched rather than dramatized in specific wavering or missteps. The final renunciation of escape to become “the first voice that refused to echo” feels earned and carries real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lucien’s motivation—his crisis over “aesthetic elitism” and what ethical storytelling requires—is clear and consistently drives his actions. The magical reversal ritual externalizes his internal debate effectively, especially the choice to “letter them with questions rather than answers.” However, his inner conflict remains largely conceptual and serene; we don’t feel much irrational push‑pull or genuinely ugly flaw on the page. The transformation, while earned enough for this length, lands slightly fast and tidy for a truly elite literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories through an ephemeral memorial—is clear, specific, and consistent, and her micro-choices (choosing this day, accepting the butterfly’s claim, letting the memorial go) all align with that drive. Emotional texture is embodied (“each breath tasting of moss and mineral,” her crying in the stillness), but internal conflict is muted; she rarely wavers or resists, so we see more devotion than contradiction. The grandmother’s maxim gives a credible ethos but also externalizes some insight that could have been dramatized as inner tension. The final sense of loss/completion reads earned, but the cost is primarily conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s history as a bell-caster and organ-smashing apprentice gives him a distinctive, coherent psychology, and his motive—atonement through preservation—feels specific rather than generic. Interiority is richly embodied in tactile rituals (warming the rope, feeling the hum in his ribs) rather than label-speak. The key change—shifting from guilt-ridden destroyer of sound to consenting carrier of others’ voices—is clearly earned. Internal contradiction (destructive past vs “technically gentle” present) could be surfaced a shade more directly in the peak beat, but it’s still strongly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is clear, purposeful, and embodied, with consistent motivation (“to discover why some paths choose their walkers”) and actions that follow from it. However, she remains more archetype than fully individuated person; we get little contradiction or messy interior conflict beyond her function as hinge between past/future. Her emotional texture is conveyed mostly through image rather than specific, character-particular feeling. The final surrender to the storm feels earned conceptually but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Naram-bel’s motives are vivid and consistent—his frugality, scientific caution, and hunger for a transcendent covenant all drive his choices. The internal tension between empirical rigor and quasi-religious faith in mathematics is dramatized rather than merely told. His final renunciation—choosing to “become the silence between regimes”—feels earned by everything before. The only limitation is that his struggle is almost entirely interior, with little external pressure complicating his psychology in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s characterization as a “scheming pacifist” is vivid and consistent, and her internal contradiction—using a broken instrument of comfort to manipulate war-ghosts—feels rich. The emergence of the shadow-Lira externalizes her buried rage in a way that feels psychologically acute, not schematic. Her final act of leaving the box behind is motivated by the earlier realization that she has been stockpiling anger, and reads as a costly, earned relinquishment. The ghosts themselves are thinner but serviceable archetypes for her project.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is lucid and consistent—the need to recapture the runaway dream to heal her severed self tracks cleanly through every beat, and the inherited breathing ritual grounds her interiority in something concrete. Interiority is specific and image-driven rather than generic, especially in how memory of her mother entwines with craft. Internal conflict (desire for boundary-erasure vs. the need for integration/grounding) is present but could surface more as on-page hesitation or fear in the corridor sequence, which feels a touch too assured. Her final stance is earned but comes with relatively soft, low-friction cost, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mender’s motivation (honoring a breached contract, keeping the orchard alive, protecting her daughter’s future) is vivid and consistent, and her choices—opening the forbidden pouch, barring the elders—feel rooted in that drive. Interiority is particular (“deciduous vows,” coconut oil and playground dust) and embodied through craft rather than labels. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she rarely seems genuinely torn so much as righteously determined, which slightly softens the sense of cost. The daughter’s brief on-page presence is effective but remains more emblematic than deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s desire to pursue forbidden knowledge versus her fear of losing her past is clear and motivating, and her micro-choices (questioning the trees, entering the bathroom, using the cameo, finally stepping through the page) emerge credibly from that tension. Her interiority is vivid and particular, though often rendered via concept rather than fully embodied sensation. The cost of her final transformation into “both book and librarian” is felt but still slightly abstracted. There’s room for one or two more grounded, idiosyncratic emotional beats to deepen her singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—her drive to access the library and “steal back” unlearned lessons is embodied in concrete choices like sacrificing a year of her life. Her competence is vivid, and “carefully resourceful” is shown rather than told through tactics with the diary and the sentence-cutting. Internal contradiction is present but light; she accepts the cost of losing a year with minimal visible hesitation, which slightly flattens potential emotional complexity. The relationship with the time traveler provides secondary pressure and cooperation but doesn’t deeply test their bond.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chimera twin is vivid, internally conflicted, and specific, with the split between “heights” and “depth” embodied in her mismatched feet and in the fused sister’s heartbeat. Motivation (to recapture their name / reach the garden of forgotten names) is clear and drives every major choice. The shared body/dual self relationship is powerful, though the embedded sister’s interiority remains more symbolic than psychologically individuated. The final integration—singing one name with two throats—feels earned and carries genuine cost in accepting “monster, miracle, or mistake.”

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply etched as a competent, quietly driven professional whose worldview (reading absences like sailors read wind) feels particular and lived-in. Her motivation to “translate confusion into clarity” is consistent and guides every choice, from entering the tower to braiding the village into the rope. What’s missing at this tier is visible internal contradiction or cost—she never wavers, doubts, or pays much emotionally beyond a calm fulfillment, which keeps the arc from deepening into true transformation. The result is a strong, elegant character study that stops short of genuine fracture or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mapkeeper’s core drive—preserving quiet and stories after the “massacre of sound”—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete tactics (ice augury, map-carrying, cracking the dome). Interiority is present but relatively spare; we see resolve and weariness more than live contradiction or messy ambivalence. Jalen functions mainly as foil and helper rather than a full crucible for her choices, though his “reckless whispers” do sharpen her role. The final act of risking everything to place the map and release the stored voices feels motivated and earned, but the emotional cost could be shaded more specifically in her body and thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The custodian’s motive (rekindling the lamp to prove coincidences have meaning and connect her to her mother) is clear, consistent, and drives her choices. Interiority is conveyed mostly through image rather than articulated contradiction, so her emotional ambivalence and the burden of retrocognition remain slightly under-explored. The key turn—accepting herself as the new prism—is well motivated by what we’ve seen of her past and her journey. A bit more on-page friction in her decisions would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s motivation—whether to let the Archive fix a single “pure” self or embrace a composite identity—is clear and present from the opening and steadily deepens. Her contradictory impulses (yearning for coherence vs. horror at “amputation”) play out in concrete choices: measuring, considering stepping off, then sculpting and walking away. Emotional texture is strong but a bit abstract at times; we get tears and bodily cues, yet most feeling is encoded in metaphor rather than in more varied, immediate embodiment. The final stance as “hinge between them” feels earned by prior conflict, with a believable cost in leaving her role and memories behind.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Luma’s motive and way of moving through the world (chanting, trading, using bespoke magic) are specific and consistent, and her choices clearly drive events. However, she operates more as an archetypal force of hope than as a fully conflicted individual; we don’t see substantial contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure. The governor functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a psychologically complex foil. The relationship with Jax adds texture and courage-mirroring but doesn’t truly test or complicate her priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s motivation—testing if reconciliation is possible during the tide’s pause—is distinct, embodied, and consistently refracted through her observational habit and grief. Her flaw (indirection/tangentiality) is both asset and cost, and the apology via the jade cicada is a credible, specific gesture. The daughter is less interior but still individuated through hesitance, shadow play, and her sideways adoption of the mother’s metaphor-speak. The final choice to resume the difficult conversation as “tidal” feels earned and forecloses the easier path of avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s claustrophobia, reverence for silences, and bunker upbringing cohere into a specific psyche, and her final refusal to carry the “final silence” grows organically from what we’ve seen. Micro-choices—only stepping “three planks forward,” trading a bolt-memory, opening the doll’s skull—sharply reveal her values under pressure. Internal conflict between hoarding safety (bottled silences like her father’s oxygen) and wanting to outgrow confinement is present in scene rather than summarized. The only small limit is that her relationship with her parents is implied rather than directly felt, which slightly mutes relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nilo’s motivations (curating hush, teaching silence) and micro-choices (lowering the rope, easing the throttle, tuning the dial to zero) are clear and consistent, and the commuter’s fear is distilled into one precise, embodied confession. Interiority is mostly implied through behavior and objects rather than explicit thought, but the specificity of the fear about the child feels lived-in, not generic. The commuter’s change—lighter by one confession—is credible and earned for this length, while Nilo’s more static arc reads as an intentional, principled endurance. A bit more sharpened contradiction in Nilo (comforter vs. control freak) on the page could deepen characterization further.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lore keeper’s motivation and role in the Keeper Line are clear and specific, and her professional worldview comes through in how she reads murals and fragments. However, she moves through the scene with very little internal contradiction or visible emotional struggle under pressure. The climactic acceptance of responsibility feels earned conceptually but not strongly dramatized as a difficult or costly choice. The result is a well-drawn but somewhat frictionless protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shadow keeper is sharply etched: her self-imposed exile, ritualized suffocation, and ambivalent caretaking feel particular and embodied. Her motives—retreating from expectations yet compulsively tending damaged souls—are coherent and in tension. The boy is thinner but still registers as a specific pressure (loved-to-death perfectionism). The ending endurance (she stays, keeps practicing suffocation despite the boy’s gift) reads as an earned, costly stasis rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation—transmuting the psychic and financial damage of the scam into something tangible—is clear and consistently rooted in her past as a pyramid scheme survivor. Her contradictory impulses (vengeance vs. forgiveness, restitution vs. mischief) are dramatized in choices like “if alternate selves could haunt her, she could pick their locks” and spending forgiveness as a currency. The final renunciations (declining more unpaid labor and discarding the diamond) feel earned by the prior build-up of shame, pressure, and parallel-self chorus. A touch more embodied emotional fallout in the closing beats could deepen the cost, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arin’s motivation—to hear and then expose the dynasty’s confession—is clear and consistent, and the micro-choices (seeking the handle, turning it, then speaking the words aloud) track well with that drive. The “dynasty ender” backstory and the risk of “losing your name” hint at internal conflict, but we rarely see contradictory impulses playing simultaneously in-scene; Arin’s resolve feels almost too pure. Emotional states are mostly embodied via environment (dust, light, blood) rather than through deeply particular internal texture. The final renunciation of name and alignment with the river people is earned, but sketched more symbolically than psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The knight’s motives (honoring his vow, seeking “the shape of possibility,” fleeing shame) are clear and consistently dramatized through specific choices, especially his decision to surrender his body. Interiority leans archetypal but still feels particular in its fusion of shame, duty, and secret longing for dance. Internal conflict could be sharpened with a bit more on-the-page hesitation or contradiction before the trade. The final endurance as wooden guardian reads as an earned, costly stasis rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rowan’s interiority is rich and specific—her stipend rationalization versus her true motive, the sensory memories of intake, and the tender, almost ritual treatment of the button all feel grounded. Her decisive act of re-housing the button in Marcus’s file is clearly motivated by her foster-care past and desire to magnify kindness. The internal conflict is more about ache versus hope than a sharply opposed pair of impulses, so the cost of her choice (what she forecloses or risks) stays somewhat soft. Still, she reads as a particular, flawed, believable person rather than an emblem.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation and competence are vivid and consistent—from timing drones by Orion to rewiring the booth—but she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. Her backstory with her grandmother and the retired switchman roots her in a specific lineage of resistance and informs her present choices. The final stance (stepping out with hands raised while broadcasting) feels earned and entails an implied cost. What keeps this shy of top-tier is the relative simplicity of her internal conflict: she never truly wavers or missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The saxophonist’s duty, fear, and faint resentment of the villagers are clear and specific, and his micro-choices in how he plays (altered fingering, diminished chord, the final self-erasing note) feel motivated. His backstory with his mother and the whispered prophecy deepens him without derailing the present. Internal contradiction (duty vs. self-preservation, belief vs. skepticism about fate) is present but not fully dramatized in-scene; it stays largely inferred. The endurance at the end—accepting he must return tomorrow—is credible and carries cost, but a touch more in-the-moment ambivalence would sharpen it.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mireya’s motivation (decode the leaves, then restore the arbor) is clear and her choices consistently align with it, especially in retrieving the moonstone and deciding to build monuments. Interiority is present but relatively light; we glimpse wonder and dedication more than a textured mix of doubt, fear, or selfishness. The ongoing “emerge transformed always” motif gives her an arc of increasing attunement but with little visible cost beyond effort and relinquishing control of the moonstone. The role fits the fable-like mode well, yet for top-tier literary work the inner conflict could be sharper and more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—moving from repair-obsessed certainty toward a relationship with uncertainty—is clear, consistent, and drives each major choice (descending to the cellar, leaving the artifacts, later refusing to return below). Interiority is mostly carried through action and image rather than abstract label, and the line “he discovered he wanted the uncertainty the compass promised, not the certainty it replaced” crystallizes a conflict that has been earned. The later-life shards (tavern, fog, final listening at the hatch) all honor this arc without soft resets. If anything, his emotional struggle under peak pressure is slightly cushioned by the lush narration, which keeps this just shy of truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurelia’s motives and contradictions (guilt vs. the need to act, staying behind vs. joining the search) are concrete and specific, with grief routed through her craft in a character-particular way. The “limits” structure externalizes her internal conflict as a series of micro-choices rather than a single neat epiphany. Her final stance—joining the search to teach others how to carry regret—feels earned by what we’ve seen her do with the coin and the foundry. If anything, the closing articulation of her insight edges toward thematic statement rather than staying fully rooted in embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s function and motive are clear—she collects fractured laughter to heal souls—and her choices consistently serve that vocation. Her interiority is vivid in gesture (pressing the tooth to her lips, the “modestly fearless silence”) but we get limited contradictory impulses or real internal friction; she rarely feels on the verge of failing or refusing. The integration of the child’s laughter into her own ribs offers a credible, earned shift, but the cost to her is more implied than dramatized. A bit more lived ambiguity or momentary doubt under pressure would push this toward top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation (“discover the mathematics of mercy”) is specific, obsessive, and drives every on-page choice, including enduring the forest and finally relinquishing the strap. Interiority is rich and embodied—pain as data, guilt as wavelength—without lapsing into diagnostic language. The change is a nuanced Earned Stasis/CR: they accept mercy as an asymptote and act accordingly, offering the strap while knowing they are not “lighter.” A slight limitation is that internal contradiction (self-preservation vs self-destruction) could be surfaced a bit more explicitly in a single, high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s vocation, relationship to the fragment, and tie to the painter are all cleanly motivated and cohere into the central choice to relinquish the shard and role. Interiority is specific and embodied (“the exchange feels like exhaling a life”), and the internal conflict between keeping power/identity and honoring “overlooked histories” is dramatized rather than summarized. The final renunciation (giving the fragment back and stepping away as translator) forecloses a path with visible cost and feels fully earned by prior beats. No major motivational gaps or convenience choices undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is sharply etched: competent, wary, and quietly exhausted, with her profession and ghost-sight braided into how she thinks and chooses. Her internal contradiction—fixing what climbs while seeing what falls—is dramatized rather than told, especially around the choice to leave the mainspring. Emotions are embodied through technical metaphors (“engaged the moment the way she engaged a mis-leveled car”), and the final renunciation feels earned. A slightly cooler emotional temperature keeps this just shy of fully devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corwin’s core motive (“compress eternity,” fix his “cracked” heart with the bottled whisper) is clear and his actions—setting the type, uncorking the whisper, stepping onto the cloud—are coherent with it. However, his inner conflict stays mostly on the conceptual plane; we’re told he’s damaged and driven, but we rarely feel a concrete, embodied struggle or competing impulse in the moment of choice. The cost of using the whisper (risking the library, his role, his reality) is implied more thematically than through visceral hesitation or dread. A bit more textured emotional contradiction at the press or the windowpane would deepen him into truly memorable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurelia’s characterization is rich and internally consistent: a failed revolutionary whose motive (to salvage and reimagine the civilization she couldn’t build) credibly drives each choice, especially the final sacrifice of the shard. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“voice burnished by regret,” twenty years in a lunar quarry), and the poet/revolutionary contradiction plays out on the page rather than being merely labeled. Internal conflict between resignation and renewed imaginative defiance is dramatized through her response to the shard’s visions. The archaeologist is comparatively thin but functions cleanly as immediate pressure rather than a full character, which is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives are clear and layered—duty to the city, guilt about his daughter, fear of the dark stealing her voice—and his confession to the rust is a credible, costly choice. The internal contradiction (world-saver vs neglectful father) lands well in lines like “I came not to save the city first…”. Micro-choices are mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied, so his emotional and physical experience could be more viscerally present. Still, the closing reunion with his daughter feels earned and reframes him convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ivy’s motives (collecting “beginnings,” the promise to find where explanations fail) are vivid and consistent, and her actions at each turn track cleanly to those drives. The embodied response to psychometry (“in her knees, buckling her onto the wet planks”) gives her interiority texture rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but relatively subtle—terror vs “politeness” at the lagoon—so the psychological knot could be tightened slightly. Her final transformation into a “hinge” feels earned by prior choices and costs her former, more observational role.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maela feels specific and textured—a sculptor whose relationship to driftwood, storms, and “the grammar of currents and wind” is vivid and character-particular. Her motivation (to understand whether the slide is gift or geas, to reframe escape as arrival) is clear, and her final refusal of the GPS is a believable outgrowth of earlier attitudes. However, internal contradiction under pressure is underplayed: she rarely hesitates or missteps, so the decision at the arch reads more like an inevitable ritual than a hard-won choice. A touch more fear, doubt, or counter-impulse in the middle stretch would deepen the sense of genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motivation is specific and consistent—this is a story about an artist whose obsession with “dawning hush” and night-blooming flowers clearly shapes every choice she makes. Her interiority is sensuous and particular (postcards, bark as leading, frost on eyelashes), and the gradual thaw of her inner winter reads as an earned shift rather than a flip. The contradiction between her lifelong dawn-painting and the pull toward night and shadow gives her a live internal tension. The only limit at this length is that we rarely see her resist or falter; her drive feels nearly frictionless, which slightly softens the perceived cost of her final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mireya’s profession, history with her mother, and ethical drive are sharply etched, and her micro-choices under pressure (offering pieces of her future, deciding to broadcast) feel rooted in character. The embodied cost of “futures closing like doors” lands. Internal contradiction (loyalty to mother vs duty to the disappeared) is present but could surface more viscerally in the final decision, which resolves quickly once named. Still, the arc from archivist-observer to incendiary witness is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemist’s motivation—privileging “the integrity of endings” over comfort—is clear and consistently drives choices, especially in refusing the bottle and inventing the burn-at-new-moon ritual. Interiority is concrete and particular (recipes, mother’s eyes, municipal bylaws for gulls), giving a lived-in sense of mind. The main weakness is that contradictory impulses (loneliness vs. ruthless commitment to truth) are implied more than directly dramatized in tense, in-the-moment hesitation. A bit more felt tug between wanting company and rejecting resurrection myths could deepen the final choice’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ambrose’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent—his history as an oath scribe, born speaking dead languages, clearly motivates his impulse to archive and then to suppress the prophecy. The small but crucial conflict between his lifelong vow (to record) and his fear of naming disaster gives him a credible, costly choice at the basin. His acceptance of becoming the city’s new foghorn—“a voice neither alive nor dead, only remaining”—reads as an Earned Stasis consistent with his vocation and burden. The only limit is that all pressure is intra-psychic and symbolic; no relational crucible or counter-force on the page tests him beyond his own disposition.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The seed saver’s vocation, lineage, and small tactile habits (gloved palm, acorn in pocket, naming ancestors) make her feel specific and embodied, and her final choice to “circulate” feels motivated by that heritage. The internal conflict at the climax—preserve, surrender, or circulate—is present but sketched more as an abstract moral stance than as a lived emotional wrench, which slightly mutes the cost. Her emotional life is conveyed more through imagery than contradiction on the page; we glimpse values more than messy impulses. Still, her micro-choices track cleanly with the stated goal of guarding possibility and time.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivations are clear, specific, and consistently carried through: professional rigor, filial legacy, and a quasi-spiritual commitment to “listening over noise.” Her micro-choices (rerouting the timer, climbing to the belfry, choosing the bell over the siren) all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The grief for her father is economical yet vivid, and it meaningfully colors present-tense perception (the rope smell, missing his humming) rather than sitting as inert backstory. The final realization about courtesy feels earned rather than tacked on, though her internal conflict could be sharpened by a touch more fear or ambivalence about consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The janitor’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with clear motivation rooted in grief and reverence for the sky (“for the planet that had forgotten how to look up”). His spiritual curiosity directly drives his actions—talking to meteors, touching the ember—and culminates in a credible change when he relinquishes the lantern and leaves. Contradictory impulses (custodian of silence vs. yearning for connection) are present but could be dramatized more sharply under pressure rather than mostly described. Still, the final renunciation feels earned and carries a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alden’s motivation—to preserve the weight of unspoken words—is clear, embodied, and consistently deepens as the burden grows (“the weight Alden carried in his chest increased”). His temperament (“tranquilly perceptive”) informs his choices and how he relates to ghosts, and the final vow feels earned by prior pages of quiet duty. There is some internal tension (stay versus leave, keep versus release), though it remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a fraught on-page hesitation. For this length, however, his endurance and renunciation read as a credible, costly stance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The timekeeper’s interiority is specific and textured—his attachment to the urn shard, his reaction to the tags, and his bodily sense of “granular” time all feel particular rather than generic. Motivation is clear and consistent from the first paragraph through the garage sale sequence. The small but real shift—reframing his role from measurer to exchanger of sensations—reads earned, especially when he gives up the urn fragment. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper on-page contradiction or internal tornness under pressure; his arc is graceful rather than embattled.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motives and inner life are clear, specific, and embodied in his rituals and choices (collecting fragments, drawing the spiral, giving away the feather). His realization about “not to finish the chord but to let it hover” is thematically grounded and earned by prior behavior. The woman is sketched economically yet distinctly (cracked zither, chipped tooth, lunar smile) and her presence exerts real pressure through collaboration. Internal contradiction is relatively gentle—more contemplative than conflicted—which slightly limits the depth of psychological torque.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is crystal-clear from the diary line “Final renovation—purpose: foster interspecies respect,” and every choice flows from that in a consistent, particular way. Her profession, temperament, and diagnosis all inform how she behaves—the brazen calm with fox and tourists, the rigorous note-taking, the physical commitment to the wiring work. We get embodied, concrete interiority (“not a death sentence but a deadline”) rather than abstractions, and her acceptance at the end reads as earned stasis rather than tidy epiphany. The only reason this doesn’t land higher is that her internal contradictions under pressure (fear vs duty, selfish wish to live vs sacrificial work) stay mostly implicit rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s skepticism, exile from the Guild, and scientific obsession are sharply etched, and her perception of memory as chemistry feels particular rather than generic. Her reactions to the spores—filtered through scent and bodily memory—are vivid and character-specific. However, her internal conflict and the emotional cost of losing the tower/path skim the surface; she adjusts to a profound transformation with minimal visible struggle. A touch more friction between her skeptic identity and the overwhelming experience would deepen the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The coachman’s motivation—to heal the battlefield and honor an ancient treaty—is clear and consistently expressed through his ritual actions. We see cost (his voice cracking, tongue bleeding, renunciation of carrying weapons) and a meaningful change in his vocation. However, interior contradiction is light; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses, which keeps him slightly archetypal rather than deeply individuated. The gull functions more as witness than as a crucible relationship, so we lose an opportunity for character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Scraps and Kite both have clear, specific motives—Scraps’ compulsion to “translate distance into closeness” and Kite’s need to recover her brother—and their actions track cleanly from those drives. Scraps’ retirement versus instinct gives a credible internal tension, though it could be dramatized more directly under pressure. The relationship between Kite and Scraps evolves convincingly from wary alliance to deep trust with minimal but effective gestures (the bark, the shared decoding). The brother is more emblematic than fully realized, but for this length that mostly works.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s grief, survivor’s guilt, and attachment to his mother are specific and embodied (“eyes ringed with the guilt of surviving”), and his rituals and micro-choices (coming to the sealed deck, entering the hatch, taking her hand) feel rooted in that history. The internal contradiction—clinging to the dead yet unable to live fully with the loss—is clear, though not deeply contested in the moment of crossing. His final choice to go with her is emotionally motivated but comes quickly, with only a brief sense of cost. The relationship with the mother, though mostly off-stage, is vividly realized through objects and habits rather than summary labels.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vespers is sharply etched as a chivalrous, wonder-driven thief whose choices clearly drive the story, especially in the queen sacrifice, bishop swap, and passing on the sundial. Motivation is consistent—she “steal[s] only what people no longer dare to keep”—and her tactics embody that credo. However, interior conflict is largely implied rather than dramatized; we rarely feel her in doubt or under real emotional strain. Halcyon is vivid but mostly functions as a foil, not a fully contested presence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply etched—former crisis actor turned witness—with motives grounded in trauma and an ethic of “benevolently ruthless” remembrance; Kestrel is sketched efficiently through how he mirrors and reverses her arc. Her choices (tying the lace to the queen, answering via walking, leaving with him) feel motivated and specific. Internal conflict is more stated than dramatized—the ruthlessness vs. tenderness mostly sits in narration rather than in a charged on-page dilemma. The relationship turn—from potential executioner/target to co-conspirators in memory—is convincing and layered but could tolerate one more moment of embodied ambivalence under the gun.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The seer’s motivation—reclaiming the true shape of home without re-weaponizing her gifts—is vivid, specific, and carries through every choice. Her guilt over prophecy, desire for erasure, and stubborn integrity collide in the bargain scene with the custodian and in the refusal to re-seed talents. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“wheat stalks brushing thighs,” “thunder at last rolling quietly behind her eyes”) rather than abstract labels. The only minor limit is that her contradictions (longing for power vs. renunciation) could flare a bit more messily under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marek’s guilt, professional pride, and hunger for absolution are specific and consistent, and the chess-tutor lens makes his interiority feel particular rather than generic. His decisive acts—decoding the tapestry, choosing to walk the maze, righting the fallen king—arise credibly from that psychology. The shift from self-punitive exile to a stance of earned, provisional self-forgiveness lands with felt cost. The only restraint on a higher score is that his contradictory impulses (self-flagellation vs. desire to rejoin life) could be made microscopically more dramatized in real-time choice rather than mostly in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motives (guilt over the queen, refusal to carry all blame, artistic defiance) are vivid and consistent, and her internal contradiction—both defiant and haunted—drives every choice. Embodied emotion lands well in specific images (the mirror shard, laughter “bright enough to wound,” pressing her forehead to the bone). Her final acceptance of “the cost” and decision to leave the ritual path for a new painting practice feels earned and forecloses a prior way of living. The only limiter is that no living relationship is on the page to actively contest her stance in real time; all relational pressure is remembered or symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—creating meaning rather than resurrection—is clear, specific, and borne out in her final sacrificial choice. Her internal split between terror and purpose (“her uncertain heart wavered between salvation and suicide”) is dramatized rather than told. Micro-choices (strapping herself in, pressing the charm to the porthole despite the chains snapping) make the cost legible. The only minor limitation is that some emotional states are named rather than further embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ren’s motives are clean and specific: preserving the quay through art until the mirror’s failure forces him to honor his private vow to “go where no one has already painted.” His interiority is rendered through sensory and imagistic reactions (salt on his tongue, the gulls as saws) rather than label-words, giving him a distinctive, lived consciousness. The shift from “intimately aloof” to “intimately aloof no longer” at the shell is a precise, earned inflection rather than a blunt epiphany. The final choice to entomb the shell/canvas and leave, carrying only the knowledge of preservation, feels like an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s longing and gentleness are vividly embodied in specific rituals—the cork, the flowers, the lighthouse controls—so her motivation feels clear and particular. However, her inner life skews toward a single, unwavering mode of yearning; there’s little contradicting impulse (resentment, doubt, anger) to complicate her choices. The final stance—devoting her life to transmitting purified intentions—is emotionally earned but carries limited visible cost beyond solitude and devotion. Still, her micro-choices (waiting weeks, timing the ritual, choosing to beckon) align tightly with her core desire.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The navigator’s grief-driven motive (“build a route back to the places grief had emptied”) is clear and coherently escalates into the realization that she is the offering rather than the agent. Interiority is specific and embodied (compass hand, sextant eye, lover’s voice in her throat) rather than generic. The internal contradiction—wanting to reverse loss vs. the cost of becoming the geography others will navigate—is convincingly paid off in her final choice to step into the spiral. The only slight limitation is that her contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in on-page hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivations are clear and particular—seeking relief from overwhelming empathy without losing her moral core—and her fear that “the quiet will be worse than the noise” crystallizes a strong internal contradiction. Micro-choices (descending again, preparing the cure, deciding to drink for a different reason) track tightly with that conflict. Emotional life is rendered through specific, idiosyncratic perception rather than labels, though some therapy-adjacent phrasing (“psychological safety”) edges toward concept-speak. The final stance—choosing to bear rather than mute—feels earned and carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris is sharply realized through her habits (reading absences like signals, logging anomalies) and embodied perceptions, and her motivation to decode the stranger’s gesture clearly drives every choice. The internal conflict—duty/curiosity versus the cost of relinquishing memories—is present but could deepen slightly in the moment of sacrifice. Her final act of releasing the Edelweiss and accepting personal memory loss reads earned by prior setup. Secondary characters are kept off-page, which is appropriate for the piece’s isolated focus.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s loneliness, inherited vocation, and attraction to “the margins of the maps” sketch a credible, particular man, and his father’s promise gives him a clear internal driver. His hesitation at the doorway (“between fear and possibility”) provides a genuine, if brief, moment of contradiction. However, his interior life stays mostly at the surface—there’s little embodied emotion or irrational pushback once the magic appears. The final decision feels earned enough for this length, but not deeply struggled with.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The queen’s motivation (to stop being erased and understand the dreams) is clear and intensifies as mirrors blur and memories bleed away. Her internal conflict between self-preservation and sacrificial stasis at the dais is credible and rooted in prior beats. The future-self loop adds specificity to her desperation rather than feeling like a gimmick. A slight limitation is that her broader personality beyond this crisis (values beyond duty/identity) remains only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corin’s interiority is specific and credible—his “scientifically romantic” urge to quantify feeling collides well with the mentor’s koan and his dawning horror that he’s been “selling absence.” His final choice to crush the pocket-sun between their hands is clearly motivated by this shift and carries relational and ethical cost. Mira is less deeply rendered but still functional as a crucible: her rehearsed casualness, heterochromatic eyes, and deliberate touch create a believable long-standing tension. The main limitation is that his internal conflict trends a bit tidy and essayistic at times, with fewer messy, contradictory impulses than this level of insight might warrant.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s inner life is vivid, particular, and embodied—her envy of “yesterday’s version” and of the eagle and even the corpse is sharply character-specific. Motivation (trying to tame chaos into narrative) is clear and consistently at odds with what the mountain/dreams demand. Micro-choices—writing “The mountain does not care…,” stepping outside, letting the scroll be erased—flow credibly from that tension and carry felt cost. The only minor limitation is that her emotional range tends to stay in one lyrical register of melancholy insight rather than showing more raw degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira is sharply etched: her former mastery of scent, present disability, and tactile “translation” work all align with her motives and choices, especially in how she invests in the screw and then pockets it. Her internal conflict—yearning for meaning without cure—is consistent and particular rather than generic grief. The final renunciation (accepting continued anosmia while reframing her role as midwife of stories) is well earned. A few lines summarize her inner state a bit abstractly, slightly softening the sense of messy contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lina’s motivation and inner conflict are vivid and specific: she’s simultaneously a terrified sister, a disciplined scholar, and a superstitious child revisiting a trauma on purpose. Her micro-choices under pressure (holding her breath despite pain, chasing the superstition’s timing instead of rejecting it) all grow credibly from that mix. The embodied grief—needles in the lungs, memories as motes—keeps emotion grounded rather than abstract. If anything, her final lightness comes very fast given the depth of the wound, but it still feels earned within this compressed form.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The exorcist’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and specific, and the mix of professional bravado and private remorse is well-drawn (“The apology she carried felt heavier than any hex”). Her interiority is strongly embodied through musical and sensory images, and her final choice to release the drop is credibly earned. The sister is more suggestive than fully realized, but her brief appearance still lands emotionally. A touch more contradiction in the narrator’s moment-to-moment impulses could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The witness’s motivation—unraveling cosmic illusions before the hiccup ends—is clear and threads coherently through her choices (placing the dictionary, walking the spiral, surrendering memories). Interiority is vivid and particular in how she perceives space and language, but emotionally she remains more archetype than individuated person. The arc from detached “cartographer of endings” to allowing her own dissolution reads earned, especially through the memory-shedding beat. What’s missing at this tier is sharper contradiction or human-scale messiness in her feelings at the point of self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Torvald’s vocation, grief, and curiosity form a coherent, specific interior life, and his final act of reversing the master clock is credibly motivated by decades of watching “time’s true nature” plus the daughter’s death. However, his internal conflict is more stated than dramatized—there’s little on-page struggle between fear of losing self and desire to understand time, so the surrender of identity feels conceptually rich but not fully embodied. The image of him at seven watching his father wind the clock nicely personalizes his arc. Overall, he reads as a particular person rather than a type, but the epiphanic clarity comes a bit too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation (professional breach plus Luc’s disappearance) is clear and drives her choices through to the merge attempt, with a credible mix of competence and emotional vulnerability. Her internal conflict between reclaiming an “original” Luc and accepting ambiguity surfaces well in the headset scene but could be pressed harder at the instant of decision. The Lucs are sketched efficiently via gesture and rhythm, though they remain more symbolic than fully individuated. Dr. Voss is conceptually strong but functions more as mouthpiece than fully embodied pressure, slightly flattening relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and textured—her mix of resentment, intellectualism, and reluctant tenderness feels lived-in. Her micro-choices (coming to the restricted archives, opening the book, riding to the end of the line, leaving pages and the lantern) track cleanly with that psyche. The revaluation of her father (“the lattice of love beneath the ruin”) is earned rather than abrupt, though the last few sentences tilt a bit close to tidy self-knowledge. Still, the final stance—“She would not gamble, but she would risk”—reads as a credible, costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and specific; the operator’s self-concept as someone who “cultivated estrangement” cleanly motivates both his long stasis and his eventual, costly shift. The relationship with the caller has a clear arc from curiosity to dependence, and the moment at the gate (“I almost did—then remembered my job…”) embodies true internal contradiction under pressure. His final choice to cut the wires and leave is earned by everything before. A minor quibble is that his attachment to the formal “job” as duty, versus to the estrangement itself, could be slightly more embodied earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archivist’s motive—preserving fragile moments in the face of demolition—is specific, embodied, and consistently drives her choices, culminating in the costly decision to give up the locket. Her dual role as professional archivist and mother (the drowned boy vs. her daughter) gives her interiority credible tension without over-explaining. The relationship with the daughter in the final shard is brief but telling, revealing the emotional cost of her earlier choice. A slight hedge is that internal conflict remains mostly implied rather than shown in a moment of real hesitation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kit’s characterization is rich and specific—disaster-relief background, “desperately jocular armor,” and the reciprocity ethic make his choices (giving the rock, running the exchanges, then leaving) feel motivated and particular. His internal conflict between avoidance and service is clear, though it mostly stays implied rather than dramatized in on-page waverings. Lila is vivid in a few strokes (moon tax joke, quick grasp of the “recipe”) but functions more as catalytic foil than fully pressured character. The ending choice to leave “when the story changes” feels earned and carries a subtle, credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The blind mapmaker’s core drive—to finally map his own emotions—is specific, embodied, and consistent from first paragraph to last. His fear of touching his “own interior” versus his compulsion toward the stillpoint gives him credible internal contradiction. The realization that he must “become the map” is earned by prior motifs of tactile mapping and language-absorption. The only slight limitation is that no external relationship or social pressure complicates his choices, keeping the crucible purely intrapsychic.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s vocation, guilt over “planting the wrong seeds,” and trained belief that stories can be unbent all clearly motivate her choice to rewrite the event. The internal tension between confidence and uncertainty is embodied rather than labeled (“Confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand”). Change is modest but real: she moves from paralyzing doubt to a stance of active, ethically aware intervention. The lack of another on-page character limits relational pressure but fits the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The advisor is a strong mythic figure with a clear, coherent motivation (“to translate silence into music”), and the townspeople’s brief vignettes give the collective a felt emotional life. However, he remains more archetype than individuated person, with little interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The town’s change (learning to listen, keeping the camera) functions as the primary “character arc” and is well earned. For top-tier, a hint more specific flaw or cost within the advisor himself would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ember’s core motives (honoring her grandmother, reconciling with her own arson) are clear and consistent, but her emotional life is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses. We’re told her pyromania is about “understanding destruction's dual nature,” yet we never see her truly tempted by destructive fire in this scene or struggle against that impulse. The grandmother relationship has weight, but because the grandmother is entirely off-page, the pressure never sharpens into a relational crucible. Her final transformation into “the final artwork” feels thematically apt but a bit too clean and uncostly to read as fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives (relief from overload vs ethical responsibility to the “grafted” lives) are clear, specific, and drive her choices all the way to the lagoon. Interiority is richly embodied through rhythm, sound, and bodily sensations rather than abstract labels. The quiet-rebel contradiction—hoarding the clinic’s secrets yet seeking to free herself from them—feels particular and paid off in her final stance as “conductor emeritus.” A slight tendency to phrase realization in essayistic terms (“tender accountability”) keeps this just short of fully immersive psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid as a hyper-competent, sensory-tuned worker whose choices drive the story, and small touches (her map-keeping, listening to footsteps) individualize her. The stranger is thinner but consistent: academic, inheritor of a wartime secret, driven by family legacy. Motivation is clear for both—curiosity, duty, and inheritance—but there’s limited on-page internal contradiction or emotional messiness under pressure. The final realization reconfigures Mira’s self-concept (her maps as incomplete), though the emotional cost could be shaded with more complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s grief, voicelessness, and long vigil create a distinct, coherent psyche, and her motivation to “teach [darkness] longing” is clear and sustained. The backstory of the drowned child elegantly motivates her fixation on cradling light within dark without over-explaining. Internal contradiction (mourning the past while tending to the canal’s present darkness) is present but could be sharpened by one or two more moments where her need to comfort the dark conflicts with her unresolved guilt. Even so, her micro-choices with the mirror and shutters feel deeply rooted in who she is and what she’s lost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is sharply defined through action—showing up unasked, smuggling chess sets, orchestrating the nocturnal displays—so her quiet radicalism feels earned. Her interior conflict (coach of fixed games, instigator of rule-breaking) is embedded rather than spelled out, which suits the piece’s subtlety. Ellis is thinner but still distinct, more emblem than fully embodied child, and the crowd is mostly atmospheric. The final choice to fuse sapling and grotto is motivated and forecloses a path (private safety) in favor of public, if quiet, rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions are vivid: she’s both bound to the docks and unwilling to accept a softened world without risk, which makes her choice to lead the raft-city and release the scrimshaw feel earned. Interiority is specific (“tenderness without danger felt foreign, a comb she could not run through her knotted memory”) and her actions track cleanly from that tension. The final shift from clinging to place to embracing motion and open horizon is clear and paid for emotionally. Secondary characters are collective rather than individual, but they function effectively as a pressure and a responsibility rather than needing full individuation here.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The performer is sharply drawn—her history of reporting then forging joy coupons gives real moral grain, and her present choices (whittling as rebellion, narrating to the bouquet, accepting the officer beside her) cohere with that ambiguity. Interiority is mostly carried through behavior and diction rather than explicit feeling labels, which fits the “emotional void” premise while still letting us infer stakes. The officer is sketched efficiently but credibly, especially in the final beat with the badge. The one limitation is that her internal contradiction in the present (complicity vs. resistance) is more implied than dramatized in a concrete dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation—to rewrite law through aesthetics and cross once-sacred boundaries—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions. Her awareness of risk (“a statue of precedent”) gives her a believable inner tension between danger and drive, even if we don’t drill deeply into contradiction or backstory. She feels individual through her metaphoric thinking and relationship to language rather than through personal history. The final choice to “begin the next poem” reads earned as a continuation of an already-established stance rather than a late epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Milo’s drive—from seeking an impossible hue to embracing brokenness—is coherent and paid off, and Rosa’s role as partner/instigator is specific and textured. Motivation is clear (hunger to see, to capture beauty) and his final renunciation of painting carries a felt cost. However, his inner conflict is more narrated than dramatized; we’re told his realization about “the violence of color” rather than fully inhabiting the moment’s turmoil. The relationship dynamic is suggestive and rich but could withstand one sharper scene of embodied friction or risk between them.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell ringer has a clear, particular motive and some lived contradiction (coaxing music from metal in a silencing world), but she often reads more as an allegorical vector than a fully pressured person. Her questioning of the collectors feels almost frictionless—there’s little resistance or emotional cost on the page. The collectors themselves are flat, defined by function rather than individual pressure. The final renunciation of her bells works conceptually but doesn’t fully register as a painful sacrifice in character terms.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mourner’s motivation and arc—from obsessive preservation toward acceptance—are clear and consistent, with her craft and micro-choices (where she places each figure, choosing to leave) rooted in grief. However, her interiority trends toward summarized insight rather than embodied contradiction; we’re told her lesson more than we feel her warring impulses on the page. The decade of solitude and “rock bottom” are efficient but also convenient shorthand that avoid dramatizing struggle. The final renunciation (leaving the observatory) is earned but could carry more visceral cost if her reluctance or resistance surfaced in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cartomancer is vivid, specific, and consistently motivated by the hunger to understand what happened to the world’s story, with inheritance (the grandmother in wartime basements) adding depth. Her actions—gridding the loft, assigning vectors, walking the grid, and sealing away the tools—align clearly with that drive. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; there’s little on-page friction between competing impulses beyond profit vs understanding. The final endurance/renunciation (doing this work in silence, without audience or coin) is earned but emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The historian’s motive (to purify the archive / pursue forbidden knowledge) is clear and sustained, and her internal conflict between erasure and carrying memory is well dramatized (“purification meant erasing the very memories that made her who she was”). Her evolution from solitary specialist to shared-burden teacher reads earned and forecloses the path of becoming the archive’s trapped librarian. However, her psychology remains mostly at a mythic-lyric distance; we rarely see concrete, specific blind spots or messy, individuating flaws beyond the role. The late-introduced survivors function more as thematic mirrors than as pressure sources on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s motivation is sharply defined—preserving unshareable dusk/hope—and her final renunciation (locking the stone/shadow away, becoming the “last dusk”) is credibly earned from that trait. The mother–daughter thread gives her interiority specificity rather than abstraction. Contradictory impulses (drop the stone / keep it; share hope / protect it) are active on the page. The only limitation is that all conflict remains interior and could bear one more moment of embodied struggle before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miren’s inner conflict between guilt, pride, and care is very finely drawn, especially in the beat where she feels Aster’s tail-tip heartbeat and remembers “every animal she had failed.” Her motivations are consistent and escalate plausibly into the ritual unmaking of status (ring, braid, lecture) and the decision to release Aster. The change from expertise-as-identity to doubt-as-ethic lands with felt cost—she renounces reputation and control. A minor limitation is that her flaws are quite cleanly articulated; there’s little mess or pettiness to complicate her moral clarity in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and specific—tasting “iron and lilac,” the willingness to reopen the scar, the guilt around the sister all feel lived-in. Motivation (to seek closure and “read the stories in scars”) is clear and drives every major choice. The internal conflict between holding on to pain and releasing the miracle is present but could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine hesitation or resistance at the key trade. The final shift—wound closing into a period rather than a question mark—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to locate and “incubate” unused love and her mother’s lyrics) is clear, specific, and consistent, and her choices—performing psychometry, inscribing new lyrics—track well with that desire. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with film and projection as her emotional language. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal contradiction or a visible moral/psychological cost to her actions; the arc moves from lack to fulfillment without her flaws meaningfully complicating the journey. The closing transformation is earned but relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dreamer’s motivation—to rescue a buried creative self that has world-scale consequences—is clear, specific, and embodied in choices like dismantling the telescope and lying inside its outline. Backstory about teachers cutting up her galaxy drawings grounds the abstract stakes in a personal wound. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened; she largely moves from conviction to sacrificial action without much on-page hesitation or competing impulse in the climax. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting permanent “rest”) feels earned and carries a real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guard is a strong archetypal figure—calm, ritual-bound, and defined by his job and directive rather than psychological nuance. His motivation (preserve/cultivate the children's dreams and lullabies) is clear and consistent, especially once the “final directive” is named. However, he lacks on-page contradiction or visible internal struggle; he never wavers or pays a personal emotional price beyond a lightened coat. The ending endurance/renunciation (burying the clock, walking away) is motivated but not deeply contested, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The philosopher’s desire to “rediscover the wild frontier of your mind” versus her fear of losing herself is clear and drives her key choice with the gear. Her hesitation on the elevator (“without the gear she might forget her name entirely”) nicely crystallizes contradictory impulses. That said, her psychology is more archetypal than deeply individuated, so the emotional cost stays slightly abstract. The relationship with the jaguar is evocative but functions more as an oracular device than as a fully pressurized interpersonal dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marta, Jun, and the hound are clearly motivated and distinct in role, and Marta’s mentor steadiness vs. Jun’s youth is clean if somewhat archetypal. The hound’s crisis—mistaking external freedom for needed courage—is conceptually strong but resolved very smoothly. Internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized; no one is genuinely tempted to fail or walk away. The emotional turn at the forehead stamping lands, but with limited felt cost or messy contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bellhop’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with the bolt and the lullaby concretizing his motive “to understand the cost of safety.” His actions—carrying the boy, giving him the bolt, practicing stillness—align with a long-formed habit of endurance rather than overt rebellion. The boy and the surgeon are sketched efficiently but carry real weight, especially in the boy’s gaze as a relational crucible. The final Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (remaining while imagining the boy’s future act) feels psychologically earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The titan’s motivation (“precision” and balance over revenge) is clear, consistent, and nicely particular, and his tactics (marginalia, subtle intervention) align with that. However, he experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction under pressure; he’s more an embodied principle than a fully conflicted person. The pretender is sketched vividly but shallowly, with limited interiority. The final act of “already forgetting the man’s face” is thematically strong but doesn’t quite land as a hard-earned emotional cost for him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization as the “last coral bleaching witness” is specific and compelling, and her observational rigor and ritualistic tapping give her a lived-in texture. Motivation—to keep listening, to respond to the summons of the missing path—is clear and consistent across beats. However, internal conflict remains relatively muted; we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull between fear, duty, and grief in the key decision to dive. The final repricing of her role feels earned but could land with more cost if earlier contradictions or reluctance were more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stargazer’s motives—to keep the sky open and “discover meaning in the mess”—are clear, embodied, and consistently drive her choices. Her “awkwardly confident” stance and barefoot physicality give her a particular, non-generic presence. However, internal contradiction and real-time ambivalence are relatively light; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible emotional price for bold choices. The final shift from “awkwardly confident” to confidence “welded to bone” lands, but the cost of that change is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nara is sharply drawn—a limping, plant-telepathic insurgent grandmother with a clear throughline from grief to subversive care—and her choices consistently align with that motivation. Her embodied stakes (knees screaming, cane of bombing debris, heartbeat as ultrasound) keep her from feeling archetypal. Internal contradiction is present but fairly soft: she’s resolute more than genuinely torn, so complexity comes more from circumstance than from deep ambivalence. The closing endurance—choosing quiet, slow rebellion over open confrontation—reads earned and costs her physically and in risk, not just rhetorically.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—mapping plants to scars is a viscerally particular coping mechanism. Motivation (to “correct” survival, then to anchor optimism in realism) is clear and drives each micro-choice along the path. Contradictory impulses—clinging to the photo vs. pressing it into the tree and then letting it go—are dramatized rather than stated. The final covenant feels earned from prior behavior, with a visible cost in relinquishing the photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s grief, artistic obsession, and self-annihilating drive are vivid and specific (“With tarot shard for brush and grief for ink…”), and his successive choices—to seek the box, to redesign the cards, to step through the mirror—are all motivated and coherent. His interiority is embodied through how he reads the environment as metaphor (coastlines, tides, absence) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction (the desire both to recover his beloved’s face and to surrender to “necessary darkness”) is present but could be sharpened into more active on-page conflict rather than mostly rhetorical musing. The final renunciation—choosing the drowning door over survival—is earned and costly, but his psychology stays largely within one lyrical register of grief without much modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation (find Lyra, resolve the temporal mystery that has cost him his family) is clear and consistently drives each choice, culminating in his decision to follow her into the ink. Interiority is present and specific (“serene anger,” shifting to acceptance), though his inner conflict could be sharper—he accepts the cost of vanishing a bit too smoothly for maximum emotional complexity. The family history (mother and sister both vanished) gives his choice believable weight without feeling like stock backstory. Relationship dynamics are mostly off-page but still felt through how he reads Lyra’s trail and theories, which works well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s motives and contradictions are sharply etched: paid guardian of secrets vs. idealist who “accepted endless cold: to preserve every story.” Her bravery is not simple virtue but a choice made under fear of re-freezing and erasure, with embodied stress (shaking hands, pulse, sedation). The decision to re-enter the pod after triggering upheaval is an earned endurance/renunciation with visible cost. A small limitation is that we see no relationship crucible on the page; all opposition is institutional and offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives—honoring both parents and transforming violence into peace—are clear and consistently dramatized through her ritual work. The inheritance conflict (hunter father vs. pacifist mother) is specific and nicely embodied in details like her “senselessly perceptive eyes” contrasted with her chosen vocation. However, her grief and ambivalence feel almost too tidy; there’s little on-page resistance, anger, or irrationality, which softens the sense of real internal cost. The final reconciliation comes smoothly, reading more like confirmation of an existing stance than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives and temperament are sharply drawn—her cool-headedness, history with the goddess, and preference for silence over spectacle all manifest in specific choices like refusing to “show her cry” and instead driving the spike into the loam. Interiority is mostly implied through action and sensory focus rather than explicit thought, which suits the lyric mode. The internal contradiction (desire for divine contact vs. refusal to offer the demanded vulnerability) is present but stays somewhat understated, softening the felt cost. The final acceptance that she must be “a listener willing to become the next beginning” completes a credible, if quiet, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cordelia’s motivation is precise and consistent—redirecting the “orbit of regret” tied to her family’s downfall—and her choices (submitting to the experiment, pushing until the nib breaks) arise cleanly from that drive. Interiority is embedded in images rather than labels (counting “seven hundred thirty orbits”) and her identity conflict (“liar’s daughter” vs. truth-teller) is dramatized through the contradiction-proof ritual. The visible cost—the splintering of her last relic and acceptance that regret will persist, only wider—is legible and earned. Orlan functions as a light but effective relational crucible, his skepticism and reverence sharpening her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tattooist’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices at each menu option feel psychologically grounded. The backstory with the boy and Orion efficiently personalizes the stakes. Contradictory impulses—self-erasure (“BECOME LULLABY”) versus release—are present but could be more explicitly dramatized in moment-to-moment interiority. The final choice reads earned, with a credible emotional cost, though we stay just shy of truly jagged, irrational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to find a livable relationship with impermanence after erasing her life’s work—is clear, specific, and carried through her micro-choices (kneeling to listen, altering the spiral to a line, scattering the mandala, beginning a new piece). Her interiority is textured and embodied via sensory perception (chalk dust on her tongue, lilac unease on her skin), not abstract label-speak. Internal contradiction—wanting meaning yet rejecting permanence—is dramatized rather than stated. The only thing holding this short of elite is a slight absence of concrete biographical or relational pressures that might further complicate her inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Asha is sharply drawn: a former “gentle radical” turned solitary restorer whose interior conflict between universal access and merciful forgetting feels specific and earned. Her motivations track cleanly from the Archive fire through the “Iron Cradle” persona to her final choice to leave and teach others. The embodied detail of her work with tesserae grounds her abstractions. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that all pressure is internal and largely uncontested in-scene, so we never see her worldview directly challenged by another person.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ghost’s desire for an encore/possibility is clear, specific, and drives every choice, and his emotional life is embodied through sensory-crossed perceptions rather than labels. Internal contradiction (applause vs. “possibility,” nostalgia vs. despair) is present but mostly implicit rather than dramatized in difficult micro-choices. Lila’s presence briefly sharpens his self-knowledge, and the final bow reads as a genuine, earned shift. I’d like one more moment of explicit friction—hesitation or cost—in his choice to solidify into the “young actor who had first died for an encore.”

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to restore privacy to telepathy-pill sufferers via the geode’s patterns—is clear and consistent, and her competence reads believably. However, she encounters little real resistance, and her emotional progression from “affectionate skepticism” to “willowglass hope” is asserted more than tested. Internal contradiction is minimal: she is uneasy about telepathy conceptually but never has to confront a situation where helping others costs her something tangible. The final stance feels earned enough for this length, but not deeply conflicted or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aera’s core drive—to be “the voice of the unknown before the oceans swallowed every echo”—is clear and consistently motivating, and her choice to press the fossil to her sternum reads as a real, costly act of commitment. Interiority is concrete and sensorial rather than labeled, and the collapse at the end shows embodied cost. However, her inner contradictions (fear vs compulsion, loneliness vs duty) remain mostly implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. A touch more on-page friction or hesitation at the pivotal choice would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hourglass turner’s motive—refusing fatalism and “unscrambl[ing]” prophecy—is clear, specific, and expressed through concrete, idiosyncratic behavior (button cataloging). Her shift from measuring out lives to enabling collaborative future-making is credible and earned by the work she does overnight. Internal contradiction is quieter but present: she honors prophecy and monastic tools even as she subverts their use. The main limitation is that her emotional risk and potential regret remain more implied than viscerally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The burned spy’s guilt, damage, and cautious professionalism are specific and coherent, and his shift from “prudent to the point of paralysis” to “prudently daring” is well earned by his history with Sera and the betrayal. His interiority is concrete—pillbox, scar tissue, snowdrop—rather than abstract labels, and his final choice to expose himself and destroy the pillbox clearly forecloses a path with cost. The internal conflict between self-erasure and reparative action is present, though it could surface in a sharper moment of hesitation or temptation to walk away. Overall, this reads as a fully inhabited, particular consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman is psychologically coherent and his final choice—to accept the loss of his vocation and carry the droplet—feels earned by his long history and the girl’s proposition. His interiority is more implied through images than directly dramatized, but we feel a credible before/after shift from functionary to self-possessed carrier of stories. The girl is more archetype than child, yet her role as embodied promise is consistent and legible. What’s missing at a top tier is any sharply rendered moment of contradictory impulse or visible resistance under pressure; the acceptance comes smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lin is vivid and particular—her potter’s mindset, way of reading sun and soot, and calm engagement with the oasis all feel specific rather than generic mystic. Her agency is clear in choosing to shape the clay hive and use the lantern glass, and her refusal to look back at the end reads as an earned stance. Internal contradiction (zen acceptance vs. active intervention) is present but under-dramatized; we see little genuine friction or doubt on the page. The emotional cost of carrying this work forward rather than staying to tend the oasis could be shaded more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motives are vivid and coherent—her mix of rule-consciousness and defiant care (“this was not theft but translation”) drives every choice. Her emotional life is embodied through action and image rather than labels, and the promise to the boy ties her small rebellion to a concrete ethical stake. The boy remains mostly an emblematic presence rather than a fully individuated character, which slightly limits relational complexity. The closing endurance—remaining a clandestine gardener while accepting risk—feels earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gryphon’s motivation—“to translate isolation into independence”—is lucid and consistently dramatized, especially in her refusal of the stone circle’s offer and the etching of “Alone.” Internal conflict between seductive connection and self-preservation is well-rendered in lines like “The awakening was brittle…threatening to shatter if she moved too quickly.” The final choice to step off the stones and later choose the blank codex feels earned and costly, not convenient. A slight limitation is that her contradictions could be pushed even further into messier irrationality under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghostwriter’s core contradiction—professionally articulating others’ love while having “no envelope to call home”—is specific and drives every choice. Her actions with the twig, submission to the installation, and the final bench inscription all emerge cleanly from that history and longing. The internal shift from ghosting others’ voices to claiming “I am here” feels earned and carries a legible cost in relinquishing her previous stance as pure keeper of others’ secrets. The only limitation is that her ambivalence under pressure is more implied than dramatized in on-page hesitation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s motivation is vivid and coherent—scientific responsibility fused with personal unease—and her tactics under pressure feel specific to her training and temperament. Embodied reactions (“velvet migraine,” “subsonic tremor in her chest”) keep her from becoming a pure competence fantasy. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (fear vs resolve, doubt vs hubris) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page hesitation or missteps, so the emotional cost of her choices stays a bit cool. Nonetheless, her final stance—hopeful but unsentimental about power plays resuming—reads as an earned, character-driven endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arin’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: a claustrophobic who has deliberately trained herself to endure tight spaces, and a “prudently adventurous” explorer whose maps and rituals push against her fear. Her motivation (to retrieve the key and end the fallow period) is clear and consistently drives micro-choices, from staying despite organ-induced panic to entering the impossible shaft. The final decision—accepting the tunnels’ closure and symbolically “sealing” her claustrophobia—feels earned and costly. The only minor limit is that her flaw never leads to a misstep or near-failure on the page, which would have deepened the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Juniper’s motivation—to recover erased faces by awakening empathy—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, especially the blood-on-ribbon ritual and the act of finally painting the babysitter. Her face-blindness as both curse and mercy creates a rich internal contradiction that pays off when she realizes the mind has protected her from the loved, broken face. Emotional responses are embodied and character-particular (“mist clung…like guilt,” cutting her own palm, feeling the quarry’s mist dissolve thread by thread). The only minor limit is that the detective remains more symbol than fully pressured character, though his brief presence still works.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—from requesting exile to confronting Voss and ultimately choosing to stay despite her appeal’s success. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (the copper nail, the stench, the storms), and her legacy-driven drive feels particular rather than generic. Internal contradiction (wanting reversal yet choosing continued exile) lands, though much of her path is resolute rather than under real moral duress. Voss is sketched efficiently as a secondary character whose own loss turns him from obstacle to ally in a credible way.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fiddler’s motivation—to reconfigure “never” into “maybe,” haunted by her father’s fall—lands as specific and coherent, and her final choice to take the hitchhiker’s hand feels earned. The internal conflict between fear (father’s death, tarp snap) and desire (amnesty, possibility) is dramatized rather than told. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory perception of wind, tarps, and sound. A slightly more grounded glimpse of her ordinary self beyond the mythic register could deepen the sense of a real person under the lyric surface.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jonah’s motives (returning to the train, interrogating his father’s legacy, clinging to the foreign notes) are clear and particular, and his conceptual shift about loops and borders feels earned by the ritual he enacts with Mara. The detail of the highway robber father and the delivery-startup history gives him a non-generic texture. Internal conflict—wanting to understand the loop yet also to break from it—runs under the scene, though it’s rendered more in conceptual language than in embodied, in-the-moment hesitation. Mara is sketched efficiently and credibly as a quiet counterpoint, but her inner stakes remain thinner than Jonah’s.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chronicler’s motive (to witness/translate the inscriptions before the star dims) and her gift of healing with words are clear and consistent, and the realization that she is “the chronicler, but also the chronicled” gives her a credible internal turn. However, her interior struggle is relatively smooth; contradictory impulses and real resistance are only lightly implied (e.g., insomnia, swallowed stories) rather than dramatized in scene. The boy functions more as a symbolic witness than as an active pressure on her choices, though his final speaking of her name is a strong relational beat. The cost—reconfiguring her relationship to grief—is real but could be sharpened with more visible ambivalence or failure before transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Briar’s interiority is specific, embodied, and morally fraught: her desire to keep the trees “singing only to me” coexists with genuine remorse. Her guardedness is dramatized rather than told—she speaks “only to things that could not answer,” and that flaw both caused the past atrocity and shapes the present ritual. The final confession feels fully earned by the accumulation of prior choices and self-deception, with a visible cost in status and self-concept. There are no safety hedges; the piece allows her to be truly culpable.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—the long-running quest for the “intersection of dreams” and the obligation to the covenant—and it culminates in a costly, earned renunciation when the narrator chooses to stay and graft with the maze. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“lungs fizzing with anxious elation,” scars itching as antenna), and the simultaneous pull of fear vs visionary duty is present on the page. The character is somewhat archetypal (more functionally “visionary” than individuated person), which slightly limits the depth of contradiction and biographical specificity. Still, the final choice tracks cleanly from earlier motives and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the narrator’s war trauma and tentative hope play convincingly against Lira’s mix of care and recklessness. The core moral choice—surrendering the mother’s humming—feels fully motivated and conflicted in the moment. Their relationship is a clear crucible, with status and power shifting subtly once Lira pays a price. If anything, the narrator’s reflective articulation at the end veers slightly toward tidy insight, softening the messiness of his internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mason’s characterization is rich, particular, and consistent, from the roadie details to his ledger habit and humiliation on the courthouse steps. His motives—clinging to provenance, missing applause, fearing obsolescence—credibly drive each choice. The internal shift from seeking external validation to valuing “resonance inside the chest” is mostly earned by prior set-up. The only small weakness is how quickly the closing self-knowledge crystallizes relative to the single present-time scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—reestablishing the archive and reworking her mother’s disappearance—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her methodical choices (planting the seed, translating, humming the lullaby). Her kindly, meticulous temperament both equips her for the work and makes the scale of the task feel overwhelming (“lantern flickering against an avalanche”), which gives her interiority bite. The grief over her mother and the professional calling intertwine credibly, and the final acceptance of “haunted ambitions” as a form of love feels earned. A shade more on-page resistance or doubt at the key ritual moments could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s motivation—to preserve wonder for unnamed children—feels specific and drives every choice, and her internal contradiction (archivist vs. migrating identity) is cleanly embedded in images like the hollow shaped like tomorrow. However, her emotional life remains largely implicit and stylized; we see duty and acceptance more than felt ambivalence or strain in the moment. The closing choice to plant the creel and then leave for “the next routine” reads as an earned endurance rather than a turn, but the cost of that endurance is understated rather than sharply dramatized. This keeps her a powerful figure of idea more than a fully lived, pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically revealed—her confession about “living rooms where no one speaks” retrofits her entire vocation and choice to slip away. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with fear of intimacy and hunger for connection in productive tension. Her final transformation into a witnessing presence is earned by the sequence of micro-choices (leaving the convoy, entering, confessing, accepting the crown). The only limit is that her internal resistance in the midsection is relatively muted, giving her arc a slightly pre-ordained feel.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s characterization is vivid, specific, and internally conflicted—guilt-ridden yet “truth-seeking,” both methodical and impulsive in abandoning medication. Her river-obsession, cartographic thinking, and relationship to her father’s accordion all feel psychologically grounded. The final renunciation (letting the accordion go, choosing a new “bearing”) is credibly earned by prior beats. The only small limitation is that her final clarity about forgiveness edges toward tidy insight rather than something slightly more ragged or resistant.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The veiled dreamer’s motivation (reclaiming her stolen voice / seeking the unspoken words) is clear and consistently drives her movement through the library. Her internal life is implied more than directly dramatized, but details like the stolen watch and mouth sewn with golden thread lend specificity and embodied cost. The final decision to unpick the thread and become the library feels earned by the prior bargain and her navigation work. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper moment-to-moment contradiction (e.g., fear vs. desire) rendered in on-page interior conflict rather than in concept.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motives and contradictions are sharply etched: a principled provenance researcher pulled into outright sabotage, torn between professional non-intervention and the temptation to rewrite history. Her emotional life is embodied and particular (“mulberry ache,” bow “trembling like a question mark”), and her final choice to play feels earned by the prior buildup of guilt, vision, and plant pressure. The plant telepathy and archivist mindset mesh into a distinct psychology rather than a grab bag of quirks. There’s room for slightly deeper sense of her past complicity in empire, but within this length the characterization feels strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s vocation, grief history, and obsessive ritual are sharply etched, and her final self-sacrificial move clearly grows from those traits. Motivation (to preserve sparks/memory against oblivion) is consistent and credible. Internal contradiction (clinging to wonder vs. exhaustion/self-erasure) is present but more implied than dramatized in simultaneous impulses on the page. The closing realization about the spark being her own is earned but could be even more crushing if her reluctance or fear surfaced more viscerally before she steps into the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caretaker’s grief, guilt, and impulse to flee vs. return are richly embodied in concrete memories (the emptied cradle, the sister at the gate) and in her physical choices (climbing up, then choosing to descend). Motivation is clean and consistent: she wants escape/contentment but is bound to the valley’s wound and debt. The relationship with the sister is mostly off-stage yet still reads as specific through a few sharp images. The only slight limitation is that her interior contradiction is powerfully implied rather than fully dramatized in real-time beats of hesitation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s role as a “conscience-for-hire” is sharply defined, and her interior conflict between professional containment and genuine moral unease is convincingly dramatized (especially when her “cloak of doubt” feels threadbare). Her micro-choices—recording chimes, how she frames the final choice to the geologist—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The researchers are lightly sketched but distinct as a collective: sincere in their wish to be justified yet complicit in harm. The ending renunciation (she refuses to fully anesthetize them, offers naked truth instead) feels earned and forecloses the path of easy self-exoneration.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and history are sharply etched—her backward aging, lifelong research, and ethic of withholding truth feel coherent and specific—but Marcus reads more as a vessel for revelation than as a fully conflicted person. His “desperation” is told rather than deeply embodied, and he mostly observes rather than struggles on the page. The emotional cost of Elara’s final choice is intellectually powerful but only lightly dramatized in her body and psyche. Strong, but not yet at the depth or messiness of elite literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cael’s longing to resolve the “pulse left wandering” and to “navigate without moving” is clear, consistent, and realized in the final fusion with the arrowhead. His interiority is filtered through ritual and perception rather than direct emotional naming, which fits the mode but flattens contradictions—he rarely seems torn or genuinely at risk. The grandmother thread adds texture to his motivation but remains idealized; we don’t see a shadow side to his reverence. The final acceptance of stasis as home feels earned but largely frictionless, with little sense of a path foreclosed beyond continued wandering.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s mixture of shame, stubbornness, and quiet yearning is specific and consistent, and his choices (stepping onto the mist, refusing both guild and spire, sacrificing his badge) all grow credibly from that core. Failure as “a credential the automated world never scanned” is an excellent character-particular insight that drives his tactics. Internal conflict—security versus unmetered wonder—is present and tested rather than merely stated. The ending renunciation (stranding himself but accepting “dim moments no drone could meter”) feels earned and carries a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Jin’s motivation (to discover the color of sound) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—leaving the ladder, diving, opening the safe—align with that drive. However, his interior conflict and emotional contradiction are underdeveloped; there’s little sense of fear, guilt about abandoning his post, or competing loyalties. The moment when he chooses to leave his duty as lamplighter could carry more cost on the page. His realization at the end is earned conceptually but not deeply complicated by personal flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation (to align with purpose despite “stellar doubt”) is clear and consistently dramatized through concrete micro-choices like casting comet-bone lots, arranging coins, and ultimately swallowing them. The internal conflict between quiet enthusiasm and annihilating doubt runs through the piece and credibly culminates in her sacrifice. However, her interiority leans conceptual rather than deeply idiosyncratic or embodied, which keeps her just shy of fully three-dimensional. The final renunciation of her “lots decision maker” identity is earned but could carry more visceral, character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The reaper has clear, specific interiority—his mix of numb professionalism and shocked self-recognition (“he had never considered himself worthy of sacrifice, only of endings”) feels earned. His key choices (tracing the tentacle, smashing the cylinders, folding and releasing the paper souls, stepping onto starlight) all reveal shifting values under pressure. The inner conflict between seeing himself as mere function and as someone implicated in sacrifice is credible and continuous. A slight distance in psychic access keeps his emotional texture from being fully maximal, but what’s there is rich.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation—an earnest, slightly misguided belief that he can restore the vanished sea—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (staying seven days, then a lifetime) align with that. The “lukewarm mage” limitation is a strong character-defining constraint that never gets conveniently forgotten. Interiority is fairly spare but effective, more archetypal than psychologically intricate, which limits the sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. His final endurance (devoting his life to the drip) feels earned, though it reads as mythic constancy rather than a complex internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s characterization is rich and coherent: a disciplined, “precisely humane” warden whose professional vigilance intersects with intensely personal history as the town resurfaces. Her internal conflict between duty, grief, and loyalty to her parents is dramatized in concrete acts (pocketing the label, gathering the prints, starting her own photographic trail). The final renunciation—tearing the label and choosing communal memory over private scandal—is clearly earned by what we’ve seen of her values and past.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation (to reconcile logic and wonder) is clear and consistent, and her choices—seeking the orchard, performing the ritual, dissolving the crystal—track well with that drive. Interiority is vivid and particular (“singing the prime numbers in descending order”), and her history with her teacher and mother adds texture. The internal conflict between reason and intuition is present but rarely bites hard; her final decision comes with relatively little on-page hesitation, softening the sense of cost. Still, the closing reorientation of her axis is earned by prior set-up and feels credible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—the duty to preserve trust and guard the sky—and the internal conflict between vigilance and the need to let go is credibly dramatized. Embodied details like the scratches on the buckle and the remembered wrist-taps ground her interiority. The final choice to hand over the buckle feels earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. A slight tendency toward abstraction in phrasing (“trust under pressure,” “watcher’s burden”) keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara and Zero are sharply etched as complementary fragments of one self, with clear, opposing paths (attachment vs detachment) and a shared, specific wound. Motivation is strong and consistent: Mara’s drive to escape numbness and Zero’s resignation converge credibly in the choice to merge rather than compete. The custody ritual forces them into micro-choices—what to confess, when to challenge—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Some emotions remain slightly abstract (“ache of absence”) rather than fully embodied, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is vivid and particular—a designer devoted to “safeguard[ing] space for innovation”—and her actions (planting the seed, choosing to guide its growth) track cleanly with that motive. However, internal conflict is underplayed: the terror of trapping guests forever versus her reverence for the labyrinth never fully clashes on the page, so the core choice feels more graceful than costly. Embodied emotion appears (“pulse matched the distant approaching storm”) but often yields quickly to conceptual language. The final acceptance of mutating with the building reads earned but relatively low-friction for the apocalyptic stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellery’s grief, hope, and self-awareness are rendered with concrete, particular detail (leaf-blower “symphony conductor,” marble-laughter), and his core action—taking the blower to the tunnel and modulating it—is clearly motivated by the need to recontact his daughter. His internal contradiction (knowing the sound is impossible yet chasing it anyway) plays out credibly in scene. The final endurance—accepting that what returns is shape, not the dead—feels earned and costly. Only minor constraint: we get little textured sense of his relationship with his wife beyond the single, late chuckle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s motives—guarding knowledge, dimensional homesickness, and her disciplined project of “making friends with uncertainty”—are clear and consistently dramatized. Her major choices (not crossing, relinquishing the pendant, returning to frost) feel like an earned stance shaped by long habit and prior experience (stopping the cultist by waiting). Internal conflict between longing for the other garden and loyalty to her role is present but mediated mostly through concept rather than raw, embodied feeling, which slightly mutes emotional impact. Still, she reads as specific and non-generic, with a believable, if stylized, psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and specific—he steals the crozier “to interrupt a stifling destiny”—and his willingness to pay with blood and sight tracks cleanly to that drive. Interiority is vivid and particular (ledger as “cold bloom of data where hope should have been”), and his final renunciation of vision feels earned. What’s missing for the very top band is a sharper sense of simultaneous, in-scene contradiction: his doubt or fear is gestured at via “hopeless” but rarely dramatized as an active counter-impulse. The relationship with the staff-creature is intriguing but underdeveloped as a crucible; it mainly functions as embodiment of his creed rather than a counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The interpreter’s vocation and mandate give her clear, specific motivation, and her choices (discarding assumptions, sacrificing the fragment, reinterpreting the shard) are coherent and earned. However, she remains more archetypal than individuated; we don’t glimpse much biography, contradictory desire, or idiosyncratic flaw beyond her role. The emotional turn—fear of the shard to recognition of it as cocoon—lands, but the inner conflict is fairly smooth rather than sharply torn. A touch more personal cost or irrational resistance at the peak would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Arden’s characterization is vivid and particular—his off-key humming, denial vocabulary (“slipping sideways”), and attachment to the hourglass all cohere into a specific psyche under pressure. His motivation (save the ferry, passengers, and his own chance at belonging) intensifies cleanly toward the costful choice. The internal conflict—choosing which timeline to sacrifice—is present but resolved relatively swiftly, with less messy ambivalence than the setup could sustain. Still, the final choice feels earned and in-character, with his resilient refusal of binary loss driving the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The architect has a clear, consistent motivation and a defined role in the space, but her interiority remains largely conceptual rather than embodied or conflicted. Her “unsettling calm” never truly strains against fear, doubt, or attachment, so the final realization (“she was the thread, the pattern, the space between”) feels more like completion of an idea than a hard-won change with visible cost. The composite man works more as an abstract mouthpiece than as a relational crucible that forces difficult choices. Strong concept of self as creator/creation, but little on-page emotional struggle limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The instructor is sharply etched: competent, grieving, ethically rigorous, with her refusal to lie to the boy and her gift of the chain link as clear value-laden choices. The boy is thinner but still functions as a believable vessel for generational hope and fear (“whose parents still stared at the sealed surface hatch”). Internal contradiction—hope vs. resignation—is present but could be embodied more viscerally rather than mostly via declarative wisdom. Still, the final renunciation of the link reads earned and costly for her.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—from professional ethics about “vulnerable voices” to the small illicit thrill that made her choose tracing over medicine. Her persistence and capacity for strategic lying under pressure feel earned by prior beats, and the final renunciation of the hearing aid lands as a credible, costly shift. Hask’s guilt and collapse read as psychologically plausible despite limited interior access, but his on-page resistance is brief enough that the confrontation feels slightly easy. A touch more embodied contradiction in Mira at the climax (fear vs. duty vs. self-preservation) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation—to stand by the unremembered despite crippling claustrophobia—is clear, consistent, and tested throughout the descent, with embodied fear (“crawling through a throat of stone”) playing against her chosen duty. Her micro-choices (following the gold, speaking each name, placing her hand over Voss’s) reveal a strong hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction (panic vs obligation) is present in action rather than explained. Secondary characters are necessarily thin but still individualized enough through their deaths/entombments to register as distinct witnesses rather than props.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and particular—mechanical heartbeat, digital ghosthood, and ambivalence toward survival all feel integrated and motivated. His goal (“fetch wisdom from failure”) clearly drives the night’s ritual and the visit to the clerk, with a credible cost in stepping back into frail, uncertain life. The brief on-page interaction with the clerk reveals a sharp status and emotional shift but she remains more a function than a fully realized person. The final choice to return the “midnight solace” reads earned by prior beats, not tacked-on.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The storyteller’s core motivation—to save the river-tongue from extinction even at the cost of her life—is clear, consistent, and propels every choice. Her fear of the curse versus fear of silence gives a genuine internal tension, though the piece prioritizes mythic scope over fine-grained psychological contradiction. Embodied reactions (copper veins rattling, heart slowing to fossil tempo) keep emotion concrete within the conceit. The final renunciation—swallowing the diamond—feels fully earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s professional motive (debunk vs. investigate) and deeper drive (bitterness, desire for transformation) are clear and consistently expressed, and her final choice to fuse with the cryptid feels earned. However, her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see a sharp on-page struggle at the decision point, so the loss of her human life reads thematically but not viscerally costly. Interiority is vivid and particular (“bitter chill of betrayal,” childhood nickname) and avoids stock emotion labels. The arc from skeptic/agent to willing participant in “harmony untamed” is coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Calla’s motive—“to uproot the last seed of beauty”—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices, and her use of the gardener’s rhythm shows focused, competent agency. However, she faces little genuine inner contradiction or doubt on the page; the “gap between knowing and understanding” is named but not dramatized as conflicting impulses. Emotional response is mostly displaced into imagery rather than concrete, idiosyncratic interior beats, which keeps her slightly abstract. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving without looking back, becoming rumor) is resonant but not sharply felt as a costly sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Riven’s motivation—to become a mailman in order to intercept devoured letters and learn where broken promises heal—is vivid and coherent, and his choices (using the storm on the cabinet, feeding coins into the “wrong” machine, trading weather for words) all track cleanly from that drive. Interiority is largely shown through embodied perception (letters pressing against his ribs, the bottle’s light, the smell of the tunnel) rather than label-only emotion. The “respectfully rebellious” contradiction is intriguing but could be dramatized with more explicit inner friction or a moment of genuine doubt under pressure. The closing acceptance of cost (giving up the storm, knowing the route will close) feels earned but could cut deeper with sharper articulation of what he’s sacrificing beyond the symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carpenter’s motivation—to test the rumor and reinterpret silence as possibility—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his choices, from entering the train to touching the halo and then choosing to walk on without looking back. His interiority is shown through craft-focused memories and sensory associations rather than abstract labels, which makes him feel particular. The change at the end (carrying the halo’s promise and deliberately taking a “wrong turn”) is earned and forecloses his prior erasure without being overexplained. A slightly sharper on-page contradiction (e.g., a moment of real reluctance or urge to flee) could have deepened his internal conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ms. Penumbra is vivid and particular, with a clear long-term quest and a tactile relationship to the scarf and the shelves, but she experiences almost no on-page ambivalence or competing impulses. Her realization of her role feels earned yet emotionally smooth, with little visible cost or resistance. The “sanely eccentric” aspect remains more label than dramatized contradiction. Overall she reads as compelling but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mireya’s motivation is vivid and specific—the runaway dream and cipher of longing clearly drive every choice—but her internal conflict stays mostly implied rather than dramatically torn on the page. We feel her “hollowed by absence” and willingness to risk a nameless memory, yet we don’t see much moment-by-moment wavering when the cost comes due. Her micro-choices (setting out before dawn, stepping into the tide, snapping the decisive frame) align well with her established traits. The ending embodies an earned endurance—she resumes shelving hush changed—but that cost could be rendered more viscerally in her body and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith’s longing, fear, and professional history are embodied in concrete images (hair, ribbon, gates), and her final renunciation (“surrender the name, keep the longing”) is deeply motivated by the build-up. Internal conflict between safety and expression is present on the walk through erased years and at the mirror, where she explicitly weighs the cost of anonymity. Her decisive choice to break the mirror and accept the scar reads earned and costly. The only limit is that we glimpse primarily one dimension of her life (art/voice) rather than a fuller tangle of flaws or competing loyalties.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s curiosity, fear of pain, and longing for her past are all dramatized through concrete micro-choices (entering, kneeling, lifting the sextant, choosing the scalpel). The realization that her memories were “offered” rather than taken reframes her flaw (habitual forgetting) in a way that clearly motivates the climactic refusal to complete the exchange. Embodied details—trembling gloved fingers, the ache that “quiet[s]” when she picks up the sextant—keep emotions grounded rather than abstract. The cost of her choice (accepting the full pain of recovered memory) is implicit but could be pushed one notch more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivations (refusal to forget, duty to the library, desire to mentor) are specific and consistently dramatized, and her final choice to rewrite the exile rather than sacrifice herself directly feels earned. The reversible exile dilemma gives her a real internal conflict between home, memory, and responsibility. The child is sketched efficiently and their understanding of mentorship lands, though their inner life is necessarily thin at this length. Emotional embodiment leans image-heavy rather than bodily, but the images feel character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Arin’s motivation—to preserve and then reconceive “the color of wonder” as something to be shared—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in his choices (building the loom, then choosing to let the color travel). His occupation and inherited craft feel embodied rather than labeled, and his tools and rituals reveal character well. However, internal contradiction is underplayed: he pivots from trapping to releasing wonder with relatively little on-page friction or emotional struggle. The emotional register stays largely in the mythic/lyric rather than giving us more granular, bodily cues under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s vocation, sensory way of relating to masks, and quiet, dutiful temperament are specific and consistent, and his work on the net clearly reveals him under pressure. His motivation to “ground” spirits is emotionally legible, and the moment he realizes his calling has shifted from repairing objects to releasing voices feels earned. However, we see relatively little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle—he moves competently through the ritual without much hesitation or error. The fisherman is effective but thinly sketched, functioning more as a vessel for backstory than a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to treat silence as a language rather than emptiness—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice from setting up the projectors to stepping through the door and refusing to “translate” what she finds. Her interiority is richly particular (“she trusted maps because they confessed their limits with blankness”) and her small but real shift—from investigative control to witnessing without capture—reads earned. Internal contradiction (trust in mapped limits vs. attraction to unmapped Silence) is present but could be dramatized under more pressure rather than mostly conceptualized. The cost of her final stance is quiet but legible in the loss of footage and tools, and in her acceptance that she will not see the map mend.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation and inner conflict are sharply drawn—her compulsion to quantify “the physics of letting go” versus her buried personal stake in 1914—and her final renunciation feels earned and costly. Elias/Death works well as an intimate, low-pressure foil whose single key intervention (“not aerodynamic but contractual”) reorients her. Emotional texture is embodied and specific (field notes, trembling glove, pressure gauges) rather than generic. The only slight limitation is that the ancestral trauma is revealed and processed very quickly, doing a lot of work in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motive—to encode unspoken needs before they’re erased—is specific and consistent, and the appearance of her echo gives her a credible internal antagonist. The tension between “encoding us away” and wanting delivery of those needs provides some genuine contradiction. However, interiority stays mostly at the level of image-rich description rather than thorny, moment-to-moment emotional calculus, so her final repricing reads a touch smooth. The echo dissolving into moths is affecting but feels more symbolic than psychologically wrestled-through.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s curiosity, class position, and capacity for joy are rendered with concrete, particularized detail, and her choices (putting on the goggles, decoding the diary, choosing the seed over duty) feel fully motivated. The transition from “servant ascending” to someone who stays below to “water the future” is an earned character shift with visible cost (abandoning her expected role and reporting line). Interior conflict is mostly implicit (duty vs curiosity vs grief/joy) and could be sharpened on the page once or twice with more contradiction under pressure. Secondary characters (duke’s son, boiler stoker) are brief but effectively used to refract her nature rather than deepen relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—preserving her mother’s theory so nothing is forgotten—is vivid and consistent, and her fear of forgetting over falling is a strong, character-specific drive. Interiority is concrete (“tastes like burnt coffee and airport goodbyes”), and her lineage through grandmother/mother is cleanly embedded. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (quieter temperament vs. “explosive” resolve) rather than deeply dramatized in micro-choices. The final renunciation—stepping out into space—is emotionally earned but could register with slightly more on-page ambivalence or doubt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and specific—use her last hours in the guild’s sanctuary to create a final work that encodes what she alone can perceive. Prosopagnosia is well integrated into her worldview (e.g., reading shoulders and hands instead of faces) and shapes her artistic choices. Internal change—from seeing her condition as deficit to filter—is earned through the coin’s riddle and the act of painting. The main limitation is a relative lack of contradictory impulses under pressure; she rarely feels truly torn between staying, fleeing, or defying the demolition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s curiosity, outsider status, and grief-anchored attachment to her mother’s scrap are cleanly motivated and drive her choices from chart-room to cargo deck to engine galley. Her emotional life is particular (“invited everywhere and nowhere”) and embodied without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction (longing for belonging vs. comfort in solitary roaming) is present but lightly dramatized rather than deeply tested. The final shift—from marginal to acknowledged—feels earned, though the personal cost remains relatively modest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rowan’s desire “to learn the rhythm of repair” is precise, emotionally rooted in grief for his mentor, and consistently drives his behavior from first step off the lift to entering the workshop. His internal tension—competence vs. fear of repeating failure—shows in the failed gear-testing sequence and the moment he risks using the broken key. The final choice to step into the mentor’s workshop and accept the door vanishing reads as an earned shift from haunted apprentice to committed custodian. The only constraint at this length is that his contradictory impulses (terror vs. desire) could be embodied a touch more viscerally under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s altruism, lingering attachment, and doubt about being trusted are clear and consistent, and her choices (dew messages, guiding the harvest, accepting departure) track well with those motives. Kai has just enough specificity (once-lonely engineer, coffee as soft leadership) to feel like more than a pawn. What’s missing for top-tier is sharper interior contradiction—Mara rarely feels genuinely torn, so the emotional cost of letting go is more stated than deeply dramatized. Still, the arc from tethered helper to released presence is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The adjuster’s motivation—protecting the lullaby and, by extension, the world—stays coherent and deepens as her past (the nursery, the bombs) reframes her present duty. Interiority is specific and embodied, with genuine ambiguity around whether salvation is worth the personal cost (“as if to ask whether salvation was worth finishing the song”). The final acceptance—remaining as the pane’s backing—is clearly earned and costly. Internal contradiction (duty vs the desire for an unwrecked life) is present but could surface in sharper, more explicitly conflicted micro-choices earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s reluctance, competence, and trapped compassion come through clearly in her actions (the warmth-ghosts, the nut, her refusal to turn toward the orchard). Motivation is clean and consistent: she hates the orchard but is compelled to save strangers. Internal contradiction is present but mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in on-page turmoil. The Earned Stasis of returning to her prison reads emotionally credible and grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt, competence, and grief-driven inventiveness are sharply etched, and her professional mindset (thinking in polymers and lattices) is organically fused to her emotional life. The refusal of the final call and her need to atone give her motives weight and specificity. Her internal conflict—clinging to the husk versus releasing it into a communal installation—is credible and resolved with visible cost when she leaves the sculptures behind. The only slight limit is that her contradictions under pressure could be dramatized in one or two sharper, on-page moments of hesitation or potential refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vendor has a clear, coherent motivation (selling “clean slates” by quantifying absence), and her choices—pricing, bottling absence, finally drinking the moonlight—drive the piece’s turns. Interiority is implied rather than explicit, but the actions (e.g., trading the librarian’s ability to forget indexes) reveal a distinct worldview. The boy and the librarian apply specific relational pressure that exposes her role as both merchant and destabilizer of narrative. The final self-subtraction is earned conceptually, though it lands more as idea than deeply embodied emotional cost, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s core drive—to “sandpaper rough memories clean”—is clear and consistently refracted through her sensory gift and cooking vocabulary, and her final shift in stance toward grief feels earned. Her embodied reactions to the coral’s vast memories (“her knees buckled”) keep emotions grounded rather than abstract. The internal conflict between her desire to cleanse and the land’s desire to be remembered gives her arc texture, though the personal cost of her transformation could be dramatized a touch more concretely. Overall she reads as specific, not generic, with a coherent hierarchy of values anchored in taste and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mireya is distinctive and motivated—“empathetically decisive” is dramatized in her immediate commitment to fix the tower and soothe the elevator. We see her competence, vocation, and care, but almost no internal contradiction or genuine doubt under pressure. Her exhaustion at the end gestures toward cost, yet her success feels assured from early on, so her emotional arc is more graceful fulfillment than strained transformation. Relationships are essentially between her and personified systems rather than people, which keeps the crucible gentler.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s obsession, history with the canyon, and willingness to risk cognitive annihilation are clear and particular, with her “helix mind” and “chaotically precise” habits giving her an idiosyncratic texture. Motivation is strong and consistent from the first paragraph through her bloodied, determined retreat. Internal contradiction (terror vs compulsion, self-preservation vs devotion to the miners’ dreams) is present but mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in discrete moments of doubt. The final stance—accepting real loss while recommitting to return—is earned and carries a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilyra’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent (restoring the Archive’s memory), and her competence feels grounded in lifelong study. Interiority is embedded in how she reads the grotto and tools rather than in explicit feeling-labels, which works well. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or fear under pressure; she rarely wavers or missteps. The final smile reads earned but low-cost emotionally, keeping this below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ilay’s motivation—to rekindle music in a silent world—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her tactile, careful choices (mapping cracks, matching the tree’s pulse, restraining celebration). Her interiority is vivid and character-particular, filtered through sound and craft rather than generic emotion labels. The main limitation is the relative softness of on-page internal contradiction; doubt or competing impulses are implied but rarely dramatized in tension with her drive. Still, her final, quiet renunciation of overt celebration feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s interiority is specific and consistent—his precision, pedagogical mindset, and fixation on sacrifice all feel unified and character-particular. His motivation (to reinterpret exile, to find “beauty in the difficult”) is clear and ties to his history with Lord Ashford. However, the piece mostly presents a single, reflective emotional mode; we see relatively little contradiction or live struggle between impulses, so the final “turn” to purpose lands more as a smooth realization than a hard-won choice. The cost of exile is stated and atmospherically present, but not sharply dramatized in discrete, pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mirelle’s motive—recover the clasp and reinterpret its history of containing pain—is clear and consistent, and her pacifism, guilt, and almost-ritualistic cataloguing give her a distinct psychology. Her emotions are embodied through sensory translations (cedar as truce, iron as surrender) and the way she listens to silences. The final choice to treat the clasp as a broadcast of empathy rather than a lock is credibly earned. Internal contradiction (pacifist steeped in war artifacts, longing for silence but chasing buried screams) could be sharpened on the page but is present.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Myrrh’s motivation—an ambitious desire to astonish via her craft—evolves credibly into a quieter gratitude and renunciation (“she had meant to astonish the village, but instead the village had astonished her”), and every major action (testing the seed, choosing the graft site, gifting the journal) is rooted in that. Her olfactory sensitivity, family customs, and ambition all manifest in concrete micro-choices under pressure rather than labels. The internal contradiction between wanting to move the village and learning to move with it is present and resolved with a felt cost (she gives up her notebook and her need to dazzle). The mother’s brief appearance underlines relational stakes without derailing the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aera’s motivation (to understand the source of resilience) is clear, rooted in her history with blight, and her choices—entering the Silent Core, inserting the arrow tip, offering her memories—track cleanly with that drive. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized; we get more idea and image than textured, contradictory emotion under pressure. She feels highly competent and almost serenely unconflicted, which slightly flattens potential tension in key beats. The final grafting moment is earned, but the personal cost could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply etched as a hyper-competent, almost devotional observer whose motives (“to cultivate foresight in action”) are borne out by her meticulous choices. Her interiority is largely expressed through perception and ritualized action (the patch in her pocket, closing Holm’s eyes) rather than explicit inner conflict, which keeps her a bit cool. The small but clear cost—surrendering the patch and committing to a life of anticipatory listening—reads as an earned stance rather than an epiphany. Deeper contradiction or vulnerability under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation—to retrieve and ultimately embody the amber score so he can defend wonder against the Council—is clear and consistently expressed, and his interiority has specific, character-colored touches (“tasting” his childhood fear and finding it sour). However, his internal conflict is comparatively smooth: he releases fears and “protective scales” almost without resistance, so his final choice to swallow the sheet feels more like a foregone fulfillment than a hard-won, costly turn. The emotional cost is implied rather than deeply dramatized, which slightly blunts the character arc at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen’s drive, guilt, and analytical coldness are all present and consistent, and her final renunciation of the flute feels earned by the prior framing of her failure and exile. The line “driven not by penance but by a colder motive” gives her a specific, non-generic psychology, and the ending reframes that drive with stillness in a credible way. Internal contradiction (driven vs. stillness, keeper vs. exile) is present if mostly carried in concept and image rather than fully dramatized as in-the-moment hesitation. The cost of leaving the flute and the path between worlds is clear and rooted in her traits.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Quince’s interiority is specific and particular—his mix of technical craft, quasi-mystical thinking, and borrowed grief feels distinct and consistent, and the culmination in his sacrificial choice is well motivated by the widow/astronomer tensions. The habitual personality-borrowing creates a credible, character-rooted flaw that drives the core dilemma of self-erasure versus empathy. Emotional states are mostly rendered through concrete, idiosyncratic perception (press as a slow heart, grief like wet newsprint), though sometimes tilt toward conceptual rather than bodily embodiment. The final renunciation of borrowing reads as a genuine change with visible cost, not a tidy, painless insight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—jittery, loyal to Corwin, torn between fear and longing for wonder—and his interiority feels specific (“half terror, half anticipation”). The transformation from courier to legend is conceptually earned but somewhat summarized at the end rather than fully dramatized through concrete, pressured micro-choices. The mysterious woman is mostly an archetypal mouthpiece for theme, with little individual texture. The cost of becoming “part story” is stated more than emotionally inhabited, which slightly blunts the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s motivation—to prove that objects absorb emotions and to transmute his grief—is clear, particular, and consistently drives his choices from placing the prism to leaving it behind. His internal conflict between “letting go” and “I need you still” is well dramatized through the ritual of “truthful lies.” The final renunciation (walking away without the prism) feels earned and carries visible cost. If anything, his inner life is so dominated by the ritual that we get slightly less sense of his broader flaws or life beyond this grief.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The spinner’s interiority is vivid and particular—her fingers remembering before her mind, her embodied reaction to the bead and puzzle—and her final renunciation of voice is a clear, costly choice. Her actions all cohere with a quiet, dutiful temperament that endures rather than rebels. The main limitation is that the deeper motive for carrying a message (“to whom, for what?”) remains abstract, so the sacrifice is emotionally powerful but not fully individualized. That small distance keeps the arc just shy of fully devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thistle’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—meek yet quietly resolved, seeking to refashion a ruined life into something useful and transcendent. His bartered awakening (understanding for confusion) is intriguing but remains more conceptual than dramatized as an active inner conflict. We see determination embodied in his repeated work nights and his final public act with the ladder, but we rarely feel competing impulses or genuine doubt. The transformation from failed blacksmith to “architect of azure defiance” is earned, yet emotionally undercomplex for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sensory map maker is sharply etched through her embodied perceptions and vocation, and her final decision to “chart not places but consequences” feels earned from the accumulated beats of longing, curiosity, and guilt. Her grief over the lover and dawning sense of complicity are specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction—her simultaneous urge to reach the younger self and the shard’s violent correction of that urge—adds tension. The only slight weakness is that the revelation of her role in the cover-up is delivered quickly in exposition rather than being more gradually dramatized through her reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn through behavior and perception—his ritual visits, stone-reading, and the way he “bottles” safety are all character-specific and coherent. His motivation (protecting the tower from forgetting, maintaining the chain) is clear and deepens through the fear that the keeper has died. Internal conflict is quiet but present—duty versus dread, reticence versus longing for contact—culminating in an earned stasis where he continues the chain despite uncertainty. The only reason this isn’t higher is that his contradictory impulses, while there, seldom clash on the page with fully dramatized cost beyond a muted ache.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s core drive and contradiction—wanting only to “steer the night” yet being bound to birth a new dawn—are clear and escalate credibly into acceptance. Her motivations are mythic but coherent, and her key choices (laughing again, pressing the wick to the lens, steering into the blank page) track with those motives. However, interiority remains largely conceptual and symbolic; there is little concrete, embodied emotion under pressure, which slightly distances us from her as a person. The final shift from herald to reader is earned but could land even harder with more tactile, character-particular feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hoshiko’s motivation—to understand why some people “magnetize stories”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her profession and new heart. Her interiority is specific and sensorial rather than diagnostic, and her final renunciation of collecting to become a teacher/guide feels earned. However, internal contradiction is relatively mild; she moves from curiosity to acceptance with little visible resistance or irrational backsliding, which keeps the arc from feeling fully crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is distinct, competent, and grounded in her work; her habits of repair and notation (“Sorrow Index 3.7, unit: rings”) feel character-specific. Motivation is clear—both to fix the sextant and to understand what trees witness—and her choices (climbing in the storm, mapping dreams, deconstructing the instrument) track cleanly with those aims. What’s thinner is active internal contradiction: she encounters little moral or emotional friction as she converts the sextant into a tree. The ending offers a gentle reorientation rather than a hard-won shift, keeping the character arc affecting but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s goal and core trait (scattered memory, stubborn purpose) are clear and consistent, and her major choice—driving the shattered mica into her chest—earns the later coherence and world-shift. However, interior contradiction under peak pressure is relatively thin: she rarely doubts, resents, or miscalculates, so the arc reads more mythic than psychologically contoured. Embodied emotion is vivid (“moths against glass,” phosphor stinging “like remembered joy”), but we see little of her private fear or selfish impulse. The final choice feels motivated and costly, just not as morally or emotionally knotted as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—atoning by “unearth[ing] wisdom in that mistake or die trying”—is clear, and her internal paradox (staying vs. leaving, presence vs. absence) meaningfully shapes every choice through to her self-erasure. Her embodied empathy (tasting borrowers’ emotions) gives her a distinct interior life rather than generic guilt. The final renunciation of her future to become the library’s guardian feels earned by the setup of her mistake and conscience. The only limitation is that her relationship with Vale is more symbolic than pressured, so relational dynamics never fully ignite.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mila’s vocation, perceptions, and choices are specific and coherent, and her shift from “noticer” to active cultivator of memory feels earned. Her interiority is mostly shown through sensory attention and metaphor rather than abstract labels, which works for this lyrical mode. The gardener is lightly sketched but functionally strong, applying direct pressure via the “plant it” instruction and the warning about scrutiny. The main limitation is that Mila’s internal conflict (fear of sealing amnesia vs temptation to use/eat the bread) stays more implied than dramatized in distinct, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The records chief is sharply etched through vocation, temperament (“gently meticulous”), and the way she responds to vanishing virtues. Her motives—measuring what remains of truth and translating grief into data—are coherent and carried through to the final act with the tree. Internal contradiction (need to quantify vs awareness it’s “sweet and meaningless”) is present, if understated. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting that the data will live on as meaningless sap) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with a convincing tangle of impulses—wanting her father to stop her even as she engineers the betrayal—given incisive embodiment (“each stride dying halfway,” the mermaid tail digging half-moons). Her final choice to surrender the fob and accept the recording feels fully earned and costly. Jonah is spare but legible as a steady counterpoint, his calm attention acting as pressure without stealing focus. The only constraint at this length is that the father remains entirely off-page, so the relationship crucible is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skeptic’s core contradiction—rational doubt vs. embodied weather-sense—is clear and thematically apt, and her shift from resistance to acceptance lands. Her motivation (to understand weather-bearers) is explicit and consistent, if somewhat told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The silver-haired woman functions mostly as a catalyst/guide rather than a fully pressured presence, but she does effectively expose the protagonist’s blind spot. The branding moment and tasting her own weather give the arc a concrete, character-specific cost, though the emotional struggle feels relatively smooth and unresisted.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is specific and embodied—iron-and-pennies taste, charcoal-blackened cheeks, the compulsive twitch of her fingers—and her history with her mother and her gift grounds her choices. The core contradiction (mnemonic gift as both livelihood and trap) is clear and drives her down into the cave and into the act of “rectifying” the self-portrait. The shift from fleeing memory to collaborating with it feels earned, with visible cost in relinquishing her old transactional portrait practice. A minor limitation is that her ambivalence under peak pressure could be dramatized with one more concrete on-page hesitation or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s motives (loneliness, disillusionment with language, compulsion toward honesty) are specific and consistent, and her actions—reconstructing the map, leaving her own confession, staying to read the letters—feel earned. Her physical reactions to lies and the curling gilt give her a distinctive, embodied interiority. Corin is thinner but still legible as a quiet counterpart whose shared ache makes their final collaboration believable. The internal change from “ink as lie” to “ink as honest irrigation” is clear and paid for with vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tuner’s motivation—to preserve a vanishing “color of wonder” through her craft and chosen silence—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions. Her seasonal muteness, obsessive tuning, and final, wordless gift to the boy all align as micro-choices that show a coherent hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is quieter (devotion to silence vs. the urge to “crack open” at the comet) but present and believable. The ending reads as an earned renunciation: she leaves the sculpture and her wedges behind, accepting a custodial role with real personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    K-17’s internal contradiction—caretaker protocol vs. illicit nostalgia/longing—is clear, specific, and drives each micro-choice (opening the box, allowing it to merge, “planting” itself). The inner static that becomes “the sound of its own becoming” feels earned rather than declared. Emotional embodiment is good for a machine POV (servos, neural static, weight of the box), though some beats remain more conceptual than sensory. The final renunciation of pure caretaker identity in favor of hybrid being lands with a credible cost but could use one sharper, more concrete moment of doubt or resistance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation and temperament (“curator of every forgotten thing”) are vivid, and her arc from curious investigator to guardian of silence is clean and earned. The key contradiction—her urge to pry open mysteries versus her belief in listening—plays out concretely in the borescope scene and her later refusal to use tools. Emotional life is mostly shown through specific perceptions rather than labels. The only limitation is that her inner conflict could be shaded with one more moment of real temptation or doubt at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation (to complete the drowned scientists’ work and carry the seed) is clear and expressed through specific, embodied choices—decoding, choosing the shaft, swallowing the page. Interiority is mostly inferred via movement and metaphor rather than explicit thought, which works with the piece’s lyric mode. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or visible doubt; she feels almost entirely assured and competent throughout. Her final choice to ingest the cipher is thematically right and motivated, but it doesn’t visibly cost her beyond a warm pressure, which keeps this short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miren’s motivation is clear, specific, and persistent—retrieve her sister’s deleted memories—and her micro-choices (entering the chamber, using the flowers, gathering the dust, returning to her work) all track cleanly to that drive. Interiority is embodied through perception rather than label (“gleaming silence,” “taste of iron and forgetting”), so we feel her emotional state without therapy-speak. The arc from hungry, focused retrieval to accepting a quieter, shared form of memory (“not as loss, but as ballast”) reads as an earned reconfiguration with cost: she doesn’t get her sister back as narrative, only as diffuse sensation. The only slight limitation is the relative absence of contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves with composed purpose more than conflicted struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The summoner’s motives and history are clear and specific—his wandering to “collect hush” and his master’s mind cracked by code give him depth and plausibility. His final choice to swallow the hush sphere registers as a felt cost and an earned extension of his vocation. However, his interiority leans more emblematic than conflicted; we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or real temptation to refuse the burden. That lack of visible inner friction keeps him slightly shy of the most demanding literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s blend of professed goal (learning building-language) and covert loneliness is specific and consistent, and the bargain with the tutor makes their relationship feel lived-in rather than symbolic. The tutor’s revelation about her nature and her gentle, almost bureaucratic handoff of the role are emotionally legible and motivated by the established rules. Interiority is textured through perception choices rather than label-speak, though the emotional reactions stay slightly cool and conceptual rather than fully embodied at key moments (e.g., her vanishing). The final acceptance of the “keeper” role feels earned, with the cost—losing the tutor and gaining the building’s burden—clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives are clear and specific—public debunker vs. private wound—and the tension between “charmed skeptic” and desperate daughter underlies every choice. Her desire “to translate isolation into independence” is dramatized through concrete action, not just asserted. The cost of regaining the memory (sacrificing color vision) registers as an earned, character-driven shift. There is some slightly expository phrasing around her career, but it doesn’t undercut the emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motives (vengeance, guilt, loyalty to her sister, need for self-forgiveness) are clear and consistently dramatized via objects and ritualized actions. Her transformation from forger-of-others to writer-of-self is motivated by long-carrying guilt and the sanctuary’s memories. Internal conflict between justice and self-annihilation appears in lines like “she'd become the very monster she'd sought to destroy,” though it leans on explicit labeling rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The closing choice to leave the thorn and keep the key feels earned and costly, even if some emotional beats are told in abstract terms.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s core motivation—to understand why some people echo and avoid becoming a trapped residue herself—is clear and consistent from early on and culminates in her choice to “finish” her mother’s leaving. Her richly perceptive nature is dramatized (tasting “iron in a stranger's blood memory”) rather than labeled, and it tangibly burdens her. The mother reveal and “blood-memory recognition” add a compelling relational crucible, but the emotional struggle at the climax feels a touch too smooth—she adjusts quickly from shock to functional ritual completion. A bit more embodied contradiction (grief vs. fear of entrapment) in the gallery scene would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marrow’s vocation, methods, and restraint around truth are vivid and consistent, and her motive to “salvage something pure” feels organically tied to who she is. Interiority is conveyed more through externalized images than contradictory impulses under pressure, so we rarely see her torn or degraded by stress. Her final stance—carrying the “pure thing” forward while leaving the mirror—is coherent but not heavily costed on the page. Strong character concept and texture, slightly underdramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The net-mender philosopher’s interiority is vivid and particular, rooted in her reverence for hidden labor and pattern. Her choices—to search in the dark without a lamp, to treat mending as “a conversation with water,” to stay small and necessary—arise organically from that worldview. The “demure audacity” of accepting quiet usefulness rather than grand gesture reads as a credible, earned stance. The change is subtle but legible: she descends with a reconfigured sense that her invisible work sends out “moon paths” others follow.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marisol’s motivation is clear, specific, and tied to a concrete professional past (former conspiracy debunker turned hunter of the same), and her major choices—keeping hold of the diamond, then deciding to hang it—track well with that history. Interiority is vivid and mostly embodied (“tasted copper and shame”) rather than abstract. Internal conflict appears but could be sharpened: her temptation to drop the stone and choose amnesia is only briefly dwelt in, so the push–pull between self-preservation and duty never quite bites as hard as it could. The final renunciation (choosing pain and responsibility) feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—counting lightning strikes, building bombs from radio parts and regret, laughing like “blood from a bitten tongue”—and her choices at the end arise cleanly from that established psyche. Her motivation (to shape a new dawn via these shadow-voices) is clearly rooted in a long history with the static, not a late bolt-on. The internal conflict between self-erasure and ascension into a darker prophet-self is legible and paid off in her final decision to both broadcast and step through. A minor limitation is that most of this conflict is articulated in thematic language rather than dramatized through small, concrete frictions or hesitations in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Posy’s motivation—to translate between generations before echoes vanish—is clear, particular, and coherently embodied in her ritual with the jars and the music box. Her emotional life is mostly shown through perception and action rather than labels, and choices like spending pennies on the box instead of bread feel grounded. What’s missing, slightly, is a sharper sense of internal contradiction under pressure; her faith in the method is tested conceptually but not dramatically strained. The late arrival of the child mostly confirms rather than complicates her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mireya’s competence, history with the ice, and “logically emotional calculus” are all well-motivated and expressed through action rather than exposition, and her micro-choices (listening first, then altering the bowing, then forging a third option) feel rooted in character. The emotional register is embodied via sound, temperature, and physical risk rather than labels. However, her inner conflict remains relatively clean; we see the ethical dilemma clearly but less of any deep flaw or self-sabotaging impulse that would complicate it. The final tears work, but the personal cost feels more like noble burden than a truly character-redefining wound.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s contradiction—impatience as a “second heart” versus his vowed role to “sculpt patience from impatience”—is specific, embodied, and governs every choice. His interiority stays grounded in sensory focus (cold stone, hum of rails, after-images) rather than abstract label-speak. The arc from rattling restlessness to carrying impatience as “a smooth, dark stone” reads as an earned renunciation with cost: he subordinates egoic urgency to a near-invisible, timing-based role. The only minor limitation is that no relational crucible appears on the page; the pressure is entirely solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara is sharply drawn: the “preventable death investigator” frame, her calm gait, and the father backstory give her a distinct psychology and history. Her motivations—professional duty, personal recognition of control and complicity—are coherent and feed directly into her choices. The basement flashback and her reaction to Park’s journal embody contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. personal trauma) without over-explaining them. A slight tendency to state motives (“This was why she had taken the case”) instead of always dramatizing them keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Emil’s motivation and moral conflict are clear and specific—his guilt, sense of duty, and affection for Rowan all drive distinct choices (seeking Olya, paying with candle funds, sending the list). His internal contradiction (obedience to the death warrant vs. need to act on his doubts) is present, though mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized on the page. Olya’s role as a pragmatic yet hesitant counterpoint works well, with her reluctance and eventual complicity readable in small gestures. The final stance—walking toward the execution “beside truth”—feels earned and carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Juniper’s motivation—curiosity harnessed to the Algorithm’s yearning—is clear and specific, and her irreverent awe comes through in embodied ways (“her awe wore a smirk,” the “irreverent bark” of laughter). However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched; she never seriously wavers or faces a sharp values trade-off. The realization that the bell wants a translator, not a clapper, is conceptually strong but not paired with a deeply contested inner struggle. The cost of her choice (risk, isolation in hearing what others can’t) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The keeper’s motivation—compelled by anomalous data, forbidden logs, and her mother’s erasure—builds cleanly to the sacrifice of her own identity. Interiority is present but mostly in summary; we rarely feel contradictory impulses in the moment of choice (her final decision comes almost too smoothly for such a life-voiding cost). Still, the link between her job, her mother, and her refusal to collude with corporate forgetting is vivid and character-specific. The closing transformation into a “blank user” and living archive is earned by prior traits and history.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives are clear and rooted in a compelling contradiction—trained detachment vs innate/emergent empathy—and her decision to swallow her bottled emotions is a strong, earned pivot. Interiority is concrete and particular (“every kindness she had denied herself”), and her final stance shift (border as bridge, heart unhidden) feels motivated by the harbor sequence. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened with a bit more in-the-moment hesitation or fear at key beats (swallowing empathy, confronting the Keeper). The Keeper himself is thematically strong but remains more emblem than character, which slightly flattens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—shifting from euthanasia tourist to someone compelled to “learn the sound of approaching endings”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices through the years. Her interiority is rendered via concrete, character-particular perceptions (sound, ice, objects) rather than generic emotion labels, and the boy’s presence meaningfully tests and redirects her stance. The final renunciation—she gives away the heirloom and accepts a life of staying to listen—is earned and carries a quiet but real cost. The only restraint on a higher score is that moments of internal contradiction (e.g., impulse to spectate vs. to serve) are more implied than directly dramatized in sharp, in-scene conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marco’s inner life is specific, embodied, and consistent, with clear motivation rooted in loss, duty, and latent hope; the choice to regraft and write a new note feels earned from his reflections on vines and destiny. Contradictory impulses—resignation versus renewed risk—are legible in how he treats the letter and the vineyard. The main limitation is that his emotional shift happens smoothly, with little real resistance or self-sabotage on the page, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The walker’s motivation—to preserve wisdom’s echo and atone for a prior failure signified by his scar—is clear and consistent, and his ritual choices are legible. Interiority is handled through perception and ritual rather than explicit emotion, which suits the tone but keeps his contradictions (duty vs. fear of failure, detachment vs. yearning) more implied than dramatized. The scar/backstory line nicely grounds his stake, but the moment passes quickly without much embodied emotional fallout. Overall he reads as particular and purposeful, but still somewhat archetypal rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s motivation and worldview are vivid and particular, and her small ritual choices (arranging the spiral, using the key, waiting for witnesses) feel consistent and rooted in character. However, she faces little real resistance, and we don’t see much genuine internal contradiction or cost beyond a generalized ache. The emotional experience stays in one register of serene melancholy rather than degrading under stress. The closing acceptance—“masterpiece complete when shared”—lands, but it doesn’t foreclose a meaningful alternative path for her.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization as a reticent, margin-dwelling scholar is specific and consistent, and her shift from cataloguer to witness feels earned. Her motives (to decode the pattern, then to testify and leave the crystal) are clear and aligned with her temperament. Internal conflict is understated—there’s little simultaneous push–pull beyond a faint regret—which keeps this shy of the very top tier. Still, her values and choices are legible and quietly consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet’s motivation—to find “the sound of growing older” under the constraint of his backwards-erasing memory—is specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (chalk marks, driftwood spirals, playing the tape) flow clearly from it. His interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic rather than generic. However, his emotional range is fairly narrow (meditative melancholy and longing) and we get limited active internal contradiction or genuinely pressured decisions, which slightly flattens his complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is sharply etched as a solitary, hyper-competent repairer whose long stasis makes the choice to leave feel costly and earned. Her motives—to “harness the ephemeral” and to respond to the shaking foundations—are consistently rooted in her history and craft. Internal conflict (attachment vs. release) is present but largely articulated via aphoristic lines rather than dramatized frictions in the moment, which keeps this just short of extraordinary. The mentor memory nicely retrofits her final decision but could carry a touch more lived ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is sharply etched through her work habits, sensory associations, and the “decisively kind” stance that governs her choices, and Calderon’s small gestures (tracing the vinyl like braille) give him texture despite limited page time. Her motivation—to offer a “flawless goodbye”—is clear and drives her use of the shard and the kalimba. What’s missing for the very top band is a stronger on-page contradiction or ambivalence in Mara under peak pressure; she carries weight, but rarely feels internally at war. The emotional cost of her role is implied more than dramatized, especially before the final realization on the skybridge.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motivation (to relearn what was unlearned and to find where shadows go) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her final trade—keeping others’ shadows by giving up her own wandering one—is legible and earned. However, her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized: she moves from curiosity to high-stakes sacrifice with impressive competence but little on-page hesitation or contradiction. We see more of her role (rune scholar, methodical operator of the orrery) than of her unique emotional texture under pressure. A bit more friction between her desire for knowledge and the personal cost would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s inner fracture between “forgiving skeptic” and shaken believer is specific, embodied, and consistently motivated from the alder-root misidentification to her walk down the bone-paver path. Her guilt over the wrong verdict tangibly drives her micro-choices—following the briar, taking the map, placing the tooth. The changeling-as-story functions as a sharp relational mirror that pressures her stance without collapsing into allegorical flatness. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting a life guided by bright fractures rather than certainty) feels earned and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s motivation—to create sharable, non-burning light rooted in loneliness and inherited wisdom—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from entering the grotto to sacrificing the pearl. Interiority is textured and embodied (“weight settle inside her chest, the exact mass of every night she had spent alone”), avoiding generic emotional labels. The change at the end—her shift from hungry watcher to steady source of calm—feels earned by the ritual, memories, and cost of losing the pearl. Internal contradiction (yearning for the heavens vs. accepting an earthbound, quiet role) is present, though it could be pushed slightly harder under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—to reclaim and replant her trauma—is specific, embodied, and consistently drives her actions, and Elias’s presence sharpens that without stealing focus. Her contradictory impulses (visibility vs secrecy, voice vs hush) are dramatized in choices like recording, then burying, the second confession. Emotional textures feel lived rather than diagnostic. If anything, Elias remains more symbolic than fully pressured as an individual, but that suits the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation and inner conflict are clear, specific, and active: fear of failure, guilt toward her characters, and practical pressure (editor, landlord) all braid into her choice to seek the nexus. Her emotional life is embodied (“mist tasted of salt and wet paper,” “sentences rearranging themselves beneath her sternum”) rather than labeled. The confrontation with Lira (“You left me mid-knock”) crystallizes her flaw and drives a credible, costly change. The final decision to be rewritten rather than to hoard these hopes feels earned by prior micro-choices with the boy and the pianist.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—curing her daughter and restoring ancestral practices—is vivid and consistent, and her competence under pressure tracks well with the ritual’s demands. However, internal conflict is largely implied rather than dramatized; we’re told the cultural grief and stakes but rarely see her hesitating, doubting, or misstepping in the moment. The emotions are mostly carried by atmosphere and backstory instead of contradictory impulses on the page. The final act of releasing the pollen feels earned but not especially costly for her as an individual beyond generalized burden.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s central motive—translating heartbeats into maps to find his lover—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his micro-choices (walking as if air were glass, refusing to use fire, choosing to stay). His grief and devotion are embodied rather than labeled, with strong physicalizations like the copper’s chill settling “where her name once lived.” There is some internal contradiction (his urge to move toward her vs. the chosen stillness of remaining) but the conflict stays mostly at the level of lyric statement rather than sharply dramatized impulse-clash in the moment. Still, the final endurance/renunciation—accepting that he will never leave—is well-earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ansel’s motivation—to understand and then neutralize the theft of time while preserving “wonder”—is specific, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (feeding the device silence, sealing it, locking the cellar). His interiority is rich and character-particular, filtered through craft (locks, mechanisms) and memory. Internal conflict (reason vs wonder, repair vs preservation) is present but remains more tonal than sharply dramatized. The ending choice to lock away the key credibly forecloses a path with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The weaver’s motivation—maintaining the lattice and, more secretly, evading her own unresolved guilt—is clear and coherently drives each ritual step. Her final confession about leaving her sister feels earned by the accumulating pressure of the grotto and the faltering flame. Interiority is specific and embodied through the ritual actions rather than abstract self-analysis. The only limitation is that her individuality beyond the role (e.g., specific, idiosyncratic traits) remains more archetypal than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s grief, craft, and circus past interlock into a highly specific psychology; her impulse to “contain” Emil’s last performance through carving is both credible and particular. Micro-choices—the jars she labels, the commands she whispers, hanging the latch—reveal a hierarchy of values (control vs. permission, memory vs. erasure) with felt cost. Internal contradiction (opening cages vs. wanting him to “stay if she just kept the cage door closed”) is present, though her arc leans more toward deepened endurance than a sharp turn. The final acceptance that memory is “both cage and key” feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific, with contradictions between the older self’s weariness and the ghost’s “chronological contempt” landing cleanly. Motivation—to negotiate with his younger self about squandered or eroded futures—is clear and consistently expressed through concrete choices (mounting the mare, using/breaking the wheel, reading fragments). Emotional texture is embodied via surreal but felt images (voices as sand abrading the lens, cold in the ribs when the ghost’s hand passes through). The final endurance—stepping back on the carousel alone while the ghost stays—reads as an earned, costly acceptance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alya’s motives and temperament are sharply etched: a pragmatic, quietly idealistic engineer trying to “resurrect hope” via systems rather than sentiment. Her choices (entering, tracing flows, rerouting glycol, rewriting the board, then leaving with intent to return) all arise credibly from that core. Interiority is embedded in perception and metaphor rather than explicit self-analysis, which works well. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or moral friction in her—she moves from resolve to fulfillment with little internal push–pull.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Arlen’s motivation—to relinquish a lifelong, failed dream—is clear, consistent, and seeded from the first paragraph, with his choices (bringing the prototype, laying it down, walking away) tracking cleanly to that desire. His interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (mainsprings, observatory, investors), and the final renunciation feels earned. However, his emotional palette skews toward a single, sustained melancholy/quiet awe, with limited on-page contradiction or messiness under pressure. This slightly flattens the sense of internal conflict despite the credible final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is precise and consistent—unraveling her father’s constructed heroism—and her micro-choices (sneaking aboard, insisting on the coordinate, deciding to disseminate the truth) all grow plausibly from that drive. Interiority is vivid and embodied through objects like the sundial and the logs, with a convincing mix of reverence and anger. The internal change from needing a personal answer to accepting a larger, ongoing task lands cleanly and with cost. Captain Riga is sketched economically but credibly as a hard-edged facilitator whose assent underlines Mara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ari’s motives and habits feel fully inhabited—forty winters of gathering, her rope literacy, and the seed envelopes in her pockets all cohere into a specific person under a clear value system. Her patience and quiet defiance in the confrontation with the harbormaster are well-motivated, though her internal conflict is more implied than dramatically torn. The harbormaster is thinly sketched but functions as an efficient vector of pressure rather than a character in his own right. The final act of planting on the dock reads as an earned, character-true crystallization rather than a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The traveler’s motivation and emotional throughline are clear and specific—her obsession with “explained absences” and the way the thread houses her clients’ presences both feel earned. Her final realization that she’s been her own first client lands as a credible outgrowth of the prior beats rather than a bolt-on twist. Internal conflict (compulsion to explain vs. the cost of living outside ordinary life) is present, though it could be sharpened with a few more moments of real resistance or doubt in-scene. Relationships are off-page, but their imprint on her is convincingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prince’s core motivation—to reawaken beauty in a rusted mechanical world—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Interiority is vivid and particular (“hypothesizing about everything,” guilt over the raven feather), though it stays more archetypal than psychologically intricate. Internal conflict (reviving beauty vs the cost of destabilizing his world) only crystallizes late, at the fall. The final acceptance (“flawed genesis is still genesis”) feels earned but a bit more thematic than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s psychology is rich, specific, and embodied: the firefighter daughter of an arsonist planting his “residue” reads as both contradiction and inevitability. Her micro-choices under pressure (continuing the ritual despite flinching at the gull/courtroom echo, tying the coin, promising saplings next year) all emerge cleanly from that core tension. Emotions are shown through physical memory (scarred forearm, “tapped twice, a private Morse”) rather than labels. The only slight limit is how articulate she is about her own motives (“trying to prove that scars can sing rather than simply scream”), which edges toward stated thesis rather than dramatized confusion in a couple of lines.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—“realistically imaginative,” testing the impossible in her hands, and driven by liberation rather than grief. The progression from skeptic to daughter who speaks to the box tracks cleanly and feels earned. Internal contradiction (skeptical yet drawn to magic; determined to free memories yet complicit in one) is present but could deepen via more on-page resistance at key beats. The emotional cost of confronting her own broken promise at the Fountain of Unkept Promises is the strongest character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and contradiction—yearning to “share light without using fire” while feeling strangled by the root/exile destiny—are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in the gear-crack future and his grandmother’s line turning from comfort to constriction. Interiority is vivid and character-specific, keyed to objects (gear, petals, beacon) rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is that his internal struggle remains mostly lyric and reflective; we don’t see many concrete, resisted micro-choices before he commits to the beacon, so the ultimate choice feels strongly grounded but not sharply contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carver is specific and textured—a meditative artisan whose vocation plausibly shapes how she engages with grief and the uncanny. Her motivation (to understand the village’s grief) is clear and continuous, and her ultimate reorientation of her craft feels earned. However, internal conflict remains relatively abstract; she moves from seeking to understanding with little on-page struggle or contradiction beyond summarized “weight.” The climactic acceptance inside the chrysalis leans toward declarative realization rather than dramatized, messy ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent: his duty, resentment, and love for his brother are all legible and in tension. The core choice—halt the clock and free the village or keep it running and feed the sea—is clearly motivated by that ethical diligence and familial debt. His decision to both complete “forgive” and keep the clock alive via the rake-handle bob feels earned and costly. If anything, his competence and clarity under pressure slightly smooth over what could be messier emotional fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mercy’s motivations are clear and consistent, from her “tenderly organized” work habits through her compulsion to decode the tapestry and descend. Her emotional life is mostly conveyed through perception and action rather than explicit labeling, which keeps her from feeling generic. The arc from blithe gardener to “keeper of the spiral” is earned by the sequence of discoveries and choices. What’s missing, keeping this just short of elite, is a more dramatized, in-scene conflict or hesitation as she realizes the cost of leaving the surface world.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cartographer’s motive—to seed innovation within constraint and to “prevail not by conquering the blank page but by surrendering to it”—is clear and consistently enacted through her climb, her self-erasure, and final step. Her internal life is specific and embodied via the cost of memories and bodily warmth, though contradictory impulses (doubt vs conviction, fear vs drive) are only lightly sketched rather than fully dramatized. The sacrifice at the end feels earned and forecloses a personal path with real cost. A slightly more present sense of reluctance or competing desire in the middle stretch would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mila’s motive—preserving outlawed stories through notation and dust—is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (rosin ink, antennae, staying to keep copying under raid) track cleanly from that drive. Interiority is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure, which flattens her a bit into emblem rather than fully messy person. The inspectors function as atmospheric forces rather than individuated pressures, which suits the mode but limits relational complexity. The endurance at the end (she does not flee; she keeps copying) reads as an earned stasis with conceptual cost, but the emotional cost on her personally is under-detailed.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s grief, artistic compulsion, and need to make sense of her grandmother’s half-told stories are specific and embodied (charcoal on hands, the chair carried “like a funeral procession of one”). Her self-deceptions (“telling herself it was just furniture”) give her an internal contradiction that feels lived-in, not schematic. Micro-choices—precise placement of the chair, when to don the mask, how to scatter the powder—arise credibly from those motives. The final endurance stance (accepting absence and incomplete truth as the only available material) is emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Caldera’s worldview, habits (sewer-diving, vaccine refusal), and obsession with truthful “clocks” give her a sharply individual psychology, and her final choice to speak publicly reads as a credible extension of that. Her interiority is concrete and filtered through her fixation on sediment, rot, and time, so emotions feel embodied rather than labeled. The internal conflict—wanting purity of truth yet participating in a city built on lies—could be surfaced a touch more in moments of hesitation before she engraves and then addresses the crowd. Still, the closing sense of an earned new “stratum” inside her provides a satisfying, motivated shift.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and particular—she wants to repair a city’s psychic fabric through a lost musical craft—and her actions track cleanly from that drive. Her emotional life is embodied and specific (listening for “frequencies anger forgets,” offering her own voice as sacrifice), with a credible mix of grief, rage, and disciplined attention. The final endurance—choosing silence as root tone rather than reclaiming her former public voice—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. A slight limitation is that her internal contradictions are more implied than directly dramatized in on-page waverings or missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s motivation (rebellious chef weaponizing memory and flavor) is vivid and consistent, and her choices clearly arise from that core—stealing the seed, timing the planting, feeding it blood. Interiority is concrete and sensorial rather than abstract. The main limitation is that we glimpse little genuine doubt or contradictory impulse; she reads as assured more than internally conflicted, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. Her change is more in the world than in herself, so the personal cost is felt but not deeply explored.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and particular—her belief that “routine…was a fragile varnish over wonder” and her history on the dusk shift anchor her motives. The involuntary-truth constraint plus her attachment to wonder credibly drive her forbidden ascent and the climactic decision to lie. Internal contradiction (truth-bound but willing to break that core trait) is strong but could be a touch more embodied in the moment of the lie. The boy is effectively sketched as pressure rather than a full character, which suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s sensibility and vocation (“keeper of the almost-unseen”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—pressing the shard to the window, following the streetlights’ Morse, arranging displaced objects—arise naturally from that core. The piece is more lyric than psychological, so internal contradiction is muted; we don’t see competing impulses so much as an unconflicted acceptance of her role. Her “mission refined” at the end constitutes a credible, if quiet, evolution rather than a sharp turn. The cost of that refinement—taking on an ongoing, solitary duty—is implied more than dramatized, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The statue narrator’s interiority is rich and specific, with clear conflicting impulses: loyalty to the condemned court vs. attraction to the gardener’s nuance and change. The decision to shatter the ampoule is well-motivated and feels like a meaningful self-betrayal/renewal. Emotional texture is embedded in perception (barnacles’ grief, rusted gates’ panic) rather than labels. The only minor limitation is that the gardener remains more emblematic than fully embodied, though it suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to locate the “texture” of a missed opportunity—threads clearly through the piece and culminates in her refusal to step through the ripple, which reads as an Earned Stasis choice with cost. Her interiority is specific (math/probability/regret as recursive function) and coherent, though emotion is sometimes carried more by concept than by embodied sensation. The panic when the staircase slows and the grim choice to keep climbing rather than accept rescue show credible contradiction. A slightly greater grounding in physical feeling (beyond metaphor) at peak beats could deepen her humanity even further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motives (insomnia-driven need to finish the uncommissioned mural, belief in lost languages, hunger to make something that matters) are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. Her emotional life is embodied in specific, idiosyncratic perceptions rather than labels (“insomnia now a lantern,” fatigue “a blanket rather than a blade”). Internal contradiction is present but quiet—she’s both exhausted and almost exultant—so the crucible never quite bites down. The relationship with Jules is delicately handled but more atmospheric than pressurizing, so relational stakes don’t fully transform by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurelia’s motives and arc are clear and specific—her shift from detached curator to participant is well-earned through concrete beats (e.g., photographing “not for display but for distribution,” finally shaping “H” for home). The Chen women, especially the grandmother and Mei, apply meaningful interpersonal pressure that exposes Aurelia’s blind spot (“you think we’re the ones being rescued…”). Emotional life is embodied in objects and actions more than in abstract labels, which works well. The only limit is that Aurelia’s internal contradictions under pressure could be made sharper on the page rather than mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The maker’s fear of prophesied death versus his compulsion to tinker his way out of it creates a coherent, motivated interior that carries through the whole piece. His choices under pressure (tying the hunger stone on, then cutting the string and accepting the loss of his gift) feel well-earned and specific. Internal conflict is present but sketched rather than deeply dwelt in, so he reads slightly more as a mythic figure than a fully individuated psyche, which trims the top end of the score.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—the advisor, the flat-line, the tactile fixation on the clasp—and the desire to “trick fear into revealing its weakness” feels rooted in recent trauma. The contradiction between wanting mastery over fear and needing to expose vulnerability plays out credibly in her hesitation to “unbosom the memory” and her eventual choice to walk the mirror corridor. The final act of pressing the clasp into the gray child’s palm registers as an earned internal shift rather than a flip epiphany. The only constraint at this length is that relationships are mostly with facets of self, so status dynamics never get fully stress-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet’s motivation is clear and specific—he wants to convert obstacle into rhythm and literally move the raft with sound—so his actions read as coherent and purposeful. However, interiority is minimal; we infer his beliefs from behavior and aphoristic narration, not from embodied, conflicted feeling, so he remains more figure than person. There is almost no friction between competing values (aesthetics vs. safety, faith vs. doubt) that would sharpen his key choices. The children and crew function as a faceless chorus rather than individuated pressures, keeping the emotional crucible relatively cool.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartographer’s motivation (mapping the watchers, finding what happened to her mother) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. “Quietly driven” is shown in behavior—she keeps playing even as merchants scream—rather than just told. Internal conflict (duty to the city vs urge to reach the horizon/mother) is present but could be sharpened with one more concrete moment of hesitation or competing impulse. The final earned shift—accepting she cannot follow now but will chart a path for others—lands with credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is sharply etched: a rigorous, “emotionally rational” historian torn between inherited patriotism and her commitment to truth, and that contradiction is dramatized in the pull she feels toward Rowan’s beautiful lie. Her motives are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure (handling the letter, deciding to evade the watchman, accepting future backlash) all flow from that core. The seduction of the myth vs. her ethical drive is present on the page rather than told abstractly. The only minor limitation is that we never see a relationship on the page to further stress-test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply etched through action and perception: the inkwell ritual, fingertip diagnostics, and her wince at the gull ground “stoically sensitive” in behavior. Her motive shift from certifying what will stand to cataloging abandoned dreams is clear and specific. Internal contradiction (professional detachment vs. raw confession) is present but could be stressed more under direct pressure. The final endurance/renunciation—walking away lighter but not redeemed—is believable and earned, if emotionally quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to uncover the catalogue’s erased origins—remains clear and consistent, and her choices (coming during the blackout, extinguishing the lantern, deciding to rewrite the index) flow credibly from that drive. Her interiority is specific and textured (“the more she felt the catalogue indexing her instead”), giving her a distinct cast of mind. The decisive change at the end—choosing to remember rather than collude in erasure—feels earned by what precedes it. What’s slightly missing for top-tier is a sharper on-page clash between fear/self-preservation and her ethical drive; her resolve comes almost too smoothly once the revelation hits.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lantern maker’s motivation—to metabolize her daughter’s last breath into something bearable—is clear, specific, and propels every choice, from buying the dream ribbon to stealing the tea leaf. Interiority is embodied through craft metaphors (“grief is only another kind of flame”) rather than abstract labels, and her contradictions (hoarding fragments vs. releasing them as cranes) feel lived-in. The final state—hands smelling of tea instead of kerosene—reads as an earned stasis rather than neat cure. A slight limitation is that we glimpse only this single mode of her being; there’s little sense of her flaws beyond grief and craft-competence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, guilt, and compulsion to “harvest” unused potential create a rich, specific interiority, and his final decision to jump is well-motivated by the prior accumulation of self-disgust and systemic thinking. Contradictory impulses—love for his bride vs. willingness to become “death’s accountant”—are present in scene, not just summarized. The only slight limitation is that we never see a concrete, human-scale alternative he might plausibly choose now, so his arc is powerful but a bit locked into one grim channel.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—find the truth about her vanished parents and “where [she] belong[s]”—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in agreeing to pull the lever and accept what the print reveals. However, her inner conflict is relatively underplayed: there’s little sense of competing impulses (fear vs desire, doubt vs hope) in the moment of decision. The pilgrim is memorable but thin: “perpetually surprised eyes” does more atmospheric work than pressure or complication. The final shift to acceptance and readiness to follow the map feels earned, but it’s a smooth slide rather than a contested, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the black-market genealogist whose skill at forgery and need to soothe others’ pain has curdled into profound guilt. His interior conflict between continuing to lie and confessing to his dying mother is specific and embodied (the watch hand cutting his palm, the driftwood carvings as tactile guilt). The mother is sketched more lightly but still distinct, and her final line reframes their relationship credibly. The final choice—to move toward confession even as he discovers she already knows—feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—regret over his brother and a vocation built on “recycling mistakes into wisdom”—is specific, consistent, and drives his micro-choices (gloves, eliciting fears, rope ritual). Interiority is implied more through symbolic actions than explicit thought, but the contradiction between his burdened regret and forward-looking “trafficker in futures” stance reads clearly in scene. Seris and the guards are sketched with efficient, telling strokes (her question about contrition vs kingdom’s debt; their opposed emblems and shared shame). The final endurance—relinquishing the pull and accepting heavier, intangible “recycled mistakes”—feels earned and costs him something real.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vivid and specific: a once-competent navigator whose need to “align heart and action” clashes with her addiction to charts and certainty. Her interiority is sensorial, embodied, and non-generic, with concrete micro-choices (following the irregular pole light despite the chart, tearing charts into confetti). The arc from self-described “broken navigator” to someone who accepts navigating by improvised signs with cost is legible and earned. Slightly aphoristic lines brush against abstraction, but they remain grounded enough in her particular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The seeker’s motivation—to recover the capacity for empathy even at personal cost—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices, culminating in stepping into the lake and then returning to write letters. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“Memory returned not as narrative but as nausea…”), with moral contradiction (former callousness vs. present yearning) carried through. His final stance—accepting responsibility rather than erasing it—is earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of engineered hollowness. The only small limitation is that relationships with those he harmed are kept mostly in image and silhouette, so relational pressure is powerful but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s desire to reclaim her sister is specific, embodied, and consistent, and her choices under pressure (resisting her own metamorphosis, then choosing fusion) feel earned. Internal contradiction—wanting to stay flesh to save her versus being pulled into the same transformation—is dramatized rather than stated. The sibling bond is vivid in tiny particulars (nicknames, shared meals, the burial of their mother) that ground the myth. If anything, her role as “beast whisperer” exerts less concrete pressure on her decisions than the sister dynamic does.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s motivation—to locate and reclaim “lost time” around her dead child—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from the ascent to the final tea ritual. Her interiority is rendered through highly particular sensory associations (iron and lullabies, sugared milk gone cold) rather than abstract labels. Contradictory impulses—penitence vs. tenderness, the desire to undo vs. the willingness to be “perplexed”—coexist on the page rather than in neat stages. The choice to speak the name aloud and leave the saucer behind feels earned and visibly costly without resolving her into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sister Halcyon’s motives and interiority are vivid, specific, and consistent: a pacifist determined to transmute collective grief into a nonviolent act of cosmic repair. Her micro-choices (collecting photos, answering the hologram mothers, choosing to stay) align cleanly with that ethos. The fusion of her joy and sorrow at the climax feels earned rather than epiphanic hand-waving. Internal contradiction (the cost of leaving everything vs. her commitment to mercy) is present but could be sharpened with one more moment of felt hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s internal arc from ruined benefactor to someone who reconceives “currency” as touch and transformation is clear and earned through on-page choices (releasing the bugs, taking Lira’s hand, entering the cave). His philanthropy and destitution meaningfully shape his responses rather than sitting as labels. Lira, however, functions more as a catalytic emblem than as a fully realized person, and their relational dynamic doesn’t quite reach crucible level. Emotional contradiction (fear vs. hope, shame vs. purpose) is present but could be more sharply embodied rather than carried by imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Garnet’s motive—to betray her orders and ignite revolution—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, from reading the sundial to manipulating Voss. Interiority is mostly implied via images like “cradle of sparks” rather than laid out, but it still feels character-particular, not generic. Internal conflict (fear vs resolve, loyalty vs revolt) is present but lightly sketched; she rarely hesitates, which slightly flattens her arc. The final unmasking is earned and legible as a change, though the personal cost could be shaded more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive (the promise to Mira / need to understand patterns) is clear and consistent, and the precognitive curse gives him a strong, specific internal bind. His actions—placing the rocks, touching the eel—track cleanly with that motivation and reveal a hierarchy of values (witnessing over control). Emotional life is more conceptual than bodily, but still character-particular rather than generic. The final realization about promises and understanding feels earned by prior beats, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive—to preserve forbidden language by transmuting it into starlight—is specific, consistent, and drives every action from the funicular ascent to the chemical dissolution. Interiority is concrete and embodied (the mask as “a stone,” the scars as “cartography”), so she reads as a particular person rather than an idea. The main limitation is the relative absence of on-page contradictory impulses; fear, doubt, or attachment to the human world are implied but never truly contest her resolve. The final “departure” feels earned but carries a slightly abstracted emotional cost rather than a fully dramatized rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian is sharply etched—a dueling philosopher whose mechanical arm and maternal mantra clearly root his motivation—while Vale is intriguing but somewhat under-internalized. Their shared history (treatise on time ethics, split over peace vs provocation) gives the rivalry weight. However, Elian’s internal conflict (ego vs curiosity, rivalry vs collaboration) stays mostly implied rather than actively dramatized under pressure. The closing shift to collaboration is believable but could carry more felt cost if his ambivalence surfaced more explicitly in the duel itself.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lark’s interiority and contradiction (cynical vagrant who ritualistically sheds that cynicism) feel vivid and specific, and his choices—sharing the tin, stepping up to talk Rourke down, claiming “co-conspirator of light”—are all credibly motivated. Marin’s mixture of guard-role and quiet subversion is strong, though she reads slightly idealized, with fewer on-page flaws or blind spots. Their relationship clearly functions as a crucible: status shifts as she moves from authority figure to accomplice, and both adjust behavior under that pressure. The personality change at the end is earned by earlier molting imagery and carries a felt cost in abandoning the “wanderer” self.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pianist’s longing, stubborn faith in the clock, and eventual refusal of the “safe loop” read as coherent, well-motivated, and particular to her identity as a musician. Her internal conflict—between waiting in an aestheticized elsewhere and risking the real night—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (carrying the clock, trading its chime, then reclaiming it and leaving). Emotional states are mostly embodied via objects and setting rather than direct labels, which suits the lyric mode. There’s a slight distance from her body and lived history that keeps this just shy of maximal psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Calyx’s motivation and internal conflict are sharply articulated—duty to the Aya versus loyalty to her own originating memory—and her final trade reads as both inevitable and costly. Her profession (“reality checker”) meaningfully colors her perceptions and choices rather than sitting as a label. Secondary figures (Elder Numa, the Aya children) are sketched but functional, mostly as pressure and witness rather than deep foils. The only slight limitation is that we glimpse very little of Calyx’s life beyond this vocation, so her loss, while conceptually clear, lands a bit more intellectually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s regret toward the mother and complicated, reverent dependence on Kaede are specific, embodied, and consistent, and their need “to diffuse the ache” cleanly motivates the scene. Kaede’s history (the severance, his lost voice) is deftly suggested and enriches his role as ritual guide. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized—there’s little on-page wavering or resistance once the ritual begins. Still, the final reconfiguration (carrying the lesson into teaching, understanding pruning as apology) feels earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is distinct and tightly controlled; Mara’s interiority consistently filters the world through her scientific expertise ("preprocess reality," "molecular accretion"). The emotional arc from rigid intellectualization to acceptance is earned through the scene's action. Her contradictory impulses—using cosmic tools to measure microscopic decay to avoid dealing with human grief—create genuine depth.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich but abstract, relying on metaphor ("breath on cracked glass") rather than embodied emotion. While the shift in motivation is stated ("discover purpose in the pauses"), the psychological pivot feels asserted by the narrator rather than earned through the character's struggle on the page. The prompt-mandated attribute "steady adaptive" is applied as a label to heart, smile, and trail, flattening the characterization into a repeated keyword.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s internal drive to translate rhythm is compelling and anchors the narrative effectively. Her competence is established early, and the choice to leave the case behind signals a clear shift in her relationship to the past. However, her emotional progression feels slightly linear; the transition from grief to mastery lacks a moment of crippling doubt or deeper internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist serves as a functional vessel for the mythic narrative, but the specific trait "inadvertently stubborn" is stated rather than dramatized in the present action; he complies with the dream summons immediately, contradicting the label. His acceptance of the "tenure" at the end is poignant but lacks prior internal friction, making the transformation feel destined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a competent, noble protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction; her decisions (e.g., tripling runs) are immediate and morally uncomplicated, missing the hesitation or specific dread that characterizes high-stakes leadership. The interaction with the boy establishes role well, but the emotional beats feel slightly archetypal rather than idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist and the stranger operate as thematic vessels rather than distinct individuals; the stranger’s dialogue ("I lost the address of the love I never gave") is stylized to match the narrator’s voice perfectly, destroying verisimilitude. The immediate, friction-free cooperation between them lacks the hesitation or negotiation that characterizes genuine human interaction. Motivation is stated ("must find where unused love is stored") rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle between preservation and experience is dramatized effectively through the physical journey. Her contradictory impulses—to map time yet be trapped by it—resolve in a meaningful choice to engage with the cycle of loss rather than transcend it. The final beat earns the character's emotional shift, though the moment of realization relies slightly on stated epiphany ("she understood then") rather than purely subtextual action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is highly competent and motivated, but functions more as a mythic archetype than a flawed individual. There is little internal conflict or doubt; her success feels preordained by her "patient strategic" nature, lacking the visceral cost or hesitation that deepens characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose professional expertise (hearing aids) integrates seamlessly with her emotional deficit (grief). The pivot from external blame to internal complicity ("she had chosen doubt over belief") provides a sophisticated deepening of character that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a fully realized character; her motivation ("curiosity") is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. Her competence is undermined by the resolution, which relies on the lucky coincidence of possessing the specific face needed rather than a "savvy" tactical choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s internal state is well-drawn, and the performative narration adds a distinct behavioral layer to her grief. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly unearned by on-page struggle; the "tectonic shift" happens somewhat smoothly through the ritual rather than through a difficult, cost-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Leo’s internal conflict between the stuntman’s bravado and his private phobia is compellingly drawn, anchoring the narrative in a strong, distinct perspective. The transition from fear to action feels earned through the encounter with the girl, though the final psychological pivot relies heavily on a sudden thematic realization rather than gradual emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetype, but the specific trait "mildly obsessed" is applied as a label (twice) rather than dramatized through complex behavior. The "mild" modifier clashes tonally with the apocalyptic stakes, making the obsession read more like a prompt insertion than organic character psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the emotional arc feels abstract and cerebral rather than embodied. The "cold burning sensation" serves as a label for emotion rather than a demonstrated reaction, and the character remains largely a vessel for the philosophical concept rather than a distinct personality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    The psychological logic of the coworkers creates a fatal plausibility break; maintaining a "prank" for three months while suspicion poisons the workplace reads as malice, not the benevolent test the story posits. Their motivation to plant a trail to the "stolen" item while fearing exposure is contradictory. Mira’s role is largely reactive, waiting for the plot to reveal itself to her rather than driving the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer with a distinct worldview, and her shift from deceiver to partner serves the arc well. However, the initial motivation (maintaining a "deception") feels slightly intellectualized rather than visceral, and the lack of internal resistance during the realization softens the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rich and coherent, grounding the sci-fi premises in a deeply felt sense of bodily regret and resignation. The shift from resentment to companionship with her prosthetic lungs is a distinct, earned emotional arc. The choice to remain the "obliging sky mechanic" feels motivated by the specific insight gained from the moth-bats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist is largely passive, guided by the ghost and a compliant environment rather than driving events through difficult choices. Motivation is summarized in exposition ("He'd always felt trapped") rather than dramatized through resistance or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oracle is a compelling, physically grounded vessel for the story's central metaphor; her internal struggle with the "seed" is visceral. While the "fault-tolerant" aspect remains largely a label rather than a driver of distinct tactical choices, her agency in externalizing the truth through the illustration is specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s internal conflict between skepticism and the sensory reality of the tunnel is compelling. Her shift from resistance to "secular forgiveness" is earned through physical interaction with the wheel, grounding the emotional arc in action rather than just thought.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is a well-defined archetype but lacks active interior conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene; her resignation to the library's erasure is absolute from the start, preventing any difficult micro-choices that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a functional archetype (the healer) who faces no internal contradiction or temptation; her struggle is external and quickly resolved by a prop. She lacks the specific, embodied friction of a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is a capable, perceptively realized archetype ("mystical archivist") whose internal landscape mirrors the setting well. While her "oddness" is stated, her internal conflict is subtle—the "hollow where longing had been" is resolved beautifully but not deeply dramatized as a struggle beforehand. She functions more as a poetic vessel for the ritual than a character forced into difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Chen is a distinct, motivated protagonist with a clear internal drive. However, the pivot from spy to "wind" relies on poetic abstraction rather than a grounded psychological turning point, and his key trait ("accidentally prophetic") is asserted via labels rather than fully dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is a compelling archetype defined by competence and a high-cost sacrifice. While interiority is limited to tactical necessity, his specific methodology (audio theology) provides sufficient character definition for this fable-like structure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist is a fitting vessel for this high-concept fable, with motivation clearly linked to the central conceit. However, her interiority feels somewhat procedural, serving as a delivery mechanism for the memories rather than a source of turbulent, contradictory human emotion; the "ache" is stated more than felt in the micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s internal struggle with the "labyrinth of self" is expertly dramatized through the external confrontation with the Elder Kael, satisfying the "relationships as crucible" test even with a self-duplicate. The backstory of the father anchors the high-concept premise in a recognizable emotional reality, providing necessary grounding for the surreal stakes. His choice to smash the tablet is a clearly motivated act of renunciation that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is well-rendered, with the sensory translation of deafness into vibration grounding her characterization. Her motivation—to trade numbness for pain—is compelling and clearly drives the narrative, though the transition feels slightly summarized rather than purely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic labels ("credibly curious nature," "motivation to nurture integrity") rather than dramatized desire. These insertions flatten the interiority at pivotal moments, violating the show-don't-tell standard and reducing the protagonist to a functional vessel for prompt terms.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s internal conflict between the analytical broker and the grieving husband is compelling and well-dramatized. The shift from selling light to brokering "invisible gardens" represents a distinct, earned character arc rooted in the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich and consistent, anchoring the "poet" persona effectively. However, the motivation ("texture of time") feels slightly abstract, and the emotional resonance relies heavily on the backstory of Marcus rather than a live, present-tense vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her path is linear and lacks internal opposition; she arrives with a plan and executes it without hesitation or doubt. The emotional transaction—trading the grandmother's bowl for the new music—reads more as a predetermined ritual than a pressurized choice with felt difficulty on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's internal shift is clear, and the choice to accept pain provides a solid arc. However, the peak emotional experience relies on diagnostic summary ("grief of a woman," "rage of a man") rather than embodied sensation, creating a layer of abstraction that distances the reader at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marisol’s characterization is exemplary; the fusion of her professional persona ("broker," "ledger") with her private morality ("compassion like cargo") creates a unique, consistent internal logic. Her motivations are enacted through specific behaviors—receipts, waivers—rather than abstract feelings, grounding the fable-like tone in tangible character work.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s internal conflict (doubt vs. desire) is established well ("lungs sewn shut"), and the shift to "seeker and signpost" is a distinct arc. The resolution leans on the magical vision triggered by the touch rather than a choice made in ambiguity, but the final commitment to go "deeper" earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is singular and poignant, driving the narrative with focus. Her interiority—specifically the artist's lens of examining time like a "moth's wing"—adds distinct texture to her grief. The choice to trade her future is dramatic, though the emotional weight of that specific sacrifice (losing her later years) is accepted somewhat briskly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a mechanism to activate the plot rather than a fully realized character. Emotion is intellectualized through mathematical metaphors ("equation," "variable") rather than embodied, creating distance. The trait "gently inventive" is told via label rather than demonstrated through improvisation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on the initial label "kindly methodical" rather than demonstrated traits under pressure. The protagonist’s transition from hiding to revealing himself lacks internal conflict or hesitation, making the emotional arc feel unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s internal conflict between scientific control and natural chaos is drawn with precision, making her surrender a credible, high-stakes resolution. The epiphany ("relationships required surrender") feels slightly abstract for the moment of crisis, but the physical embodiment of the change grounds it effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is declared via the repetitive "thresh meaning" phrase rather than emerging from choice; the final epiphany (insomnia as gift) feels unearned by on-page struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The characters serve the fable-like allegory effectively, with the clairvoyant’s resignation ("bright as obsidian") providing emotional weight. However, the pilgrim remains largely a vessel for the setting’s logic; his acceptance of the life-altering gift feels more inevitable than forged through sharp internal conflict or active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archivist is a functional archetype rather than a realized character, moving through a linear quest with minimal internal friction. Interactions lack emotional risk; the "visionary" attribute is asserted as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult choice or behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is clear, but the execution relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak during peak beats (e.g., "I left because I was afraid of color"). This reduces emotional containment into explicit thematic statements rather than embodied reaction. The transition from meticulous mapper to artist feels asserted via dialogue rather than earned through behavioral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is a clearly defined focalizer with a legible internal conflict (skepticism vs. grief/wonder). However, the pivotal transition—where she chooses to "listen instead of refute"—is bridged by the label "courageously kind" rather than a dramatized struggle or hesitation that earns the shift. The emotional progression is smooth but lacks the friction of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vey’s weariness and motivation are consistent, shifting credibly from boredom to decisive action. The transition from observer to participant is earned, though the "bored immortal" archetype feels slightly stock until the final choice charges it with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cassidy is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—honesty versus heritage—drives the plot. The specific cost paid (the memory of the lullaby) grounds the magical transaction in genuine character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    Aurelia serves as a compelling, cohesive archetype for the story's magical logic, though she lacks the messier contradictions of a fully realized human. Her motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal shift—from forger to truth-sower—feels more like a functional requirement of the fable than a hard-won emotional pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s transition from a passive collector of echoes to an active agent of memory is compelling, and her final renunciation of the death certificate serves as a powerful, earned cost. The "nameless identity" is not just a label but is dramatized through her interactions with the environment and her choice to remain outside the official record.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen is a clearly defined protagonist with a distinct worldview (skepticism) that is challenged and altered by the narrative arc. His motivation to decode the riddle is consistent, and the internal cost—admitting measurement is a mystery—is well-earned. The "gloomy cheerfulness" is stated early but effectively dramatized in the final laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina is a distinct focalizer whose internal conflict ("culture shock absorber" vs. resistance) drives the narrative. Her connection to the city is grounded in specific history (the grandfather's pier), and her final choice to release the stone chip effectively dramatizes her shift from preservation to evolution. The "dual allegiance" is stated rather than fully dramatized in scene, but her actions consistently align with her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is deep and inextricably linked to the story's action; the inspector's interiority ("wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning") anchors the high-concept premise in genuine emotion. The choice to use a chemical relic over digital tools is well-motivated by her specific reverence for the "days when time still felt abundant."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s competence is distinct and layered with specific sensory adaptations that define her agency. The connection between her past trauma and the drone’s "panic" grounds the technical solution in character history, earning the final success. Her internal state ("magnetic calm") translates effectively into physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren is a distinct, active protagonist whose childhood curiosity drives the narrative. The transition from dutiful cataloger to secret-keeper is earned through action, though the specific trait "dry-witted" relies more on authorial labeling than dramatized interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychological subject; his interiority is abstract and metaphorical ("hollow inside his chest") rather than embodied. The backstory of the drowning child, while poetic, feels disconnected from the specific task at hand, leaving his motivation to sacrifice himself for this specific town feeling generic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira is a distinct, active protagonist whose internal landscape (guilt, memory) tightly integrates with the plot. Her decision to sacrifice the vial is a character-specific choice that earns the resolution with visible cost. The emotional arc from isolation to connection is well-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cassian is a distinct, motivated protagonist with a clear internal conflict (truth vs. heritage). His internal state is vivid, though occasionally relies on abstract summaries ("motivation was not rescue") rather than embodied feeling. The resolution of his arc—accepting the "wolf" identity—is earned through the scene's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ghost functions more as a force of nature than a character making difficult choices; her shift from vengeance to forgiveness feels like a procedural completion of the magic rather than an emotional arc. The boy is largely passive, a prop in the ritual, and his sudden understanding of the orchard’s complex purpose is a knowledge leap unearned by prior experience.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    Calyx functions more as a mythic archetype than a fully realized character with internal contradictions. His surrender to the dream and the task is immediate, lacking a moment of reluctance or doubt that would give the "optimism" genuine weight. The "cost" of the blood sacrifice is ritualistic rather than an emotional or difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a specific individual; her interiority is summarized ("realized the interrupted journeys were not hers alone") rather than dramatized through friction. There are no difficult micro-choices on the page; her actions (kneeling, singing, planting) meet no resistance and reveal no contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—revealing truth vs. maintaining anonymity—is legible, but she feels more like a thematic vessel than a fully embodied character. The decision-making process is largely introspective summary ("wondering if the letter inside carried her real name") rather than dramatized through distinct micro-choices prior to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who lacks internal conflict or genuine vulnerability. Her "disguised wisdom" is stated and performed without a moment of doubt or struggle that would humanize the "super-competent" fable logic. The antagonist (lieutenant) pivots too easily at the climax, serving the plot rather than reacting from established character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the emotional landscape is conveyed through stylized metaphors ("paper lungs," "verbs too sharp") rather than embodied reaction, creating distance. The protagonist's pivotal choice is heavily facilitated by the medium, reducing the personal difficulty and friction of the apology.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s specific guilt regarding the mistranslation is compelling and grounds the surreal atmosphere. However, the drug-induced haze feels slightly like a device to justify overly poetic dialogue, and the boy's voice blends too seamlessly with the narrator’s own lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Luma is a proactive protagonist who drives the action through competence, but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. The emotional arc is smooth and linear; the "cost" of her actions is described metaphorically ("sigh of present sorrow") rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora functions effectively as a fable archetype, fitting the story’s mythic tone, but her interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("measured in sure strokes") rather than embodied emotion. The central motivation—trading certainty for curiosity—is stated as a philosophical proposition rather than dramatized through visceral struggle or hesitation, keeping her slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist relies on the mechanical repetition of the label "charming rogue scholar" rather than dramatized complexity or distinct traits. He lacks internal conflict or a credible flaw that jeopardizes his success; his "defiance" is stated abstractly rather than tested by a difficult, high-cost choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zale is a distinct, archetypal figure whose exhaustion ("hollowing blade") grounds the high-concept premise. His shift from passive guardian to active participant by planting the card is a clear, motivated turn that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira demonstrates strong agency through a clear sequence of choices that escalate in cost, culminating in a decisive self-sacrifice. While the "foxglove heart" metaphor creates a slight stylistic distance, her motivation is coherent and the emotional price of her duty is visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s defining trait ("carefully reckless") is pivotal, driving the closure choice to leave the inkwell behind. However, the narrative relies heavily on explicitly labeling this trait multiple times rather than trusting the dramatized action to convey it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mireya is a competent protagonist, but her internal landscape is functional rather than embodied; she serves primarily as a vehicle for the puzzle-solving plot. Her emotions are described ("reverence," "not tremble") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. The lack of personal cost or significant internal doubt leaves her characterization flat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies on summary and poetic labeling ("Archivist of Airborne Refrain") rather than embodied emotion or choice under immediate pressure. The protagonist’s internal state is described through metaphor ("fleeing smoldering paper trails") rather than dramatized reaction, creating distance that prevents genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Juniper’s interiority is rich and consistent with the lyrical tone, but her motivation remains largely intellectual ("needed to discover why") rather than viscerally pressured. While the internal logic holds, the lack of contradictory impulses or deeper emotional friction makes her journey feel more like a procedural unlocking of a puzzle than a character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, driving the ritual and accepting the conceptual cost of the atlas. Her internal shift from observer (astrologer) to participant (ceremony) is well-motivated by the established ache of exile.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira functions more as a poetic device than a psychological agent; her emotions are "transliterated" into colors (violet curiosity, indigo doubt), which reads as "label-only" description rather than embodied feeling. While she performs the ritual, the "micro-choices" are abstract gestures (arranging glass) without a clear, felt cost or internal conflict. The characterization relies on synesthetic adjectives rather than the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Cipher functions more as a catalyst than a fully realized protagonist; his ability to predict Rube Goldberg-esque chaos borders on magical competence, removing genuine struggle or risk. While his motivation is stated, it lacks an on-page emotional cost or internal contradiction until the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is clear and poetic, driving the ritualistic action effectively. However, the protagonist's internal state is conveyed almost exclusively through high-concept metaphor ("hips forecasting surf") rather than embodied psychology, creating a mythic distance that dampens visceral connection. Internal conflict is minimal; her resolution is absolute from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mara functions as a lyrical archetype rather than a grounded character; she faces no internal contradiction, doubt, or resistance. Her actions are ritualistic and competent, lacking the struggle or flawed decision-making that drives high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s internal arc is clear, and the physical scar effectively mirrors the psychological wound. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("fought flames the way other men fought lovers," "innocence became currency") rather than raw, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the visceral reality of his guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira functions as an archetypal "dreamer" rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is abstract ("needed hope itself to breathe") and lacks visceral grounding. Her central action—finding the equation—occurs without visible internal struggle or contradiction, making her a vessel for the concept rather than a messy, striving protagonist. The "cost" of her success (a drop of blood) feels symbolic rather than felt, leaving her emotional arc smooth and conflict-free.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is a functional focalizer whose sensory skills drive the plot, but the coincidence of her lineage feels convenient rather than earned. Her agency is largely subsumed by the setting's trap, which fits the genre but limits character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is compelling, grounded in a specific backstory trade (mother's laughter) that gives weight to the central conflict. The final choice to sacrifice her tool creates a meaningful arc. However, the attribute "perceptively calm" is applied as a repeated label rather than demonstrated through unique behavior, slightly flattening the character into a fable archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.0)
    Characterization relies on melodramatic shorthand ("names written in his own blood") and summarized traits ("operatively gentle") rather than idiosyncratic psychology. Kaelen functions as an archetypal vessel for the ritual, lacking the internal contradiction or specific behavioral nuance required for a literary protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's duality—cruelty laundered through charity versus secret sentimentality—is efficiently dramatized. The final choice to swallow the sound rather than merely hear it earns a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting him from a passive observer to a permanent vessel of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lys demonstrates strong agency, specifically in the final refusal of the weaver's cloak to accept the burden of waking the city. Her motivation is clear, though her interiority is occasionally distanced by heavy metaphor (e.g., "pulse feel like betrayal").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lucien is distinct, and his decision to "letter with questions" is a valid character turn. However, the required trait "uncommonly serene" operates as a repetitive label rather than a demonstrated behavior under pressure. The epiphany feels granted by the magic object rather than excavated from internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara is a competent focalizer whose internal state aligns perfectly with her external actions, creating a unified but somewhat static character portrait. While her motivation is clear, the lack of contradictory impulses or internal friction (she is purely aligned with her archetype from start to finish) limits the emotional complexity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s transition from bell-caster to rope-braider is compelling, grounding the magical ritual in a specific, lived history of guilt and craft. Internal motivation is vividly dramatized through the contrast between the "cheerful tune" of the smashed organ and the current "gentle wish." The emotional arc from self-forgiveness to the release of the names is coherent and moving.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic vessel rather than a character with embodied interiority or conflicting desires. Her trajectory feels predetermined by the "Council," lacking a moment of genuine agency or resistance that would define her personality beyond the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Naram-bel is a focused, consistent protagonist whose frugal nature and devotion to mathematics ground the mythic tone. The motivation to preserve knowledge against a regime change is compelling and clearly drives his choices. The mention of his sister, while attempting to add emotional depth, feels slightly perfunctory and less integrated than his professional passion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s transition from external healer to self-healer provides a clear arc, though the "scheming" trait reads more as strategic intent than a deep personality driver. The internal confrontation with the shadow is efficiently executed, but the resolution—metabolizing hatred into carbon—feels slightly abstract compared to the visceral memories of the soldier and girl.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, driving the plot through expertise and a visceral sacrifice (blood) that earns the resolution. Motivation is clear and embodied, though the "glass mountains of solitude" backstory feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized within the scene's present action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is distinct, but the prompt-mandated trait ("endearingly feisty") is applied as a label rather than dramatized through complex behavior. The internal conflict regarding the "forbidden" bag is resolved too quickly to generate character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara demonstrates strong agency, moving from bewilderment to active inquiry through specific, high-stakes choices. Her internal conflict between preserving her past and obeying the command is dramatized effectively via the memory-erasure mechanic. The transformation from curator to catalog is a earned shift in identity, grounded in her decision to ask the final question despite the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her agency drives every beat, from the rescue to the final sacrifice. However, the emotional cost of trading "a year of her death" feels abstract amidst the heavy metaphor; we see her resourceful actions, but her internal fear or exhaustion is obscured by the lyrical styling.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's duality is a compelling concept, but the internal conflict remains largely abstract ("every stride was an argument") rather than dramatized through distinct choices until the final recitation. The sister functions more as a symbolic weight than an active participant until the climax, limiting the emotional impact of their reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a competent archetypal vessel for the ritual rather than a character with internal contradictions or distinct desires. She faces no difficult choices or doubts; she understands the task instantly and executes it perfectly. While her expertise is established, the lack of struggle or personal cost limits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mapkeeper acts with competence and clear motivation (preservation of memory), anchoring the narrative effectively. However, the apprentice Jalen functions largely as a prop with limited agency or depth, and the mapkeeper’s interiority often relies on stylized metaphor rather than visceral emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated ("to prove that coincidences have meaning"), but it feels intellectual rather than visceral. Her internal struggle is minimal; the "curse" of retrocognition is described as a burden but functions purely as a convenient tool to solve the plot without extracting a visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s internal conflict—purity vs. amputation—is visceral and well-defined, driving the narrative arc effectively. Her decision to fracture the quill and sculpt a mosaic identity is a strong, character-defining choice that earns the resolution. The "borrowed self" concept is successfully embodied through her reactions to the memory pellets, grounding the abstract premise in emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Luma is a distinct, mythic protagonist, but the use of unestablished "silver dust" to bypass the sentry undercuts her specific skill set and agency. The internal cost of potential failure is stated but not deeply felt in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and consistent, though the daughter's rapid shift from estrangement to tearful laughter feels slightly convenient for the length. The required attribute "warmly observant" is explicitly labeled rather than purely demonstrated through a high-stakes observational choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is a distinct focalizer with a motivation that poignantly blends physical need with psychological trauma. Her interiority is vivid, though occasionally it relies on poetic assertion rather than grounded emotional texture. The final choice to release the silences rather than hoard them earns a strong character arc, marking a decisive shift from preservation to release.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nilo serves as a competent, consistent anchor, though his role is primarily catalytic until the final paragraph deepens his burden. The commuter provides the necessary emotional volatility, and their interaction effectively dramatizes the "lesson" of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who faces no internal contradiction or genuine flaw; she succeeds at every step without hesitation or error. While her motivation is clear, her emotional journey is flat, lacking the "crucible" of conflicting impulses or difficult micro-choices that define high-quality characterization. The realization at the end feels intellectual rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The shadow keeper's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on melodramatic assertions ("perverse art") rather than dramatized struggle. The ghost boy serves as a functional prop for the keeper's arc, offering little resistance or distinct personality before his sudden realization. The "tender" archetype feels familiar and safe, lacking the specific, gritty contradictions that would elevate the characterization beyond a role.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s agency is excellent; she actively drives the transformation rather than witnessing it, utilizing her specific past to solve the present crisis. The trait "virtuously mischievous" is a label-tell, but her subsequent actions (picking locks, twisting the bolt) dramatize it well enough to sustain the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Arin's motivation is clearly stated, but his interiority is suffocated by heavy metaphors ("carved purpose into marrow") rather than grounded emotional experience. The choice to sacrifice his name is accepted too easily, lacking the visible struggle or hesitation that would give the stakes weight. The character feels more like a thematic vessel than a living person navigating a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's arc is sharp and decisive; the transition from "withdrawn" observer to active participant via surrender is a compelling inversion. The motivation—shame and allegiance—is effectively dramatized through the physical act of the dance and the final trade. The cost of the choice is absolute and visceral, satisfying the requirement for high-stakes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rowan’s interiority is poignant and specific, grounding the “broken-hearted” descriptor in the concrete context of her emancipation and archival work. The choice to link the button to Marcus based on the date her uncle deployed is a compelling, character-defining leap of faith that dramatizes her need to repair the past. A slight weakness in the “reading dust” sequence relies on poetic projection rather than psychological grounding, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("underestimated rebel") rather than demonstrated traits; the protagonist's primary skill—reading frequency waveforms in puddles—reads as unearned clairvoyance rather than the "resourcefulness" claimed by the narrative. Motivation is stated explicitly in abstract terms ("tyranny of indifference") rather than dramatized through personal friction or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is fused beautifully with his physical action; the struggle is visceral and embodied in the technique of playing. His motivation—a desperate, Sisyphean defense against fate—is clear and compels the high-stakes choice to play the "erasure" note. The cost is palpable in his "raw throat" and the "distorted reflection" that leaves him trapped in his role.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mireya functions as a fable archetype rather than a fully realized protagonist; she lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her motivation shifts instantly from curiosity to crystallized purpose without cost or doubt. The emotional arc is frictionless, moving from discovery to resolution with unearned ease.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn focalizer with a clear internal struggle between routine and the desire for the unknown. The transition from tinkerer to mythic figure is earned by the fable-like tone, though the internal shift relies heavily on a single realization moment rather than cumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aurelia’s motivation—redeeming her brother’s name via alchemy—is clear and drives the scene. However, her interiority often relies on stylized abstraction ("heart-balance," "names echo longest") rather than visceral, embodied emotion, creating a slight distance. The shift from grief to "teaching" at the end feels more like a thematic necessity than a deeply earned character evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a competent professional executing a known ritual rather than a character under pressure. While her motivation is clear, there is no internal conflict, contradictory impulse, or personal cost to the healing process. The trait "modestly fearless" is applied as a label twice but never tested against genuine fear or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is abstract (“mathematics of mercy”) yet visibly embodied through pain and the “proprioceptive” struggle, grounding the intellectual quest in physical stakes. The choice to remove the strap is a clearly motivated act of agency that reclaims autonomy, even if the internal monologue occasionally prioritizes poetic philosophy over raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinct, and the connection to the younger self anchors the emotional arc effectively. However, the "translator" identity feels slightly like a functional hat rather than a lived reality, and the motivation is delivered via diagnostic statements ("I realize honoring...") rather than purely through the pressure of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a sharply drawn protagonist whose technical expertise convincingly filters her perception of the supernatural. The internal conflict between her identity as a fixer and her realization of futility drives a genuine renunciation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corwin's internal defect ("heart was a cracked chase") creates a distinct, character-specific motivation that drives the plot's central action. His agency is absolute; he actively dismantles his world to heal his own fracture, making the surreal stakes feel personal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia serves as a compelling mythic protagonist, her internal conflict (past failure vs. present hope) dramatized effectively through the ritual of the mirrors. Her specific "poet" identity informs her tactical choices, transforming abstract desire into concrete action. The sacrifice at the end feels earned by her backstory of "twenty years in a lunar quarry" and her confession of failure, though her dissolution leans slightly into symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but the emotional turning point—the confession to the rust—feels performative rather than visceral. The protagonist offers his "unvarnished self" with little resistance or internal struggle, resulting in a transaction that lacks the messiness of genuine character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ivy’s characterization is vivid and efficient; the trait of "sensibly eccentric" is immediately grounded in the waistcoat of vials. Her reaction to terror—"politeness excused it"—reveals a specific, resilient coping mechanism that informs her final, costly choice to sacrifice her life’s work. The arc from collector to conduit is earned through this active release.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and consistent with the artistic persona, but the "spirited" trait from the prompt feels at odds with the character's meditative, stoic demeanor. The choice to drown the GPS is a strong character beat that defines her values.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.6)
    Liora functions more as a thematic vessel than a fully realized character. Her "old grief" is a "label-only" emotion; it is stated as an abstract "slow drip" but never dramatized with specific memory, loss, or consequence, making the emotional arc feel unearned. Her motivation is philosophical rather than visceral, leading to a passive internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya’s motivation is intensely specific, grounding the archivist archetype in personal grief. The internal conflict—betraying her own future potential to redeem the past—is dramatized through the tangible exchange with the lagoon, resulting in a felt, embodied cost ("years rearrange inside me") that earns the final decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemist’s motivation is distinctly rendered through the specific cost of solitude; the refusal of the bottle is an earned character beat that defines their integrity against the "false comfort" of the wish.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ambrose is a deeply realized focalizer; his unique capability (dead languages) and professional burden (archiving oaths) are tightly woven into his interiority. The shift from intending to silence the prophecy to accepting his role as the city’s vessel is a profound internal change earned by the specific memory of the field trip. The backstory of the mother’s lullaby efficiently grounds his fantastical skill in emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is sharply defined by her burden and expertise, grounded by the specific memory of the "names of every gardener." Her agency is absolute; she rejects the binary choice offered by the vortex (preservation vs. surrender) and invents a third path ("circulation") with a visceral, embodied cost—hosting the spiral in her own heartbeat. The emotional resonance of becoming the "axis" is felt without needing extensive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s internal conflict between civic duty and spiritual listening is well-dramatized, grounded effectively in the memory of her father. Her motivation is consistent, though the phrase "credibly curious" reads as a forced label rather than organic characterization. The choice to switch the feed is earned, though the "tug" from the mountain slightly diminishes her agency by making the decision external.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's arc of grief and transformation is clear, and the internal shift is legible. However, interiority often relies on abstract labels ("soft meteor of grief," "spiritually curious") rather than embodied sensation, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is defined by static labels ("astonished," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than behavior, creating dissonance between the "astonished" tag and his tranquil, long-term habituation. While the final choice is motivated, the internal arc is largely told via these conflicting adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clearly dramatized, moving from a desire to quantify to a willingness to exchange. The renunciation of the urn fragment—a cherished relic—provides a visible, felt cost that validates his internal shift. While the interaction with the boy functions well, the protagonist's transition feels slightly more like a guided realization than a high-friction struggle against his own nature.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized figure lacking internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; he performs a thematic function rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The interaction with the woman lacks friction or status dynamics, resulting in an instant, unearned harmony that flattens the dramatic arc. The attribute "warmly attentive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through distinct, costly observation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is a compelling, highly competent focalizer whose stoic reframing of death ("not a death sentence but a deadline") drives the narrative with immense agency. While her singular focus creates a strong forward momentum, the lack of visible internal doubt or conflicting impulses makes her emotional arc somewhat linear, though the physical cost ("hands shook") effectively grounds the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dr. Voss is a sharply defined focalizer; the "cyanotype rinse" and "iron tang" memories ground her skepticism in visceral, character-specific detail. Her choice to activate the amber is motivated by a clear internal hypothesis, driving the narrative to a decisive psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a distinct, competent archetype fitting the fable mode, but lacks internal conflict or doubt. Choices are procedural (enacting a ritual) rather than dramatic trade-offs; the physical cost (bleeding tongue) adds texture but the outcome feels predetermined by his expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Scraps is a distinct focalizer, but her motivation ("translate distance into closeness") feels abstractly thematic rather than embodied. The brother functions as a prop, speaking in poetic riddles ("Name me and I am already home") immediately upon rescue rather than reacting with human naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s internal state of grief is rendered with poetic density, establishing a strong emotional baseline. However, his "blessed pariah" status and "guilt of surviving" function more as atmospheric labels than active drivers of choice until the climax. He is largely reactive to the supernatural phenomena, following the breadcrumbs of the compass and voice rather than driving the scene through conflicting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vespers is a compelling archetype, perfectly suited to the fable-like mode, but she lacks internal conflict or genuine flaws. Her competence is absolute—she "amuses" the wind and easily outmaneuvers the antagonist—which lowers the dramatic tension and psychological depth expected at the highest tier. The "passing of the torch" adds a layer of motivation, but her struggle remains external and symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's trajectory from performative grief to authentic preservation is psychologically acute, creating a compelling internal landscape. Kestrel's pivot is grounded in their shared history of "rehearsed terror," making his transition from enforcer to participant feel earned by character depth rather than plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's physiology (mercury-glass skin) is not just aesthetic but integral to the plot, serving as both the source of her curse and the tool for her liberation. Her motivation—to reclaim memory by shedding the prophecy that poisoned it—is distinct, creating a strong internal conflict that drives the narrative. The final choice to wound herself and destroy the talents rather than submit to the custodian’s cage is a high-cost, character-defining moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marek’s internal conflict is clear, but the pivotal psychological shift relies on diagnostic interiority ("realized the... labyrinth... was not a lock... but a mirror") rather than dramatized struggle. The "fierce repose" is stated as a feeling rather than shown through action or sensory immediacy, slightly distancing the reader from the change. The connection between his guilt and the specific "suicidal" chess strategy is a strong character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is sharp and immediately actionable, driving the scene’s pressure. The pivot from defiant projection to humble listening is rapid but earned by the canyon’s supernatural feedback loop. Her internal state is vividly rendered, though the specific trait "innocently mischievous" feels slightly tonally dissonant with the gravity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s internal conflict—survival versus meaning—is dramatized effectively through the physical cost of her ritual, grounding the stakes in her body. While the "mother’s heartbeat in a locket" motivation is a familiar trope, the specific execution via kintsugi and mercury feels specific and tactile. Her final choice to sacrifice herself for the statue is a decisive, character-defining moment that earns the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ren is a distinct, realized protagonist whose transition from an "intimately aloof" observer to a participant in his own legacy is earned through specific, costly action. The final choice to leave the painting behind is a profound character beat that validates the "temporary eternity" motive without needing dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and consistent, grounding the magical realism in felt emotion. However, the emotional palette relies heavily on labeled intensity ("screaming tenderness," "brutal shout") rather than varied, embodied nuance, making the character's state feel asserted at maximum volume throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is a vivid archetypal figure whose physical form ("stitched... from maps") perfectly externalizes the internal conflict of grief. Her transformation from navigator to offering serves as a strong, earned climax driven by renunciation. While the "patchwork" nature is metaphorical, the physical costs (burning fingertips, weeping mercury) ground her agency in visceral reality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between the desire for "rational" safety and the inevitability of feeling is masterfully dramatized. The shift from suppression to witnessing is earned through specific sensory pressures and a decisive final action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maris is drawn with stark, specific interiority that grounds the surreal premise in character logic. The shift from passive observer to active agent is earned, and the specific emotional cost paid at the end—trading her own memories to settle the stranger's debt—gives her "eccentric" role genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("lonely," "no passion") rather than demonstrated behavior. The attribute "empirically intuitive" reads as a contradictory authorial patch to justify his sudden acceptance of magic, rather than a trait that shapes a specific, grounded methodology. The protagonist feels like a generic vessel for the plot, lacking specific internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The queen's internal arc from resistance to resignation is well-dramatized, with the stakes of memory loss effectively grounding her motivation. The realization that the antagonist is her future self deepens the characterization beyond a standard quest archetype, anchoring the loop in character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Corin’s internal conflict is legible, and the shift from commercial preservation to authentic presence drives the arc. However, the reliance on the "scientifically romantic" label to define his psychology feels diagnostic rather than dramatized, and the "palette of resolve" moment leans into abstract interiority over embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rendered with exquisite, achingly specific detail, grounding the surreal premise in felt emotion. Her motivation—to distill chaos—clashes meaningfully with her surrender to the cycle, creating a strong arc of renunciation. The "jealousy" of past selves is internalized well, though primarily through narration rather than interaction. The final choice to offer the scroll to the snow feels fully earned by her struggle with the "feral nostalgia."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Character interiority is vivid, effectively mapping the sensory shift from scent to touch. However, the central epiphany—divining a specific midwife's prayer and history solely from scratches on a screw—reads as unearned psychic insight rather than a grounded deduction, stretching credibility within the story's otherwise realistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lina’s internal conflict is viscerally embodied; the physical crystallization of her breath serves as a perfect objective correlative for her grief. Her motivation—to transform trauma into narrative—is clear, urgent, and drives every micro-choice under pressure. The resolution feels earned by her persistence through the pain of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—professional cynicism versus personal grief—is compelling, and the motivation to atone drives the narrative clearly. However, the reliance on performative metaphors ("Grief is a violin without strings") creates a slight distance, making the emotion feel occasionally stylized rather than visceral. The sister’s ghost serves as a strong reactive force, though the "gossip-column" persona feels more like a voice wrapper than a driver of tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    The character functions well as a mythic archetype but lacks grounded interiority or contradictory impulses. Her motivation is stated ("left her motivation naked") rather than dramatized through resistance, and she follows the library's ritualistic instructions without significant personal agency or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Torvald’s internal landscape is rich, blending professional duty with the raw ache of grief. The transition from observer to participant is grounded in his backstory (the daughter), providing emotional weight to the surreal events. However, the final transformation feels slightly more intellectualized than embodied, resolving into a philosophical stance rather than a purely character-driven emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya is a compelling protagonist whose professional competence ("intrusion detection") seamlessly integrates with her personal grief. Her "spatial gift" provides a unique lens for interiority, grounding abstract emotions in concrete geometry. The emotional arc—from clinical observer to grieving sister—is earned, though the climax relies heavily on her specific attribute acting as a near-magical solution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Character motivation is distinct and the father's presence is felt, but the pivotal emotional shift relies on summary ("She realized the scrawls were not directions") rather than dramatized experience. The transition from judgment to forgiveness feels slightly rushed and diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s transition from "cultivated estrangement" to active engagement is compelling and well-charted. The internal conflict—duty versus the desire to break the cycle—manifests clearly in the final choice to ignore the "actual emergency." The relationship with the caller serves as an effective crucible, forcing the protagonist to confront their own stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist is a clearly defined focalizer with a coherent motivation (preservation) and a meaningful internal cost (the locket). However, the emotional bridge between the drowned boy and her daughter relies on a coincidental age match rather than a developed causal link, making the climactic sacrifice feel slightly calculated rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kit is a distinct, voiced protagonist with a clear emotional baseline ("desperately jocular armor"). However, the summary-heavy middle distances the reader from his specific internal struggle during the station's transformation, turning him into a facilitator rather than a character in a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is established, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("grief," "longing") rather than embodied particulars. The character acts as a vessel for the concept; the "fear" of his interior is stated but resolved quickly by the ring's magic without a dramatized struggle or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a distinct focalizer with rich interiority, though her defining trait ("confidently uncertain") is delivered more as a label than a behavior earned through friction. The emotional arc resolves smoothly via the tool, bypassing the deeper struggle of living with the error.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype lacking interiority or contradiction; he performs a magical ritual without facing resistance, difficult choices, or personal cost, resulting in a character who acts as a vessel for the premise rather than a human agent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by abstract labels ("analytically intuitive," "volcanic tenderness") rather than demonstrated traits. Her internal conflict is resolved via a magical realization from an external object rather than an earned psychological shift or active choice. The emotions are stated ("volcanic tenderness") rather than embodied in reaction or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s agency is strong, driven by a clear desire for autonomy that evolves into communal acceptance through action (drumming, slowing tempo). However, the pivotal emotional shift relies on diagnostic interiority ("pierced her with tender accountability") rather than dramatized struggle, which slightly softens the earned nature of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is competent and her specialized skills (identifying walks) ground her well. However, her sudden knowledge of the specific "whisper challenge" to open a door sealed for decades—despite earlier claiming the key was lost—feels convenient and lowers the sense of genuine discovery or struggle. The lack of interpersonal friction leaves the dynamic feeling purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is a consistent, mythic figure whose motivation—redemption for a lost child—clearly drives the ritual. However, her interiority relies heavily on summarized emotion ("learned silent empathy") rather than conflicting impulses in the moment. The "spiralingly calm" attribute is displaced onto the air, missing an opportunity to ground her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is a distinct presence, but she functions more as a poetic vessel than a grounded character; her motivation ("planting forests of second thoughts") is abstract and lacks visceral urgency. The transition from finding the box to organizing window displays relies on "rehearsed in dreams" logic rather than earned character decision-making. There is minimal internal conflict or hesitation, making her actions feel frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira is a vivid, active protagonist with a clear internal conflict (the struggle to adapt to tenderness after a life of survival). Her motivation to save the community by transforming their relationship to the land is strong. The transition from isolation to leading the collective feels slightly rapid, relying on the "song" as a universal solvent rather than interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's specific method of coping—narrating mundane tasks—provides a strong, idiosyncratic anchor for her internal state. Her shift from performance to genuine engagement (planting the stems) is earned and affecting. The "moral ambiguity" trait is largely relegated to backstory rather than dramatized in a present-tense choice, which slightly softens the complexity of the current moment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist functions effectively as a mythic archetype, embodying the story's themes of transformation and fluidity. However, she lacks internal contradiction or vulnerability; her "tremor of certainty" removes the possibility of doubt, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Milo’s longing for color is tangible and drives the narrative arc effectively, with the shift from painting to arranging earning his character growth. Rosa functions well as an archetypal mentor, though her "innocently cunning" trait feels like a pasted-on label rather than a behavior demonstrated through complex choices. The relationship serves the fable-like structure, but the emotional connection relies on shared archetypes rather than intimate, dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic archetype (the wise healer) rather than a character under pressure; she arrives possessing the thematic answer and faces no internal doubt, struggle, or genuine cost. The "collectors" are prop-like foils who capitulate instantly, preventing any meaningful relational dynamics or status shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for a pre-determined lesson than a living character grappling with contradictory impulses in the moment. Her emotional journey is retrospective; she begins the scene with her resolution ("Tonight, she would illuminate...") already fully formed, resulting in a ritual execution rather than a dramatic struggle with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is vividly embodied through specific physical details like the "onyx-ink" fingers and "blackened thumbnail." Her motivation—an intellectual hunger to map the collapse—is distinct and drives the action, though the internal conflict is somewhat linear; she executes her intent without significant hesitation or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for thematic assertion than a living person; emotions are labeled ("anguished joy") rather than embodied. Motivation shifts from purification to teaching without a dramatized internal struggle or visceral cost, relying instead on abstract realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira is a compelling focalizer with deep interiority and a clear, high-stakes motivation. The transition from a "scholar's quest" to a "daughter's promise" provides a strong internal pivot that justifies the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character interiority is vivid, with emotions embodied in specific actions (burning notes, peeling the ring). However, the motivation is explicitly diagnosed in a tell-heavy sentence ("motivation, suddenly twin-born, was to balance...") rather than emerging solely through the ritual, which distances the reader slightly at the pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is visceral and deeply embodied; the protagonist's desire for closure is felt through physical sensations ("tasting iron") and the willingness to self-harm for a trade. The choice to reopen the wound is a definitive, character-revealing action that earns the resolution. Internal conflict regarding the sister's laugh ("tried to forget because it hurt more") adds necessary emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s internal state is clearly drawn, but her primary trait ("spatially imaginative") functions as a label for visualization rather than a tool for tactical problem-solving. Her emotional arc relies on asserted sentiment ("believing unused love might crystallize") rather than embodied contradictory impulses or difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetypal fable figure, and her physical dismantling of the instrument creates a strong, embodied action sequence. However, her motivation is grounded in a cliché backstory ("teachers replaced crayon nebulae with long division") that lacks specific, individuated nuance, relying on a stock trope of creativity versus conformity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is competent and distinct, fitting the &quot;dreamless&quot; archetype well, but lacks internal contradiction or struggle. He acts as a procedural vessel for the ritual rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure; his certainty lowers the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions well as a fable archetype, and the choice to sacrifice the gear is a clear, decisive action. However, interiority is often abstract or symbolic ("equations older than rust") rather than deeply embodied, creating a distance that lowers the emotional stakes of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on archetypal labels ("wise," "young") rather than behavior. The internal realization of the hound ("courage... within all along") is an unearned epiphany that resolves the conflict instantly without struggle or psychological cost. Head-hopping between the guides and the hound dilutes the emotional center.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") is compelling and clearly dramatized through the interaction with the recruit. The backstory of the mother's lullaby effectively anchors the internal stakes. The choice to pass the bolt acts as a strong character-defining moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a static archetype of competence with no internal conflict, vulnerability, or contradictory impulses. His motivation ("balance") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and he faces no meaningful risk or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a legible focalizer with clear motivation, though her emotional landscape relies somewhat on "witness" archetypes rather than specific interior friction. The coincidence that her personal tapping code matches the ancient reef's frequency undermines her agency; the connection feels granted by destiny rather than earned by character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is clearly motivated, but she functions as a romanticized archetype rather than a psychological entity; her "awkward confidence" is stated rather than tested, and she achieves her goals without facing internal friction or paying a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Nara’s voice and internal motivation ("intent to evolve") are vivid and distinct, grounding the fantastic elements. However, the antagonist (guard) serves as a prop who is neutralized too easily, lacking the friction of a fully realized opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is vividly embodied through the somatic markers, grounding the grief. However, the explicit self-labeling ("People say I am quietly talented") and the declarative emotional summary ("My motivation is...") read as artificial prompt insertions rather than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's motivation (grief) is clear and drives the ritualistic action effectively. The internal monologue is vivid, though the emotional arc is slightly distanced by the heavy stylization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist relies heavily on the repeated diagnostic label "serene anger" (used four times) rather than dramatized emotional complexity. While the motivation to find the sister is clear, Kael's internal life feels reduced to prompt-driven tags rather than organic psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("bravely conflicted") and theatrical self-definition ("half ice, half fire") rather than embodied feeling. The protagonist's internal state is stated rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions more as a thematic vehicle than a conflicted protagonist; her "senselessly perceptive" trait is told rather than demonstrated through costly observation. The internal struggle between violence and peace is resolved via exposition ("unlike him, she had chosen her mother's path") rather than a dramatized micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s competence is established immediately and tested under pressure; she refuses the goddess’s demand with a specific, character-rooted counter-move (silence). Her interiority is focused and "cool-headed" as promised, though the emotional cost ("unsung nights") feels slightly abstract compared to the visceral physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Cordelia is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict (legacy vs. truth) is externalized effectively through the magical mechanics. Her choice to sacrifice the rosewood nib—the sole relic of her family's history—demonstrates clear agency and pays a visible, felt cost that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is visceral, anchored in physical sensation (the itching collarbone) and specific memory. The climax is driven by a character-specific action (inking the console) rather than a generic choice, grounding the resolution in her unique skill set.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, though the "whimsical" label feels slightly performative. The "socially perceptive" trait is applied abstractly to nature and silence rather than to interpersonal dynamics, which makes the characterization feel slightly forced to fit the prompt. The emotional arc is coherent, leading to a valid internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is compelling, but the pivotal transformation from "gentle radical" to "Iron Cradle" is delivered via summarized backstory rather than dramatized choice in the present. The "Iron Cradle" persona is strong, but the retrospective nature of her evolution reduces the immediate emotional cost of the scene's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation (stitching unraveling memory) is visceral and drives every beat of the ritual. The protagonist's internal longing is beautifully particularized, and the interaction with Lila provides a necessary external challenge that sharpens his agency without overshadowing it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on expository summary ("Now she understood why...") rather than dramatized behavior. Mira encounters no internal resistance or genuine cost; her transition from skepticism to "willowglass hope" is stated rather than earned through struggle. The lack of a specific, on-page price for her success leaves her feeling like a plot device rather than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aera is a competent, purpose-driven focalizer whose motivation aligns perfectly with the plot. However, she lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is one of linear discovery rather than difficult choice or self-overcoming, which limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for the fable-like premise rather than a grounded character with internal contradictions. Her journey is one of smooth acquisition of wisdom without the friction of competing internal desires or character-specific flaws. The emotions ("quietly inspired," "feeling weight return") remain abstract and serve the allegory rather than revealing a distinct human psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, though the shift from "prudent" to "daring" relies heavily on stated exposition rather than purely dramatized choice. The emotional arc of redemption is clear, but the "scarred nerves" and "weight of nations" tropes feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman functions well as a mythic archetype, and his surrender of the stories creates a legible, costly arc. While the emotional interiority is stylized rather than visceral, the sacrifice of his identity ("coachman no longer") lands with weight. The character choreography is precise, though the lack of hesitation or conflicting impulses makes the resolution feel slightly inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lin functions as an archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a distinct character with internal friction. The "zen-minded" trait acts as a buffer against struggle, resulting in a protagonist who observes and acts correctly without doubt or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is distinct and poetic, and her internal landscape is vivid. However, the secondary character (the boy) functions largely as a prop for her benevolence rather than a fully realized agent. The internal monologue relies heavily on metaphor ("sloshed like a heartbeat"), which occasionally distances the reader from her immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is vivid, and the physicalization of her emotions (the crack in the sternum) anchors the abstract motivation. However, the motivation itself ("to translate isolation into independence") feels slightly like a prompt label pasted over the character's psyche rather than a fully organic desire.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on metaphor rather than embodied emotion. The characterization stumbles with the "inevitably whimsical" laugh, which reads as an authorial label rather than a demonstrated trait. While functional for a fable, the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a living presence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra is a highly competent protagonist whose specific expertise drives every beat. The pivotal choice to abandon the clean sine wave for the "warped field-recording" effectively dramatizes her internal shift from control to embracing chaos, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's specific phobia (claustrophobia) and coping mechanism (sea shanties) create immediate, embodied interiority that drives the scene. Her professional competence balances her fear, and the final choice to seal the tunnels represents a character-specific trade-off, though the moment of hesitation is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Juniper’s face-blindness functions effectively as both a constraint and a thematic engine. Her internal drive is clear, though the "Method" monologue ("Method sang: unify opposites") feels slightly artificial, bordering on authorial intrusion rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and abstract labels (“gravitational pull of legacy”) rather than dramatized emotion. The attribute "nervously confident" is applied as a static label to her hands in a way that contradicts the action (trembling), creating a confusing image rather than a distinct trait.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    The fiddler serves as a compelling mythic archetype with a clearly defined motivation ("sculpt possibility"). However, her interiority is often displaced by heavy metaphor, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's conceit than a living person navigating a dilemma. The emotional cost (her father's memory) is stated but resolved through magical competence rather than difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.7)
    Character motivations are clear and the contrast between Jonah’s inherited grief and Mara’s corporate burnout is compelling. However, the connection between them relies heavily on summarized exchange ("Mara spoke of pivot tables... Jonah answered with stories") rather than dramatized friction or discovery in the moment. The emotional calibration feels slightly too perfect, with two strangers instantly syncing into a shared ritual without testing each other.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    The chronicler functions as a thematic vessel rather than a person; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct interiority, or resistance. The boy is a pure prop designed to elicit sentiment, lacking agency or human specificity. Emotional beats, like the boy’s sudden relief, feel performed rather than earned by character dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is viscerally embodied; the shift from guarded isolation to the vulnerability of confession is earned through specific physical and emotional costs (the seed, the kneeling).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "root-bound visionary" archetype is compelling, and the final sacrifice feels earned by the established identity. However, the "child-me" encounter functions as a generic beat that briefly flattens the unique psychological landscape into a standard trope.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and visceral, driven by a specific trauma. The protagonist's internal state is embodied well ("holes that whistled," "memories leak out"), and the choice to sacrifice the mother's memory carries genuine emotional weight. Lira's sudden physical decline effectively dramatizes the cost of the transaction, though the shift to "witness" at the end feels slightly accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mason is a vivid, specific archetype with a compelling backstory that informs his present actions. His technical competence with the microphone grounds the emotional arc well. However, the internal shift from humiliation to epiphany relies heavily on the external prop (the note) rather than purely internal pressure or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s internal landscape is rich, and her motivation to resolve her mother’s “haunted ambition” drives the narrative effectively. Her specific skillset (translation) is integrated well into her problem-solving method, though her “kindly methodical” nature feels slightly more stated than dramatized until the mother’s echo mirrors it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist is conceptually distinct, blending mechanical and biological traits effectively ("brass rib-cage," "bamboo creel"). Her motivation is clear and drives the ritual, though the "children" stake feels slightly abstract compared to the visceral, embodied cost of the "hollow" chest she accepts at closure. The internal shift is well-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and the surrender to the cave feels earned by her established motivation to heal connection. However, the lack of active resistance or a moment of agonizing doubt before the transformation softens the dramatic tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lila is a compelling, specific focalizer whose internal landscape (the &quot;river chronicler&quot;) meshes perfectly with the external action. The choice to sacrifice the accordion is a deeply earned moment of renunciation that manifests the cost of her transition on the page. Internal conflict regarding her medication and memory is embodied in physical action rather than just abstract thought.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist has a clear motivation (reclaiming her voice), but her interiority is stifled by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The emotion "cautious exuberance" is a "label-only feeling" that tells rather than shows, failing to embody the complex state of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is distinct, blending professional detachment with sensory vulnerability. The shift from observer to "arsonist" is compelling, though the telepathic plant "anchoring her to the decision" slightly undermines her agency at the climax, making the final choice feel partially coerced by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and poetic, driving the ritualistic action effectively toward a high-cost choice. However, the interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction ("city’s grief pressing against her ribs") rather than embodied, individuated friction, making the character feel more like a mythic archetype than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist has clear agency, but her internal arc feels more mythic than psychological; "forgiving the unforgivable" is summarized backstory rather than a dramatized struggle. The boy functions as a symbolic prop rather than a fully realized character, making the relational stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s agency is excellent; her decision to reject the standard transaction and leave unpaid constitutes a strong, character-driven pivot. The internal shift is well-supported by physical cues (the trembling hands), though the initial definition of her role feels slightly more conceptual than embodied. The interaction with the geologist effectively dramatizes the "crucible" requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Character motives drive the scene, but emotional states are often summarized with labels ("desperation") rather than dramatized in action. Marcus's acceptance of his fate is a strong closure beat, though his internal journey to that point is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.9)
    Cael functions as a mythic archetype rather than a realized character, lacking internal contradiction or specific human desire beyond the prompt's abstract quest. His interiority is summarized through labels ("historically reverent") rather than demonstrated through choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian’s defining trait—underachievement—is brilliantly leveraged as the specific competency needed to solve the crisis (mist walking, accepting partial solutions), making the resolution deeply character-specific. The sacrifice of his status (the badge) is a decisive renunciation with visible, earned cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jin’s motivation to find the "color of sound" is distinct and drives the narrative, but he functions more as a fable archetype than a conflicted human presence. The resolution feels granted by the magical mechanism of the safe rather than earned through a high-cost personal choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s final sacrifice is a compelling, high-stakes choice that earns the ending. However, her internal state relies too heavily on inserted labels (“quietly enthusiastic”) rather than embodied reaction, making her feel occasionally like a vessel for prompt terms rather than a living focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal arc is compelling, shifting from a passive instrument of death to a conscious vessel of sacrifice through a specific, earned memory. The contradictory impulses—desiring to know the fear yet buckling under its weight—are dramatized effectively in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael serves as an effective fable archetype, and his transition from "lukewarm mage" to the enduring "keeper of the drip" anchors the narrative arc. However, the reliance on a "years passed" summary to depict his lifelong sacrifice distances the reader from the visceral cost of that devotion, rendering his struggle more stated than felt in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marisol is a coherent focalizer with a distinct voice, but her emotional processing leans heavily on therapeutic abstraction ("evidence of choice," "private grief") rather than embodied reaction. The discovery of her father's infidelity dissolves too quickly into a generalized desire for public history, bypassing the messy, irrational friction of personal betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear agency and motivation, driving the ritual and the final choice. However, the internal conflict is often externalized into abstract concepts ("Logic said," "Intuition hummed") rather than deeply embodied psychology, and the "secretly sentimental" trait acts more as a label than a source of complex friction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between duty and intuition is well-rendered, culminating in a clear renunciation of her role. However, the antagonist/mirror figure (the older self) functions more as a symbolic prop than a distinct character, reducing the relational pressure to a solipsistic exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara and Zero are distinct archetypes whose synthesis is earned by the narrative logic, but the "ego death" backstory relies on diagnostic labeling rather than embodied experience, slightly flattening the opening interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is defined by immediate compliance rather than struggle; she accepts the seed's supernatural threat without hesitation, reducing agency. The backstory of the "fugue" functions as a convenient device to bypass the mystery of the note's origin. While her actions to guide the vines show competence, the lack of internal conflict or difficult trade-offs limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is viscerally embodied in the "leaf-blower symphony" identity, grounding grief in specific action. The internal state drives the plot, though the transition from grief to conductor is slightly whimsical.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's feral nature is effectively juxtaposed with her past as a cataloguer, creating a distinct, consistent internal logic. Her motivation to "befriend uncertainty" drives the narrative, though her internal monologue occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy that feels slightly less grounded in her physical, feral reality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined by label-heavy traits ("stoically sensitive") rather than dramatized complexity. While the sacrifice of sight for insight is a strong closure choice, the internal landscape feels archetypal and governed by the prompt's checklist rather than organic character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype than a fully realized individual; her interiority is primarily expository regarding the magic system. The pivotal internal shift—discarding assumptions—reads as a procedural checklist rather than a dramatized psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arden is a compelling focalizer whose "resiliently positive" trait functions as both a shield and a weapon in the climax. His choice to accept the "permanent transient life" is earned by the narrative arc, though the backstory about his mother feels slightly perfunctory and less integrated than his immediate drive to save the passengers.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her interiority consists of abstract labels ("unsettling calm," "fevered mind") rather than embodied emotion. The "composite man" is a symbolic device rather than a character who exerts genuine pressure, reducing the interaction to allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between grief and duty is compelling and resolved through a decisive act of renunciation. Her choice to gift the chain link—her last tether to the past—to the student perfectly dramatizes her shift from mourning to legacy. The emotional logic is tight and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a competent protagonist with clear motivation and agency, demonstrated when she outmaneuvers the Director. However, the "illicit thrill" trait is stated more than dramatized, and her internal monologue occasionally drifts into functional exposition to explain the world rather than revealing deep character idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but the claustrophobia acts as atmospheric flavor rather than a constraint that forces a hard choice; the gold fleck resolves her panic instantly. The rescue process feels ritualistic and inevitable rather than a struggle against genuine resistance, lacking a moment where she must prioritize the mission over her safety.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s internal state is vivid, but the pivotal realization (“I understand the second half of the lesson”) arrives via magical consumption of ink rather than earned struggle. The “wisdom” feels downloaded rather than forged in conflict, slightly flattening the agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is a compelling mythic archetype, and her physical nature (copper veins, wires) is integrated beautifully into the plot’s climax. Motivation is singular and clear ("feared silence more"), driving a high-stakes sacrifice. While her heroism is somewhat static—she accepts her fate with little wavering—the physical cost is dramatized viscerally. The "statue" outcome feels earned by the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her transition from skepticism to surrender is too rapid to feel earned; the "betrayal" is stated rather than dramatized. The internal conflict dissolves instantly, making her choice to shed humanity feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Calla functions as a competent archetype perfectly suited to the task, lacking the internal contradiction or flawed decision-making required for higher bands. While her motivation is clear, her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or costly choice; she faces no genuine moment of doubt or conflicting impulse that defines her character beyond her role.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Riven is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his journey lacks internal conflict or hesitation; he moves through the plot as a vessel for the concept rather than a character making difficult, contradictory choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is consistent but functions more as a poetic vessel than a fully realized character; his motivation ("interpret silence as possibility") is abstract and thematic rather than visceral. While his choice to "sing with memory" provides a resolution, the lack of distinct personality traits or internal contradiction leaves him feeling distant. The characterization relies heavily on the "silent" attribute without deepening the human cost of that silence beyond metaphorical description.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by her role and routine rather than specific, pressurized choices. "Sanely eccentric" serves as a label rather than a dramatized trait, and she faces no internal conflict or competence limits; she functions as a flawless operator of the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mireya serves as a functional archetype rather than a fully realized character; her "fierce" motivation is stated but not tested by genuine struggle. She accepts the central risk ("trading a memory") instantly without weighing the cost, and her interiority relies on abstract labels ("hollowed by absence") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is mythic and clear, though interiority relies on the repeated label "improbable longing" rather than contradictory, embodied emotion. The archetype sustains the fable mode effectively, and the physical sacrifice of the hair is a strong character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is distinct, with a professional competence that grounds the surrealism. Her pivot from victimhood (stolen memories) to agency (offered surrender) is a strong internal arc. However, the epiphany ("Habits are just stories...") feels slightly downloaded rather than actively forged in the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s specific compulsions (walking backwards, annotating reality) ground her abstract role in physical behavior, creating a distinct and embodied protagonist. Her internal conflict between preservation and memory drives the plot effectively, though the child functions more as a catalyst and symbol than a fully realized second agent with independent interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    Arin functions as a fable archetype ("wise pruner") rather than a nuanced character with internal contradictions. His motivation is singular and noble without complicating flaws; the realization at the climax ("Arin understood then") feels instantaneous and unearned by prior internal struggle. The "insatiably creative" trait acts as a label rather than a demonstrated driver of difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian is a functional protagonist whose role defines his identity, but he lacks deep internal contradiction or grit. His motivation ("to give voices back") is noble but realized through smooth, low-cost actions rather than difficult choices. The interaction with the spirit is gentle and cooperative, devoid of the friction that reveals character depth under pressure.

    Elara’s internal landscape is vivid and distinct, defined by a "methodically curious" nature that drives the narrative. Her shift from analytical conquest to empathetic "witnessing" constitutes a meaningful change in stance, though the motivation is articulated through abstract concepts rather than visceral need.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, but her agency is diluted at the climax; Elias provides the crucial insight ("the secret was not aerodynamic but contractual") that solves her problem, making her reactive rather than driving the resolution through her own struggle. The connection to her great-grandmother grounds her motivation, but the emotional release feels somewhat intellectually engineered rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lyra's internal state is largely conveyed through abstract metaphors ("syllables of loneliness") rather than embodied psychology. While the externalization of her conflict via the "echo" is functional, the resolution is summarized rather than dramatized; the echo surrenders immediately after one line of dialogue, bypassing the necessary struggle or genuine cost of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s internal landscape is rich, and her transition from ascending servant to subterranean gardener is a meaningful, character-driven arc. However, her agency wavers in the middle act; environmental serendipity (the specific angle of light, the wind opening the lock) solves the intellectual puzzles for her, reducing her role to an observer until the final choice to descend.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation—preserving memory against the void—is poignant and drives her agency even in the face of death. Her calm resolve dramatizes the "quietly explosive" trait effectively, though the trait itself is applied somewhat mechanically in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's condition drives the narrative effectively, but the interiority often drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("limitation is not failure but filter") rather than embodied experience. The final epiphany about painting her own face feels conceptually imposed by the author rather than organically discovered through the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira is a clear, consistent focalizer with a defined yearning ("sociable isolation"). However, her success relies on possession of a convenient object rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice; she gains acceptance without paying an emotional or tactical price, which flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rowan's internal grief coheres beautifully with his external goal; the shift from locksmith to custodian is a satisfying, character-driven evolution. His motivation to mend the universe to fix his own heart is compelling, though the connection is slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her transition from observer to active participant is well-charted. However, the shift in the colonists' trust is smoothed over; the "doubt" mentioned is resolved largely through summary competence rather than deep interpersonal friction or dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is strongly drawn, with motivation rooted in a specific, tragic backstory that earns the final sacrifice. The emotional connection to the puppet effectively grounds the abstract stakes, though the transition from observer to sacrifice relies slightly on rapid internal acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara is a fully realized focalizer whose internal conflict—hating the orchard yet faithfully serving its victims—drives the narrative. Her choice to destroy the nut (her mother's last gift) is a perfectly calibrated sacrifice that demonstrates her values under pressure. The emotional cost is embodied in action, not just reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose scientific worldview convincingly filters her grief. However, her emotional trajectory is somewhat idealized; the leap from insight to perfect execution lacks the internal friction or doubt that would make the resolution feel fully earned on a human level.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The vendor is a compelling, specific archetype whose motivation ("incise the day") drives the plot efficiently. The realization that she is the protagonist and the subsequent self-subtraction provide a decisive, high-cost choice that earns the fable-like resolution. While her internal life is more functional than deeply embodied, the clarity of her agency and the conceptual sacrifice fit the mode perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marisol is a vividly realized protagonist; her "chef" identity filters her perception of magic effectively ("bitter almonds," "sticky against the tongue"). Her motivation is clear, though the pivotal choice to "reverse" her gift feels slightly more like a mechanical problem-solving beat than a deeply agonizing character crucible, as the cost of giving up her own memories is glossed over in favor of the relief it brings.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mireya is a competent focalizer with a distinct role, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. Her attribute ("empathetically decisive") is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off, and she faces no genuine internal obstacle or doubt, resulting in a smooth but somewhat static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s "helix mind" is not just a label but a lens that colors every interaction, from the "screwdrivers turn left" to the seizure-like calibration. Her motivation is singular and deeply felt, driving her to risk her life for "data" that is actually human longing. The internal conflict between the chaotic tug of the memories and her need for engineering precision is brilliantly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ilyra is a competent, proactive protagonist whose specific skill set (prism-mindedness) drives the resolution. Her motivation is clear and urgent, though her internal landscape is defined more by professional duty than deep emotional contradiction or cost. The mention of a "whisper that tasted of iron and childhood" hints at depth that remains largely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilay’s competence is well-dramatized through her specific interaction with the statue, and the physical cost (trembling knees) at the end grounds the mythic tone. The explicit labeling of her craft as "empathy in motion" feels slightly expository, but her actions consistently support this trait.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for reflection rather than an active agent making hard choices in scene. His "struggle" is purely internal contemplation without contradictory impulses or on-page consequences. The emotion is frequently labeled ("anxious contemplation," "hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist feels constructed from prompt labels rather than psychological reality; "eclectic pacifist" is stated, not shown through complex behavior. Her motivation to "catalog silences" remains abstract and metaphorical, lacking a grounded, concrete want that creates friction. Emotional beats are performative ("theatrical sincerity") rather than embodied, and the epiphany arrives without internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is clear (ambition), but the internal pivot to gratitude feels unearned due to the lack of significant struggle or cost. The protagonist's competence resolves all issues easily, and the spectral interaction with the mother lacks dramatic friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Aera is a competent focalizer, but the emotional stakes of the climax are muted. She offers her memories "willingly" with no dramatized struggle or hesitation, making the sacrifice feel transactional rather than a costly, defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s competence anchors the surrealism; she treats the investigation with a believable mix of technical rigor and ritualistic care. The emotional subplot—conveyed entirely through the flight engineer’s patch—is efficient and poignant, culminating in a genuine release (the patch dissolving) that feels earned. Her choice to write backward is a distinct, character-specific adaptation to the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian is a distinct, mythic protagonist whose synesthesia is woven deeply into his agency and perception, not just appended as a trait. His motivation is clear, though the &quot;protective scales&quot; moment felt slightly rushed emotionally, treating a deep psychological stripping as a quick transactional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear, but her pivotal epiphany is delivered externally by a speaking reflection rather than earned through internal struggle or conflicting impulses. This didactic moment reduces her agency at the climax, as she simply nods and accepts the lesson instead of arriving at it through the pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quince’s arc from a borrower of souls to a self-determined "first edition" is compelling and complete. The internal cost of his choice—the "terrifying" weightlessness of his own heart—is vividly realized, fulfilling the "visible cost" requirement. The "widow" and "astronomer" personas function effectively as conflicting impulses that drive the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear surface traits ("jittery," "worn boots"), but his internal landscape is static. His transformation into "legend" feels like a surrender to destiny rather than a hard-won choice derived from his specific flaw; the "jittery" nature is a label that doesn't meaningfully complicate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s internal struggle is viscerally externalized through the ritual, moving from performative denial to a vulnerable admission of need. The emotional arc is distinct and earned, with the final renunciation of the prism demonstrating a clear shift in character state. The "mystic" persona is enacted through specific competence rather than just labels.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's choice to sacrifice her voice is anchored in visceral, embodied detail (swallowing the grit of the bead), earning the final stasis. The internal landscape of memory and loss is successfully externalized through the weaving and the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    Thistle is a thematic cipher with no conflicting desires or distinct personality beyond the "meek" label. His journey lacks a visceral, felt cost; the "confusion" he experiences is abstract and metaphysical rather than an embodied struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s arc from passive charter of loss to active agent of revelation is compelling, and the twist of her unwitting complicity adds excellent moral texture. However, the pivotal internal shifts rely occasionally on abstract labels ("precise ache of longing") rather than embodied reaction, and the mechanism of the note implies an amnesia/time-loop subplot that feels slightly underdeveloped for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a compelling protagonist whose reticence and internal depth mirror the isolated setting perfectly. The motivation—protecting the tower from forgetting rather than wreck—is distinct and poignant, driving the ritualistic plot. While his observant nature is generally dramatized well, the direct labeling of his eyes as "warmly observant" is a minor lapse in show-don't-tell.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael functions well as a mythic archetype suited to the fable mode, and her realization that her motivation is a geas adds necessary weight to her agency. While her interiority is stylized rather than deeply psychological, her choice to steer and accept the cost (dissolution) is earned by the established routine and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.6)
    Hoshiko functions primarily as a passive vessel for the heart's memories rather than an active protagonist. Her "realizations" are delivered to her by the magical object rather than earned through struggle or difficult choices. While her profession as a dye master integrates well with the climax, her interiority feels composed of abstract thematic statements rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose perspective effectively grounds the magical elements in the logic of "maintenance" work. While her agency is high and drives the ritual, the lack of contradictory internal impulses or hesitation makes her emotional trajectory feel somewhat linear and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency through a high-cost physical choice (smashing the mica into her chest) that resolves the internal conflict between scattering and coherence. The physical price paid creates a grounded, "felt" change in her state by the end. The characterization balances mythic archetype with visceral embodiment well.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal struggle with her mistake is compelling, but her transformation into the "guardian" feels like an ontological leap rather than a deeply felt psychological choice. The trait of "empathetic nerves" functions more as a magical sensor than a character flaw that complicates the decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mila acts as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character with distinct internal contradictions. While her motivation as a "noticer" drives the plot, her emotional arc feels somewhat emblematic, lacking deep friction or personal stakes beyond the thematic goal. The specific phrasing of her attribute ("heuristically gentle") feels forced and creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "gently meticulous" trait is not merely decorative but foundational to the protagonist's survival and methodology, driving her decision to measure rather than despair. The internal shift from preserving knowledge to "translating grief into data" is a sophisticated, character-specific realization that earns the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—betraying her father in hopes of being stopped—drives high-stakes agency with complex emotional layering. The shift from hope to resignation is embodied efficiently in physical details (the heartbeat against the horn, the fob digging into the palm), landing a poignant, character-specific closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is labeled a "skeptic," yet her actions—using a magical compass and accepting tree elections—contradict this trait, creating a fundamental disconnect between label and behavior. The internal conflict is stated ("fighting it") rather than dramatized, as she capitulates to the magical reality instantly without agency or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist possesses clear interiority and a defined backstory, but her agency is diluted at the climax. The emotional breakthrough is externalized through the magical animation of the lock ("numbers shifting of their own accord"), which solves the central puzzle for her rather than requiring her to actively unlock the trauma through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurelia’s physical reaction to lies (blistering) provides a sharp, embodied constraint that anchors her characterization effectively. However, Corin functions largely as a convenient mechanism to resolve the map puzzle; his arrival lacks distinct friction or independent agency, making the relationship dynamic feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist serves as an archetypal vessel for the allegory rather than a living person; her interiority is abstract ("overdosed her ears") rather than embodied. While the "mute quarter" constraint is consistent, the lack of internal friction or contradictory impulses limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    K-17 is a distinct focalizer with clear conflicting directives (order vs. nostalgia), but the resolution relies on a symbolic physical merger with the box rather than a dramatized psychological choice. The transformation into the seed feels more like a magical event than a character-driven decision, slightly distancing the closure from the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira is defined primarily by her thematic utility rather than internal contradiction. Her motivation ("prove that listening... is what finally heals") reads as a thesis statement rather than a visceral desire, flattening her agency into a vehicle for the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a competent vessel for the narrative's conceit but lacks the internal contradiction or psychological friction required for higher bands; she functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Miren is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear objective and a legible internal landscape. The transition from grief to "ballast" is earned, though the internal conflict lacks sharp contradictions; her journey is more procedural and emotional processing than a struggle between opposing urgent needs.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is a well-defined archetype whose internal state matches the external stakes. His motivation (redemption for his master) is clear, and the physical cost of his burden is palpably embodied in the final scene ("murmurs against the bone"), though the "cracked smile" trope feels slightly worn.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's shift from seeking knowledge to accepting the role of "keeper of lies" represents a profound internal turn earned by the scene's causality. The "agreed upon lies" concept provides a specific, poignant motivation for the relationship that embodies the loneliness rather than merely labeling it, satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s internal conflict is compelling, and the cost she pays (color vision) demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values. However, her transition from "charmed skeptic" to a believer performing a magical ritual is rapid and lacks on-page resistance, making the skepticism feel more like a label than a hurdle. Motivation is explicitly stated ("translate isolation into independence") rather than purely dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("wisely enduring," "calibrated treason") rather than dramatized internal struggle. The emotional arc feels summarized; Mara moves from vengeance to forgiveness instantly without a visible on-page crucible or contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The transition is intellectualized through memory rather than embodied in a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira's internal conflict (gift as curse) drives the narrative engine seamlessly. Her final choice to "sing the missing cadence" is a deeply earned character beat that resolves the central tension between stagnation and movement with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marrow functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character with internal agency or conflict; she accepts the quest without hesitation or contradictory impulse. The attribute "weaves truth carefully" is asserted as backstory and a qualification for the task, but she faces no on-page choice where this trait forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her interiority consists largely of abstract philosophical summaries ("mending was a conversation with water") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The reflection on "demure audacity" reads as a labeled trait rather than an earned state derived from pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marisol is a sharply drawn protagonist whose background as a debunker actively drives her methodology (using the shredded archive) and final choice. The moment of temptation—yearning for amnesia—provides necessary internal friction, though the resolution to "excavate truth" is swift; the closure is a decisive, character-specific act that weaponizes her findings.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is distinct and drives the narrative, particularly her willingness to become a "nightmare" to build a better reality. Her internal state is well-rendered, though the interiority occasionally leans on abstract summaries of her philosophy ("served no nation... only the ancient shadows") rather than dramatized experience. The emotional logic of her final sacrifice is coherent and earned by her prior isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    Posy functions as a lyrical archetype rather than a conflicted protagonist; her internal state is described through poetic abstraction ("bones humming") rather than contradictory impulses. While her motivation is clear, she faces no significant internal resistance or flaw that complicates the ritual, resulting in a portrait-like stasis rather than dramatic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mireya is a distinct, active protagonist whose engineering competence drives the plot. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("logically emotional calculus," "logically emotional—let tears fall") rather than purely dramatized contradiction, which distances the reader at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian is a competent professional with a distinct worldview, but his "impatience" reads more as a declared trait than a volatile flaw; his discipline never truly wavers, lowering the felt risk of the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority often lapses into diagnostic label-speak ("understood controlling influences") rather than embodied experience. The connection to her father relies on convenient summary rather than active, specific recollection.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Emil’s internal conflict—contrition versus passivity—is compelling and drives the narrative arc. However, his competence is undermined by the logic gap: if he possessed exonerating evidence ("map of doubts"), withholding it until the final hours to hand off to a music box repairer strains credibility. The emotional motivation is strong ("turn apology into action"), but the procedural logic of his choice weakens the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Juniper is a distinct, capable protagonist whose "irreverent awe" is well-dramatized through action and perception. The emotional arc is slightly dampened because the "yearning" is externalized into the machine, making her more of a dedicated executor than a conflicted agent, but her competence holds the narrative together.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is well-seeded through the subconscious "tattooing" of numbers, making the coincidence of finding her mother feel earned rather than random. The transition from corporate complicity to rebellion is clear, though the specific "brightly attentive" persona is told rather than dramatized in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s internal conflict is legible, but the climax relies on the convenient discovery of a crate explicitly labeled with her name and "surplus empathy." This externalizes the internal struggle via a lucky prop rather than a difficult character choice, reducing the weight of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a distinct, internalized protagonist with a clear emotional arc. However, the inciting transformation from euthanasia tourist to volunteer is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized, and her connection to the boy relies on a shared, abstract grief rather than specific interaction until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marco is distinct, but the interiority suffers from diagnostic labeling ("urge to nurture intersubjective understanding") that breaks the established lyrical voice. While the shift from resignation to hope is legible, it feels intellectually derived from the metaphor rather than viscerally earned through the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who executes a ritual without internal conflict or hesitation. While the "scar" suggests depth, it functions as backstory rather than a pressure point forcing a difficult choice in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions as a ritualistic vessel rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a personal cost to her actions. The descriptor "subtle puzzle archivist" feels like an inserted label rather than an integrated identity, and her emotional state is performed without vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a coherent focalizer, but her "reticence" is overcome with minimal struggle, reducing the emotional cost of her transformation. Her motivation to "decode the pattern" feels abstract and prompt-driven rather than visceral. The character relies on external cues (the crystal, the falling book) to drive action, resulting in a passive arc where she observes more than she decides.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's specific condition—precognitive memory loss—is dramatized effectively through the ritual of the chalk and driftwood, creating a unique internal landscape. Interiority is strong, balancing the philosophical weight of his task with visceral physical details like "joints creaking like old wood."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s agency in dismantling the station to capture the image is strong, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous ache," "counting possibilities") rather than embodied emotion. The mentor flashback feels convenient, but her final choice to "restructure herself" effectively lands the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a distinct, competent professional whose internal connection to the method (her father's vinyl) grounds her actions. Her competence is high, though the conflict remains largely external (managing the patient's transition) rather than forcing a deep internal crucible or difficult moral trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyra demonstrates clear agency and competence, driving the ritual to completion. However, she lacks internal contradiction or a moment of genuine hesitation; her sacrifice feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal struggle between her skeptic past and present belief is compelled by specific, grounded history (the bone-setting). However, her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract labeling ("cleft in certainty") rather than remaining strictly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira is a consistent focalizer with specific interiority ("exact mass of every night"). However, her competence is nearly absolute, handling the ritual without genuine struggle or internal contradiction, which lowers the dramatic tension. The emotional arc is smooth but lacks the grit of a difficult choice; the "cost" of the pearl feels more like a planned expenditure than a painful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is defined more by poetic descriptors ("watchful dreamer") than by difficult choices in the scene. Her primary antagonist is a memory; the on-page interaction with Elias is frictionless and lacks subtext or status negotiation. Elias serves as a convenient utility function rather than a distinct character, arriving solely to facilitate Mira's next move without generating interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a strongly realized protagonist whose internal conflict—artistic cowardice mirrored by her character's rebellion—drives the narrative. The realization that she must be rewritten rather than just collect "curios" creates a palpable, earned shift in her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a procedural vehicle for the ritual rather than a character with internal conflict. The descriptor "whimsical" contradicts her solemn, grieving behavior on the page, creating a disconnect between label and action. There are no significant micro-choices; she simply executes a pre-planned sequence without hesitation or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's specific vulnerability (flash-paper) is excellently physicalized, dictating his movement and breathing in every beat. His transition from seeker to guardian is motivated by a coherent internal logic of grief, though the emotional landscape leans slightly into romanticized archetypes rather than gritty contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    Ansel is a distinct, competent protagonist with clear agency. However, his internal conflict is minimal; the motivation to "store wonder" feels more like a stated tagline than a dramatized struggle, and his success comes without significant personal cost or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and the central conflict requires a high-stakes, character-specific sacrifice (the memory of the sister) that is well-dramatized. The reliance on "remembering the teaching" to prompt the climax slightly reduces the sense of organic agency, but the emotional cost of the confession is paid visibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s specific history (braiding manes, safety ropes) grounds her grief in tactile reality, creating a distinct and embodied character. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract summary ("harvest lessons from loss") rather than raw reaction, slightly distancing the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist and ghost possess distinct, clashing voices that drive the conflict effectively. The emotional logic of the negotiation feels authentic, and the "chronological contempt" of the ghost creates sharp relational pressure. Minor deduction for the self-diagnostic label ("chronologically confused") which tells rather than dramatizes the state initially, though the gait detail immediately grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") and interiority relies on poetic labeling ("silence honest") rather than grounded emotion. Alya encounters no genuine resistance, making her competence feel unearned and her character flat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Arlen’s internal arc is clear and the motivation—surrendering a failed dream—is poignant and legible. However, the emotional journey relies heavily on labeled states ("nostalgia," "condolences," "reverence") rather than dramatized friction in the moment. The transition from ambition to peace feels slightly unearned by on-page struggle, pivoting on a swift internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative arc from seeker to dismantler. The internal conflict is clear, though the interiority sometimes feels filtered through heavy metaphors ("creature newly born yet full of sediment") rather than visceral, embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ari’s motivation to preserve tradition is clear and drives action, but her characterization relies on repeated labels ("infinitely patient" appears three times) rather than varied embodiment. The description of eyes as "the color of winter kelp" is a stock cliché that detracts from the otherwise specific imagery. The dialogue "Heritage is a seed, not a glass case" feels like a thesis statement rather than natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc is coherent, but the climactic realization ("she was her own first client") feels like a convenient conceptual pivot rather than an emotionally earned turn. The character's feelings are often described through abstract labels ("terminal laughter," "merely heartsick") rather than embodied in specific, visceral reactions to the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prince functions effectively as a fable archetype, but interiority relies on performative labels ("sobbing," "regret") rather than complex micro-choices. Motivation is clear, but the emotional arc lacks gritty, embodied specificity beyond the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mara is a coherent focalizer, but her traits ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion") appear as inserted labels rather than dramatized behaviors. The internal conflict is resolved too easily ("breathed it down") without visible struggle or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara's defining traits ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") function as declared labels rather than drivers of action; she accepts the magical logic immediately without the friction a skeptic would provide. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("not grief but liberation") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires, resulting in a character who moves through the plot without genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and poignant, effectively driving the plot toward the beacon. However, his characterization relies heavily on the "otherworldly sentimentalist" label, and the "crack" in his heart feels more like a convenient metaphor than a visceral, embodied internal struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a passive vessel for the theme, receiving explanations from the grandmother rather than driving the discovery through struggle. The reliance on epithets like "the thoughtful gravestone carver" creates distance, and the internal state is described with labels ("fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—balancing the custodian’s duty against a brother’s memory—is dramatized through precise physical action rather than summary. The decision to modify the pendulum rather than destroy it reveals a complex, character-specific morality that seeks balance over chaos, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mercy is a distinct presence with a consistent "tender" worldview, but her transformation from blithe gardener to solemn keeper feels frictionless. The emotional reaction to the refugee revelation is muted, making the final acceptance of the "curse" feel more like a functional plot point than a deeply felt human choice.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's sacrifice is earned through a clear escalation of physical and metaphysical cost (frostbite, memory loss, dissolution). However, interiority often relies on diagnostic telling ("understood her motivation completely," "seed innovation within a constraint") rather than embodied desire, making the character feel more like a functional archetype than a living presence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mila is a compelling protagonist whose internal state—longing cloaked in silence—drives the narrative. Her choice to stay and transmit during the raid demonstrates clear agency and commitment to her goal. The characterization is consistent, though her stoicism borders on the archetypal, lacking a moment of faltering or raw doubt to ground the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is consistent and the internal state is vividly rendered, though the emotion often feels performed through high-concept metaphors rather than grounded in contradictory impulses. Elena's struggle remains largely retrospective; the on-page actions are ritualistic and inevitable, lacking a moment of active, difficult choice or hesitation that would deepen the character agency beyond the role of a griever.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist feels more like a thematic vehicle than a living person; traits like "rationally rebellious" are told via backstory labels rather than dramatized through choice. The explanation of immunity via "sewage-tasting micro-doses" clashes tonally with the atmospheric setting, reading as a jarring pseudo-scientific insertion in a mythic context.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s renunciation of her singing voice provides a tangible cost that elevates the character arc above a simple magical fix. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels ("unlearn hatred," "frequencies anger forgets") rather than visceral, embodied emotion, making the "rage" she suppresses feel distant rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marisol is a competent archetype rather than a conflicted individual; her interiority is rich with metaphor but lacks the contradictory impulses or doubts that create depth. She faces no internal hurdles, and her victory is achieved without a character-specific psychological cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s constraint (involuntary truthfulness) is woven seamlessly into the world and serves as the pivot for the climax. Her motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives the shift from routine to rebellion. The choice to lie carries significant weight because her nature is established early as a tangible restriction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype (the mystical healer) rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict or blind spots. She encounters no genuine resistance, makes no mistakes, and pays no personal price, resulting in a flat trajectory despite the atmospheric interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—between the programming of a sentinel and the awakened desire for truth—is palpably dramatized. The final choice to break the ampoule is a decisive renunciation of their original purpose, earned by the sensory processing of the garden's history, with a felt cost of destroying a unique artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal transition from mathematical rigidity to visceral intuition is dramatized effectively through the blood-sigma action. The refusal of the hand at step -1 acts as a profound moment of agency, rejecting the comfort of the past for a decisive, destructive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's agency dissolves at the climax when "her wrist moved without her," reducing her to a passive vessel for magic. While motivation is stated ("methodically hopeful"), Mira faces no conflicting desires or hard trade-offs that would deepen characterization beyond the archetype of the weary artist.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurelia's motivation is clear, but her internal life is often delivered via diagnostic labels ("historically oriented mind," "cultured composure") rather than embodied reaction. The pivotal emotional shift is summarized in a single realization rather than dramatized through a struggle with genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s arc from dread to acceptance is structurally sound, and the cost paid (loss of his singular gift) provides a defined psychological shift. However, interiority relies heavily on repeated labeling ("bleak exhilaration") rather than fresh, embodied nuance in each beat, which flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape of trauma is vivid, and the refusal of the advisor's urge to "speak" demonstrates agency. However, the "whispering advisor" feels like a standard literary device for internal monologue rather than a fully realized character or distinct external force, limiting the relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prophet is a distinct archetype whose worldview drives every beat, transforming the crisis through specific, character-driven agency. While internal conflict is minimal (fitting the fable mode), his shift from striking objects to striking absence represents a decisive, high-stakes adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, specifically in the choice to "crack" the note, which drives the climax. Interiority is clear and linked to the mother's legacy, though the repeated use of the tag "quietly driven" feels like a label rather than fully embodied nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation to "rescue truth" is compelling and drives the scene’s central action. However, the prompt attribute "emotionally rational" is applied as a static label ("emotionally rational eyes") rather than fully dramatized, which flattens the interiority slightly during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation to archive grief in mortar is compelling, but her interiority relies on slightly melodramatic tropes (the "waltzes" note feels generic). The explicit labeling of her as "stoically sensitive" and the performative wince at the gull cry weaken the "show, don't tell" impact of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a focused, competent protagonist whose internal conflict between her role (indexer) and her curiosity (finding the "honest origins") drives the narrative. Her shift from functionary to subversive historian is earned through specific on-page actions and realizations. The motivation is palpable and creates clear agency.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is masterfully integrated with the protagonist's trade; her perception is filtered through the lens of a lantern maker ("never wastes fuel," "soldering copper"). The internal motivation—transforming grief before it hardens—is viscerally embodied in the physical ritual. The emotional arc is precise and deeply felt without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's arc from grief-stricken scavenger to sacrificial agent is compelling and deeply felt. The emotional logic holds the high-concept premise together, with the shift in motivation earned through specific, on-page realizations and a tangible sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("belonging," "frequencies") rather than embodied emotion or difficult choices. The protagonist faces no internal resistance or contradictory impulses; she simply seeks, finds, and accepts. The antagonist (Pilgrim) is defined solely by a repetitive tag ("perpetually surprised") rather than distinct behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a compelling figure with a distinct, guilt-ridden profession, but his backstory suffers from significant timeline contradictions (being taught by a grandfather who abandoned the family 60 years ago). The mother's motivation—buying a lie to give him permission to stop lying—is psychologically intricate but strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael is a distinct, cohesive focalizer with a consistent worldview ("trafficked in futures"). The internal weight of his brother's death adds necessary gravity. Seris acts as a partner in the ritual rather than a prop, though the "guards lowering spears" reaction feels like an unearned convenience rather than a character-driven shift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The character functions as a vessel for poetic conceits rather than a person with grounded agency. Interiority relies on abstract aphorisms ("pain is just another form of percussion") instead of embodied emotion, and the shift from regret to resolution feels asserted by the narrator rather than earned through character choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's trajectory from a hollow "clean slate" to a "reusable" vessel of guilt is compelling and clearly motivated. The internal conflict drives the plot, though the emotional articulation leans heavily on high-concept metaphor ("nausea," "consent to fracture") rather than grounded, visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation—reclaiming the sister—is visceral and drives every beat. The transition from individual to collective identity ("we") is earned through the established bond, though the explicit naming of the "paradoxically steady" trait feels slightly mechanical compared to the otherwise demonstrated resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her agency dissolves at the climax where magical intervention ("the saucer crack detached... and struck her") replaces internal choice. The emotional arc leaps from grief to "laughing and weeping" without a dramatized psychological process or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradictions or distinct impulses that would create genuine friction. The attribute "gravitationally lighter" is charming but operates more as magical physics than a psychological trait driving difficult choices. The resolution feels earned by definition rather than by a dramatized struggle against a viable alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.6)
    Kael functions as a thematic vessel rather than a believable protagonist; his motivation is abstract ("guide him back to purpose") and lacks grounded internal contradiction. The dialogue with Lira is purely symbolic, devoid of naturalism, serving only to articulate the theme rather than reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Garnet demonstrates clear agency, particularly in the deception of Commander Voss. However, her interiority relies heavily on the repeated metaphor of the "cradle of sparks" rather than varied emotional texture. The antagonist, Voss, functions as a convenient plot device who is easily manipulated, lowering the complexity of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but the "precognitive curse" renders him largely passive; he acts as a witness to a script he cannot change rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. The emotional connection to Mira provides motivation but feels utilitarian, serving the plot rather than generating raw, embodied grief in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is deeply realized, with the tension between her erased voice and the "government-issued" constraints driving every micro-choice. The cost of her rebellion is felt in the physical details of the mask and the dissolve of her manuscript, culminating in a coherent, earned transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on archetypes ("dueling philosopher") and stated history rather than dramatized friction. While Elian's interiority is accessible, his shift from rival to collaborator feels frictionless; Vale surrenders the clue immediately, removing the potential for a difficult character-defining choice or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lark is a compelling, specific protagonist; the physical molting effectively externalizes his internal struggle with entropy. The relationship with Marin is drawn with economy, showing a shared history through action rather than just exposition. The choice to reframe their resistance as "educational credit" reveals his cunning under pressure, though the poetic register of their dialogue occasionally threatens to merge their voices into a single authorial sound.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The pianist's internal struggle—waiting as performance versus living—is beautifully externalized through action. Her agency drives every beat, from climbing the shaft to the final rejection of the loop, and the emotional cost of "Onward" is felt deeply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Motivation and agency are exemplary; the protagonist’s choice to sacrifice a specific, cherished memory to save the community creates a resonant, felt cost on the page. The internal conflict between duty and self-preservation is dramatized effectively, ensuring the final renunciation feels earned rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (relieve the "ache"), but the protagonist’s internal landscape relies heavily on abstract labels ("cerulean regret") rather than embodied struggle. The character functions primarily as a vessel for the ritual, following instructions without high-stakes agency or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena's motivation to process grief through art is rooted in particular traits like charcoal fingers and woven lies, with embodied contradiction in positioning the chair as "comfort, then as absence." Internal conflict emerges via fragmented stories tilting present choices, earning final endurance of absence. Minor slip: epiphanic summaries slightly outweigh simultaneous impulses acting in the scattering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Caldera's rationally rebellious trait drives concrete micro-choices like sewage micro-dosing and femur-stylus creation, with contradictory impulses (private agony vs. public prophecy) acting in the sump-writing beat; final speech earns change via prior causality, foreclosing isolation with crowd recoil cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol's motivation shines in tasting glass to map failures, rooting rebellion in chef-specific sensory interiority; micro-choices like feeding blood reveal resolve with self-knowledge cost. Minor slip in abstract "synaptic plasticity" label without full embodied contradiction, but final laugh grounds it. Earned endurance against Ministry forecloses safe paths.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's truthful curse creates embodied contradiction, peaking when she whispers the lie to spark lightning, earning her change with job-risk cost. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in ascent and summit choice. Boy applies brief crucible pressure without diluting her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied noticing of "porches leaning one degree closer to the sea"; contradictory impulses in collecting trifles yet leaving absences unfilled earn the final renunciation. Mission refines through pressure without tidy epiphany. Flawless under single-POV defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses peak at the arch ("revelation is not a hammer; it is a dialogue"), compelling the gentle breakage with embodied cost in softening stone skin; interiority particular to mineral awakening avoids epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's grim optimism drives micro-choices like prime-leap counting and blood-smearing, earning the closure renunciation; contradictory climb-panic impulses act in the faltering-staircase beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's interiority shines in embodied details like "insomnia now a lantern," with micro-choices (setting mirror, sprinkling turmeric) revealing methodical hope under fatigue pressure. Final fatigue-to-blanket change earned via sustained painting. Minor slip: emotions poetic but occasionally abstract, lacking deeper contradiction in peak glyph-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aurelia's arc from cataloguer to participant peaks in shaping "H" for home, earned by contradictory impulses of preservation vs. immersion shown in her cracked composure and micro-choices like photographing loaves for portable archives.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "bleak exhilaration" layering dread with thrill during yoyo tricks; final renunciation of gift earned by causal buildup of reversed gears and stone's cost. Micro-choices like winding string backward reveal values under pressure. No unearned epiphanies; embodied dread pulses concretely via stone.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority concrete and embodied (words "clog like sawdust," clutching clasp for heat); contradictory impulses act in pinning photo over speaking; final forgiveness earned via prior micro-choices under advisor's urging, with cost of advisor's silence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prophet's motivation to convert obstacles into instruments drives consistent micro-choices like striking absence, earning the final hearing; embodied via mallet swings and cloud readings. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, but competence with struggle balances it. Final endurance of silence into groove feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist's quietly driven obsession shown through persistent piping amid dread and screams, with embodied pulse hammering and contradictory sunwashed dread; final whistle drop earns renunciation with visible cost, rooted in mother's log.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses act vividly in the seductive pull of the letter's beauty versus truth-rescue drive, earning the final shedding of family glory; embodied stress in heartbeat and memories anchors interiority without diagnostic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stoically sensitive trait embodied in wince at gull and palm against inscribed stone, compelling higher-stakes direct inscription at dome; final endurance of sealing personal confession earned via prior note rituals with felt cost in lighter inkwell.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (catalogue indexing her) act in scene via hypotheses and micro-choices like extinguishing lantern; final renunciation of false taxonomy earned by escalating discoveries with personal cost of "private pressure."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional embodied grief and micro-choices, like inhaling the leaking dream until ribs glow, reveal contradictory impulses of holding/releasing with earned final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael's motivation rooted in brother's death and moon-syncing compels thoughtful micro-choices like gloves and lullaby, earning change with felt cost in heavier heart. Guards and Seris apply pressure via named fears, revealing flaws without stereotypes. Minor slip: internal conflict more harmonious than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction embodied in choosing pole lights over charts despite shoals; final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like reciting mantra amid wake. Contradictory impulses act in scene with laugh-sob-toast revealing flawed competence. 9+ test met: hierarchy of values in ignoring "paper apologies."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses peak at lake bargain ("wade in and absorb every pain... or retreat"), compelling earned immersion with embodied nausea and guilt as visible cost; interiority particular via trembling hand signing lives away.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses act vividly in fighting skin's glow to stay flesh for ritual ("ribs brightening like lanterns, but I fought the change"), earning the merger choice with relational cost; shadow's warning adds crucible pressure. Interiority particular via tastes/memories; no labels dilute embodiment. Final renunciation of separate forms seals arc holistically.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority through embodied grief, like "throat filled with choking beauty," reveals contradictory impulses of seeking and perplexity; final change earned as time floods lungs, foreclosing denial with laugh/wept cost. Flawless under single-POV pressure; voice-particular traits drive micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sister Halcyon's pacifist traits compel stitching despite holograms' warnings ("The door you open may not be mercy"), earning her fusion of sorrow/joy and eternal stay as visible cost in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael's motivation as destitute philanthropist intensifies credibly through embodied actions like uncorking bugs and submerging arms, earning a change from purposelessness to tactile prophecy. Lira applies secondary pressure via her question, forcing reply amid quake. Minor slip: mosaic face epiphany leans abstract without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Garnet's motivation roots deeply in the "cradle of sparks," driving micro-choices like deceiving Voss with a false surge; contradictory obedience vs. rebellion acts simultaneously in that beat. Final unmasking earns change through prior risks. No unearned epiphanies; embodied in heart-drumming tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's precognitive curse concretely constrains his rock placements, revealing helpless witnessing as a core flaw that earns the momentary lift. Interiority ties embodied actions (barefoot on slick rocks) to Mira's promise without stock epiphanies. Final touch of dissolving eel forecloses the "understand" path with felt conceptual cost, showing hierarchy of surrender over control.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses embodied in silent recitation amid storm risk and final alignment choice earned by scar-cloud mapping; no unearned epiphanies, traits constrain upward dissolution over printers.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses shine in Elian's lunge then instant understanding from the paper slip, earning the collaborative turn with relational cost of rivalry foreclosed; mechanical arm embodies traits without labels.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lark's embodied molt ("new skin still trembles") and micro-choices (showing tin, bluffing Rourke) earn final change to "co-conspirator"; distinct voices in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses (eternal waiting vs. forward motion) act vividly in the film-loop realization and final chord, earning the exit choice with the cost of forsaking "maybes"; interiority particular via clock-winding ritual and embodied "steely longing."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hesitation at fissure—"feeling the empirically whimsical tug between duty and self"—embodies contradictory impulses with earned choice to plant seed, costing teacher's name and laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is never named, only refracted through the butterfly dust and the silent greenhouse. The moment she laughs “more exhale than emotion” crystallizes her arc: from frantic escape to still witness. Cost is legible—she leaves the wing fragment looking “like any other bit of trash,” renouncing her need for cosmic drama. Minor deduction: the “neutron star researcher” tag feels label-only until the synchrotron appears.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The luminous glass artist is a singular, fully embodied presence whose contradictory impulses—hunger for justice versus hunger for quiet—are alive in every beat; her micro-choices (crushing the ledger, trading the obsidian, gathering her beads) visibly foreclose the smugglers’ path and her old identity. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic: “charcoal… blistering her lips,” “glass fragments ignited into floating sparks.” The final renunciation (opening a studio for dawn vigils rather than profit) carries clear, scaled cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s survivor-guilt and compulsion to “translate” are embodied through tactile micro-choices (striking forks, calibrating colors) that visibly cost her body heat and scanner battery. The final renunciation—leaving the frozen symphony behind—earns its sting because every prior fork-strike has literalized her grief. Interiority stays specific and sensorial; no label-speak intrudes at peak beats. The only bar to 9+ is that the emotional arc is almost too seamless—her flaws illuminate but never truly complicate the closing gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The undertaker’s interior contradiction—his fear of the coast vs. the shard’s “unpaid debt” tug—is dramatized in one micro-choice: he descends the ladder. Stubbornness is shown, not labeled, and the final acceptance of tenure carries a visible cost: his own name in the ledger. The lens-hotter-when-facing-northeast trick gives a tactile, character-specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her coat-pocket awareness of the muffled bell, the cart’s false-bottom weight, the pebble ritual—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction flickers only once (hope vs exile fatalism) and is embodied, not labeled. The final silent lift of the bell crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost; no path is reset, no slogans intrude. Voice stays individual, never drifts into committee exile-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pilgrim’s interior contradictions—between hoarded grief and the urge to gift—are alive in breath-to-breath micro-choices; the soldier-memory and jade transfer are embodied, not labeled. The man’s wrong-buttoned coat and rattling lungs give credible physical shorthand for his flaw. Both surrender the bead, a renunciation that forecloses the safety of private ache and is earned by the shared breathing sequence. Minor slip: “pilgrim of sparks” remains more epithet than lived identity, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—sap on palms, salt of future tears—yet never drifts into label-speak. The refusal to cross the door crystallizes a hierarchy of values: witness over escape, cost felt in bark replacing veins. Contradictory impulses (remember vs. let go) torque every beat; final renunciation is earned by the prior vision of herself as ghost-memory. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Her interiority is vivid—“patient as drought-grass” breathing through rusted manacles—but the endurance/renunciation closure is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; we are told “liberation is only the first prize” instead of feeling the forfeiture. The strategic patience trait is shown in the piano-bench decoding and the waltz that nets the guards, yet the final scattering of seeds reads as symbolic coda rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene; she moves from captivity to savior with unbroken competence, flattening internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—collecting absences while denying her own complicity—drives every beat; the final press of ear to iron crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The brother remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible tests are waived; her micro-choices under keeper pressure suffice. One hairline slip: “chosen doubt over belief” is articulated rather than embodied just before the forge beat, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thief’s curiosity motive is vivid and consistent; the micro-choice to return the woman’s own face instead of cutting another is earned by the ring-inscription beat. Interiority is floral-cipher poetic but remains character-specific. The absence of any visible cost to the thief (fatigue, moral scar, lost tool) keeps the renunciation from feeling fully priced at this length. Still, contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. erasure) act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test for contradictory impulses with earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—grief’s paralysis versus the need to thaw—remains embodied in every micro-choice (rubbing the bookmark, narrating to steady her hands). The decision to leave the dome behind crystallizes her shift from escapist maker to caretaker of shared space; cost is visible in the relinquishment. No diagnostic clichés; her flaws complicate the act. Single POV keeps pressure tight.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s interior contradiction—professional daredevil who flinches at his own shadow—remains vivid and embodied throughout; every beat of the flashlight tremor or knee-knock is a stunt cue. The shell whisper re-weights his self-concept with a felt cost: tomorrow he will leak the trembling take and risk career erasure. Micro-choices (rotating the child’s cast, aiming the projector at the perforated roof) crystallize a hierarchy that puts truth above safety. The only drag is one late “vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source” line that edges toward thesis-speak, slightly blunting the prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    The oracle’s interiority is sensorially rich—bare toes gripping salt-slick stone, pulse syncing with a dying star—yet her obsession with “cartographing oblivion” stays abstract, never concretely clashes with another desire. Micro-choices (writing faster as the star dims, accepting mineral patience) embody the mild obsession, but the final self-immolation into map lacks a prior beat that forecloses any alternative path; cost is atmospheric, not character-bound. Still, the voice is singular and the flaw drives every beat; the absence of a second character or status crucible is scope-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    J4N-17’s growing obsession with the violin and with the origin of thought is dramatized through repeated, increasingly purposeful micro-choices (touching, then playing). The moment of “cold burning” in loop 193 gives embodied cost to its rising interiority. The final renunciation—accepting infinite loops as the price of consciousness—earns its stoic calm. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the composite memory could be even more granular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on warm ink, ear to the wall—and her refusal to confront Rico/Jun dramatizes a genuine, costly renunciation. The “open lock” doodle crystallizes her stance, but the moment of letting-go is slightly under-dramatized; we see the symbol, not the internal tremor. Still, her contradictory impulses (accuse vs. absolve) coexist in the same beats, earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her withered hands, the clink of marbles, the taste of every season in the apple—yet her contradictory impulse (garden’s servant vs. claimed mastery) is stated more than enacted. The final renunciation of control is earned by forty years of ritual shown in evocative fragments, but the moment of cost is slightly abstract; the glove’s perfect fit is symbolically potent yet feels providential rather than paid for in flesh. Still, her values hierarchy is legible: marbles over wrist-score, garden over self, broken beauty over measurable luck. A hairline slip from 9: the decisive internal shift lacks a visible bodily price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mechanic’s interiority is textured—prosthetic lungs, twilight walks, the tactile pulse of the cobalt sphere—and her contradictory wish to undo the very bargain that keeps her alive complicates every beat. Micro-choices (centering the lever instead of yanking it, recording nothing) reveal a hierarchy where survival is traded for agency. The refusal to file a report is a credible, on-page renunciation that costs her certainty and keeps the chrysalis image alive. What keeps this from 8.8+ is that the younger-self hesitation is observed rather than re-lived; we’re told the ripple reaches her muscles but we don’t feel the tug in her body at that instant.</question>
    <question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: by leaving the lever centered she forecloses retroactive escape and accepts perpetual twilight, a felt cost registered in the “slightly offset” footstep. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the nexus–moth-bat interference pattern is the tightening that reweights choice. Orientation is secured early: station above violet cloud-sea, axial spine, aviary module. The only drag is the leap from “pattern recognition” to “sideways exit”; the holographic mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated in a beat we can track.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting: it constrains every move—she must touch it, match its pulse, decide around it—and the final image of sphere-against-ghost charges the closing beat. Violet cloud-sea, half-light corridors, titanium aviary ribs are sensuously evoked yet filtered through her technician’s selective attention. Spatial choreography is clean: palm to sphere, lever recess, moth-bats lifting in slow motion. One minor slip: “icy warmth” is used twice in close succession; the reprise feels accidental rather than re-weighted.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time vs. keep biological lungs—does tighten when the 3:5 interference pattern offers a live chance to rewrite her own consent. Escalation is accumulative: ghost corridors bloom, futures fan, cost becomes visible. Agency is present yet gentle; she steps back into twilight rather than forcing the fold, a credible technician’s caution. The price (perpetual mechanical breath) is felt, but because the alternate futures are glimpsed in telescopic summary rather than dramatized beats, the tightening lacks a visceral pinch point.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges as the equation between mechanical survival and unfinished becoming; the station-as-chrysalis image is particular, not asserted. The final image—offset footstep—answers the thematic question without moralizing: sideways time is lived, not proven. Subtext in the moth-bat hum and the lattice of frost is evocative, though “subdued awakenings” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak. Insight is earned through sensory confrontation rather than exposition, giving the piece a haunting after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musician’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his feeling “trapped between spaces” drives every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses (stay invisible vs. claim voice) coexist in-scene, culminating in the earned decision to play the unsung symphony. The ghost’s pressure functions as externalized status antagonist, forcing his value hierarchy into view. Cost is visible: he surfaces at dawn physically soaked and artistically unmoored from former repertoire.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle’s interiority is richly embodied—“rootlet pierce her diaphragm,” “stone rose into her throat”—and her micro-choices (sketching leaves, kneeling to smudge) externalize the internal stake. Contradictory impulses (protect the valley vs. evacuate truth) coexist in scene, and the final renunciation costs her 4.7 g of sorrow, earned by prior causality. No relationship crucible is on-page, and the swallowed seed’s weight is accepted rather than battled, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific skepticism colliding with the metaphysical weight she insists on measuring—remains concrete and embodied; her hand on the rail, the tilt of the brass cap, each micro-choice manifests the exact hierarchy between curiosity and guilt. The swallowed truth becoming “brass—recorded, balanced, and, for the first time, bearable” crystallizes earned renunciation with visible cost (leaving the wheel spinning forecloses re-investigation). No diagnostic self-help labels intrude; even her brother’s confession is filtered through tactile memory rather than moral summation. Character voice stays idiosyncratic and singular—no committee voice or averaged lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s interiority is lyrically concrete—“regenerative silence pool beneath the stone like breath held too long” embodies her creed. The single contradiction—once trying to save a chronicle, watching it bleed into saplings—drives her lifetime renunciation; the cost is felt when she steps onto the mirror-water and becomes the next fold. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The final renunciation is earned; memory flattening into library roots visibly costs her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but thin on contradictory impulse; her only micro-choice is to press the curl to steady the whistle, a beat that is embodied and stakes-bearing. The “softly adaptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized—no moment shows her adjusting tactics under failure. Yet the memory-anchored gesture and the felt cost of fading wonder keep her above stock; she earns a quiet endurance that forecloses retreat, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The historian’s solitary, almost mystical vocation is rendered through tactile, embodied beats—pressing palm to concrete, ear to tapestry—that externalize her inner contradiction: she hoards stories yet must surrender her last solitude to complete one. Her micro-choices (placing the fragment thread-side to concrete, climbing the spiral again) tighten the stakes and foreclose the path of mere collection; the final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak; the “bronze quiet” becomes her new axis. Voice remains singular and mythic rather than diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Chen’s contradictory impulses—spy habit vs. lyrical escape—are alive in every micro-choice (palming film, hollowing bolt, whispering lyrics). The final renunciation costs his identity and safety, foreclosed by prior beats. Keeper remains functional foil; no headcount harm. Interiority avoids label-speak; embodiment strong (“pulse syncing with the turning beam”).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    The priest’s interior contradiction—needing certainty to bait the demon yet starving it with doubt—remains abstract; “the need to be possessed” is asserted, not dramatized in body or micro-choice. His final self-immolation into the loop is credible and costly, but the emotional texture is filtered through lyric paraphrase rather than moment-by-moment beats that body the stakes. Still, the arc of renunciation is coherent and the sacrifice anchors closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s ache is palpable, but her decisions are more impulse than dialectic; we watch memories flash but see no contradictory drives collide in real time. The final renunciation lands as lyrical assertion (“the map she had drawn was the home she missed”) rather than as a choice paid for on the page. Interiority is vivid yet curiously diagnostic (“chronologically homesick”)—a label that short-circuits embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are present (etching, kneeling, raising hands) but they don’t narrow or foreclose live options; the cost is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for self-unity while weaponizing the tablet that spawns more selves—are dramatized in embodied beats (the temporal papercuts, the backward-running scream). The final smash is earned because every previous step widened the fracture between versions; the cost is the erasure of all but one unchosen moment. Minor: the “labyrinth of self” tag feels abstract once, but the image of seventeen arches each naming the same sin immediately re-embodies it.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s contradictory need to “hear” silence through vibration is embodied in every tactile choice; the filing of the needle and the palm-to-drum beat dramatize her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—yet the sister-grief motive is front-loaded in a reflective block that slightly flattens early pressure. The final renunciation (lifting the needle, choosing forward drumbeats) is earned by the preceding backward spin and is individuated to her deaf sensorium. Relationship crucible with Temen is present but thin—his single signed prompts are more facilitator than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized in the immediate kneel-and-wait beat; her refusal to seed falsified data is a credible renunciation that costs her the surface life we glimpse in the opening. The contradiction between professional precision and outlaw loyalty is held in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “integrity flared like a lantern in wind” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, trimming the top.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elian’s grief is a living contradiction—he both clings to and diffuses Lira’s scent—embodied in every micro-choice from the cautious inhale to the vial buried like a seed. The internal clash between broker habit and bereaved lover drives each beat; the final renunciation of selling lanterns tomorrow crystallizes a visible cost. No stock interiority; every thought is filtered through olfactory memory and the synesthetic glow of ultraviolet flora. Flaws (broker detachment vs. raw need) actively complicate tactics and foreclose the old life.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s interiority is textured—ink-stained fingers, the rope’s heat in his palms, the tug between transcendence and witness. Contradictory impulses (join the light vs. stay fleshy) stay alive in scene, not summary. The final act—walking out still corporeal, rope as belt—pays off prior causality and carries visible cost (he forecloses effortless eternity). No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; head-count stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority—her acoustical parsing of drips as minor sevenths, her refusal to finish phrases—gives a sharp, embodied through-line. The bowl-as-resonator beat crystallizes her heritage and present aim in one micro-choice. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene, so the internal-conflict bullet is only partially met, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—dealer who never samples yet now risks her own product—drives every beat; her embodied collapse into “porous, aching affection” is earned by the slow thaw staged through scent, static, and kneeling. The micro-choice to press the petal to the lie-spot of her pulse crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No stock therapy-speak; even “insight without empathy was just surveillance” grows from her lived metaphor of bottled lightning bugs. Flaw remains active: her earlier detachment is the very coat she folds beside her, a visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s quiet waivers and the locket ritual reveal a credibly conflicted broker whose compassion is both habit and hazard; the ledger-as-tide belief seeds the final hand-off without overt self-congratulation. Interiority stays concrete (“salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings”) and her micro-choice to surrender the locket carries visible cost. Only the elder nephew rescue coincidence nicks credibility, slightly softening the arc of earned mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority stays rooted in peat-sap scent and calloused fingers; the moment her lungs “feel sewn shut” is embodied, not labelled. The final gesture—palms to ground, exhaling a heron-cradling-reed glyph—earns her belonging turn through prior tag-tracking and mercury-net epiphany. One flaw: the “boldly sympathetic ache” is named, not dramatized, a hairline telegraph that keeps her just off 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s desire to recover her mother’s last, unfinished syllable powers every step; the infinity pendant and cadenced breathing make her choices tactile. Interior contradiction—yearning vs. the price of un-lived minutes—stays embodied in footfalls and warming silver, not labels. Final surrender of future time feels proportionate and inevitable, earning resonant stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich—braiding fog, reciting primes—yet the emotional arc is compressed into a single lyrical ascent; the “ambiguous loss” is stated more than dramatized in micro-choice, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s hoarding of voices is a vivid, embodied obsession; every crawl-axis motion is freighted with micro-choices (where to slide the next reel, which knothole to breathe through). The contradictory pull—secrecy vs. the need to be heard—peaks when he pushes his own tape under the floor so the girl can “see” him; the cost (permanent exposure, eviction from ghost-status) is felt in the hush before the lights return. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “stories are lanterns” is delivered as a recorded artifact, not authorial sermon. The only flaw: the girl’s interiority is ventriloquised through Elias’s perception, so the relationship crucible is one-sided, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the trellis, the burn scar, the laugh of hollow bamboo—yet the metamorphosis leap is asserted more than earned. Her scientific precision is well-established, but the moment she “releases her grip on understanding” is narrated rather than dramatized, so the final surrender feels slightly abstract. Still, the contradiction between control and surrender is consistently held, and the cost is visible in her rooted legs and slowed heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s insomnia is embodied in raw eyes and paint-stained choices; the grandmother’s brooch becomes a tactile obsession that warms under pressure. Contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while mocking her own failure—stay active in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of insomnia as gift is earned through causal interaction with the tidal ruins and the old woman’s recognition. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: paint what the water revealed → accept vial → sleep, each step priced with forfeiture of old certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pilgrim’s interiority is richly textured—his sensory memory of rain-on-asphalt becomes the crucible for the magic transfer—yet his own pre-transfer motives remain slightly abstract, preventing a 9-band. The seer’s resignation is embodied in her obsidian-bright smile, a micro-choice that forecloses her escape; the resulting luminescent scar on him is a visible, irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’squiet, inverse heroism—collecting absence instead of treasure—remains consistent and particular; his interiority is lyric yet grounded in embodied detail (salt-crusted coat, valve warming like skin). The final renunciation of “empty satchel” for an echo-archive is earned through a chain of micro-choices and pays visible emotional cost. Secondary figures (janitor, woman) supply immediate pressure without crowding the frame. No interior contradiction is dramatized in-scene; the flaw is implied rather than tested under stress, capping fractionally below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Alden’s interior contradiction—precision vs. painting—drives every beat; the punch-as-stylus reifies it. Emotions stay embodied (ultramarine on chest). The final renunciation is earned: each punched confession lights a carriage compartment, foreclosing silence. Only lapse: the “trembling certainty” refrain edges diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s skeptical reflex is continuously embodied—touching seams she “refused to believe were magic,” staggering when memories flood, choosing to listen rather than refute. The interior contradiction (grief solved by reason vs. participatory surrender) drives every micro-choice; her final act of loosening borders is earned through the night of felt pressure. Cost is visible: the notebook that once promised proof now carries an “unheard symphony,” a literal foreclosed path. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak; only nit: we get no sensory trace of her body under extreme surge—heartbeat, sweat—so embodiment peaks at 8.4 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vey’s centuries-bored immortal is vivid through perceptual signature—sandcastle civilizations, “iron boredom in his blood.” Interior contradiction peaks when the fragment’s magnetic hunger hooks that very ennui, forcing the choice to step through darkness. The renunciation is earned: surrender of timelessness for unmarked silence, cost legible in the final “hollows of his formerly infinite heart.” Only slight waiver: the technicians’ collective pressure stays sketchy; their mutiny more premise than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cassidy’s hierarchy of values—mother’s name > father’s myth > her own memory—emerges through embodied micro-choices (pacing, uncapping the pot, blowing on ink). The final forfeiture of the lullaby is a palpable, irreversible cost that retroactively justifies every prior beat. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no diagnostic shorthand. Only hairline gap: the “mathematics” metaphor is voiced twice but never tested in scene, a micro-telegraph that slightly undercuts the interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aurelia’s interiority—her need to “collect textures of different times” and her fear of “exhaust[ing] the world’s longing”—is concrete and embodied; the lamp’s vibration traveling “through her wrist bones” shows embodied emotion under pressure. The final renunciation—launching the forgery as ash that fertilizes real trees—pays the prior causality with visible cost: her notepad is “lighter by one forgery, heart heavier by one truth.” The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-epiphany (“she understood the silence was not absence but fullness”), a hairline slip that keeps this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“lungs counting the cadence of brine and machinery,” “label burn cold against her thigh”—and her micro-choice to invert the poison’s purpose by planting memory-scraps is credibly driven by accumulated pressure. The contradiction between official erasure and sensory aliveness stays active in scene, not summary. Cost is felt when she feeds her death certificate to the tide, renouncing reclaimed identity to remain nameless. Flaws: the dying captain’s exposition is slightly diagnostic, and the barcode wrist detail drifts in then vanishes without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlen’s contradictory drives—rational debunker vs. ache for wonder—are viscerally embodied in the bow-stroke that drinks his heartbeat. Each retold voice tightens the stake: measurement becomes mystery, pride becomes sob. The final renunciation (leaving the cello porous) costs him proof and lets the voices forgive him—an earned stasis that forecloses his old crusade. Interiority never abstracts; even “gloomy cheerfulness” is salt-sprayed and sternum-felt.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s interior contradiction—wanting the city unchanged yet fearing its erasure—drives every graffiti stroke and midnight speech; the stone chip’s final swing against her chest tolls the cost of that split. Emotion stays embodied (thumping necklace, candy-for-stories barter) rather than diagnosed. The renunciation of the chip’s talismanic certainty is earned: she has rehearsed losing the city all night. Only the Syndicate negotiators remain silhouettes, but they are plot functions, not crucible partners, so relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s interiority is precise—her calculation of the grain’s split, the haptic heartbeat sync, the cracked voice on “intervention”—and every micro-choice (burying the slower grain, waiting past the rose signal) is driven by a contradiction between scientific duty and private grief. The final refusal to stop shooting until the last click is an earned renunciation that costs her dawnlight and memory. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Flaw: “wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning” drifts toward diagnostic-speak (−0.3); still, embodied cost holds.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s embodied blindness and tactile expertise are vivid; her “magnetic calm” under deadline pressure feels earned. The micro-choice to use water ripples to retrain the drone’s gyro is character-specific and stakes her reputation. Col remains a functional helper rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Still, her final silent release of the drone carries visible cost—she forfeits tactile confirmation of success.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s quietly stubborn curiosity—rooted in childhood and sharpened by six winters of cataloguing failure—drives every move from locking the furnace to descending the rope. Her dry aside “swallowed her editor’s instinct to annotate” encapsulates the wry, self-aware voice that stays consistent under pressure. Interiority is tactile (condensation as Braille, atlas page drinking light) rather than analytic, so we feel thought in her fingertips. The final quiet refusal to transmit coordinates is a believable renunciation born of everything we’ve seen her notice and touch.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is lyrically Specific—“hollow inside his chest where his own bell once hung”—and his self-offering under the archway dramatizes a believable renunciation. The only flaw is that the town-memory figures never apply direct interpersonal pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent by scope, not error. Cost is embodied: he literally dissolves into the tenth bell, a visible forfeiture that satisfies earned stasis. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; embodiment carries the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s compulsive coiling of the copper strap, her salt-tear baptism of the organ console, and the final surrender of the emptied vial crystallize a credible arc from guilt to gift. The interior contradiction—cartographer who maps yet cannot escape—stays embodied, not abstract. Micro-choices (tightening coil, uncorking vial) visibly reorder her hierarchy of values. Cost is palpable: she trades her last unlogged memory for the chord that may outlive her lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cassian’s contradictory motives—inherit the lie, overwrite the lie, become the wolf—are dramatized in every beat (pressing the lattice to stone, stepping onto the impossible stair). His body is salt-bitten, breath metallic, each micro-choice (leaving the lattice behind, taking the heartbeat-hush) visibly priced. The final self-wolfing emerges from prior causal logic, not epiphany. Interiority is concrete (“the hush… became a heartbeat he could finally trust”), never label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—vengeance and tenderness—are dramatized in the bead-transfer beats; the boy’s inherited guilt turns on embodied micro-choices (offering wrist, accepting apricot). Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. Final forgiveness is earned because the bead’s three-century weight is felt in every pulse. Cost is visible: orchard withers, veil falls, she disperses—path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calyx’s interiority is lyrically specific, his surrender to the canyon’s compulsion credibly embodied. The bleeding-palm beat gives us a visible cost tied to his optimism, earning the final renunciation. Yet the shift from passive dream-cargo to active weaver feels slightly under-motivated; we are told he “understood” but not shown the micro-choice that tips him from pawn to agent. Still, the hierarchy of values (story > safety > self) is legible in the final kiss of cloth.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The returnee’s interior contradiction—yearning to heal a faith she no longer trusts—drives every beat; her choice to plant the gnomon in the ruins crystallizes the arc. Micro-choices (kneeling to a skull, aligning the dial on vertebrae) embody embodied cost. The caretaker’s secondary pressure is thin but sufficient; her flaws (exile’s guilt, need for proof) compound until she accepts rooted stasis. Cost is felt: she forfeits further exile and accepts guardianship of an unfinishable rebuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pseudonym creator’s contradictory impulses—send the confession or preserve anonymity—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (chalk spiral, unsigned letter slipped through slot). Interiority stays concrete; the heartbeat under the clipboard anchors the final renunciation. The 30-year backstory is brief, anchored to present stimuli, and tilts the choice. Cost is legible: she keeps the confession, swallowing truth to remain unread—an earned stasis that forecloses future self-reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction is palpable: the embroiderer’s public performance of “senile” quaver versus the surgical precision of her mapping; her heartbeat sync choice is an embodied micro-decision that costs her calm. External behavior (humming murder-list lullaby) misaligns with internal calculus, satisfying the 9+ contradiction test. The final renunciation—returning to stitch new unnamed stars—pays the visible cost of perpetual vigilance, earned by the prior causality chain. No label-speak; every emotional beat is stitched, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s guilt and need to speak the apology are embodied through the moths/letters and the act of kneeling to offer the shard; the moment of handing it over crystallizes change. The brother remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible beats are skipped, yet the interior contradiction—“cruelty could feel like freedom”—is credibly maintained. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: clutch unsent pain → accept shard → speak → release. Cost is felt in the healed lip and empty pockets. Missing on-page interaction with the brother keeps this just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and voice-specific; the translator’s guilt and vocation collide in the coral/ink decryption. Micro-choices—pressing thumb to cast, whispering “I unknot by naming”—alter the dyad with the boy and foreclose the fantasy of neutrality. The shared-birthday revelation lands as earned ironic cost. Flaw: the “lotus-hearted” abstraction momentarily slips toward diagnostic-speak, blunting embodied contradiction by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Luma’s interior contradiction—grief-emptied yet light-full—drives every micro-choice; the fresco shard’s warmth against her ribs externalizes the conflict, and the final renunciation (pocket empty) costs her present sorrow, foreclosing nostalgia as refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete (“methodically playful,” rabbit-skin-glue life), embodied frustration (“ground tilt”), and a final micro-choice that renounces certainty at visible cost. Nested copies dramatize contradictory impulses in-scene; no label-speak. Motivation stays anchored to craft identity; the refusal of closure is earned. Missing secondary pressure keeps her just shy of 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arlo’s charming-rogue voice is vivid—spectacles cracked, gourd rattle always in hand—and every beat is filtered through his taxed-synapses POV. Internal contradiction is alive: he audits his own dreams while seeding rebellion, a tension held to the last image. Micro-choices (burying the seed, reciting Lucretius) visibly cost him surveillance risk. The final smile is earned stasis: he forecloses safety for the city’s spark, price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zale’s centuries-long insomnia and the ache it carves are kept embodied—forehead on limestone, knees on spiral stairs—so the exhaustion feels lived-in. His micro-choice to peel the postcard apart crystallizes the arc: the act both surrenders the relic and plants its charge, a visible cost. The interior contradiction (to keep vigil vs. finally rest) is dramatized, not narrated. Only the “galaxy postcard” knowledge edge feels fractionally smoother than his lived memories; still, motivation holds across the sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—guardian discipline vs. the remembered ache of “Por”—is dramatized in the same beat she chooses to surrender their kiss; foxglove-heart imagery and the fork/quill micro-choice embody motives without label-speak. Each traded memory (cedar-chest scent, pollen kiss) visibly thins her silhouette, making the final self-erasure inevitable and earned. The story’s lyric surface never flattens her into symbol; the systematic gentleness is a lived tic that costs her everything. Almost perfect: a hairline slip where “almost weightless” is told not embodied, but the closure compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” paradox is dramatized twice—triplicate seals while holding a match, then leaving the ink well behind—each move exacts a visible forfeit and locks the trait to closure. Interiority stays concrete: her pulse hammer yet steady hand, ash-and-honey syllables on tongue. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interior contradiction and embodied cost satisfy 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mireya’s calm competence and methodical ritual are vivid, but her interior contradiction—yearning to serve both valleys while fearing failure—remains reported rather than dramatized in body or micro-choice; the final stance is credible yet the emotional cost is stated, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirela’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven hiding vs. song-preserving hope—are alive in every attic beat; the meteorite seeding andInkspot’s micro-sheet flights are micro-choices that cost her ease and safety. The earned vanishing beneath the floorboard lullaby stave pays off her arc with visible forfeiture. Interiority stays concrete: “tasting iron” embodies fear, dust-mote notation externalizes memory. No diagnostic label-speak; voice and action stay fused.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Juniper’s barefoot drift and logbook-to-wood reading embody a consistent, embodied interiority; her “featherly determined” gait shows micro-choice under pressure. Still, the father remains off-page cipher, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics cannot apply. The final “walk the invisible corridors” is a credible renunciation with felt cost—she chooses the between-place over terrestrial home. Yet the interior contradiction peak is narrated rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it shy of the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astrologer’s interiority is vivid—her decision to exhale into the moon-pipe is embodied, irreversible, and costly. The feather’s warmth in her pocket and the final pinions sprouting show a credible, earned transformation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her “gloomy cheer” and the way curiosity flares violet give contradictory impulses live color. Her micro-choice to gather crater-glass shards and re-story the cliff is earned by the shared ache she feels in the ash. The flaw (compulsion to remember) directly shapes the final renunciation: she walks on without looking back, pocketing only the chime of wonder. Voice specificity keeps her from type; “recollectionist” is never explained yet behaves as an occupation of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cipher’s “lightly attentive” observer stance is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (dropping the cup, timing retreat) grows from the tattooed motive to disrupt monotony. Interior contradiction is missing—he never doubts or revises his gamble—so the renunciation at the slot machine feels foregone rather than costly. Still, the hierarchy of values (creativity over coins) is legible and drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysira’s contradictory impulses—court complicity vs. self-erasure—are dramatized in every pirouette; the final renunciation (“Skin ends, verse orbits”) is earned by the moonstone’s visible exhaustion. Interiority stays embodied, never abstract, and the cost of exile is felt in the ankle-biting dawn. Minor slip: “obsidian grace” is repeated as label, not lived sensation, in two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her micro-choice to speak value aloud crystallizes a believable renunciation of utility-logic. The scar-memory to Carina is a vivid self-map, yet the beat remains solitary—no secondary pressure or status shift on the page—so relationship crucible and status bullets are waived. A hairline slip: “constellation Carina” label could have been embodied a beat longer. Closure still lands with felt cost under Earned Stasis, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. need to speak—are alive in every beat; the ash-on-tongue micro-choice crystallizes the hierarchy of values. The spiral ink on wrist carries visible, scaled cost that forecloses anonymity. Interiority is concrete—“tasting childhood campfires”—never diagnostic. Earned stasis lands because silence was a live option now paid for with public exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s lucid-dreamer lens is vivid—equations in her hair, salt-breath sync—but the “observer’s courage / fear²” epiphany arrives as told equation, not embodied choice. Interiority is lush yet stays cerebral; no bodily toll or micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the closure’s cost feels conceptual rather than lived. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and consistent, holding the piece above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s perceptual acuity and inherited dread are fused in every beat; the moment she swallows her great-grandmother’s name, motivation spikes from job to blood-curse. Interiority stays concrete—film negatives brushing her skin—never abstract. The final renunciation—becoming the corridor herself—pays off every micro-choice and is irreversible. Only a trace of over-tidy “legacy’s burden” refrain keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s interior contradiction—yearning to gift the heartbeat yet fearing self-erasement—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation costs her the compass that defined her, a price felt in the sphere’s absence. Embodied emotion arrives in “her own pulse bucked,” “warm against her palm,” grounding the abstract trade. Flaws (solitude-dependence, risk-aversion) actively complicate the climax; no safety-hedging. The heartbeat’s surrender is earned by every prior mirror test and memory forfeit, making the endurance credible.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voss’s gentleness is credibly embodied—he cradles corpses, refuses to demand forgiveness—yet the interiority sometimes drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“he understood the ritual demanded more”) that flattens the peak beat. The clipboard-cradle transformation is earned, but the chorus of arriving mourners is observed more than chosen, so the shared burden feels bestowed rather than seized. Still, his trembling hands and cracked syllables give visceral cost to the name-recital, satisfying the 9- gate for embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philanthropist’s contradictory drives—guilt-ridden architect of drought yet seeker of extinct song—are rendered through embodied micro-choices (barefoot crunch, fingertip tracing cracks, swallowing the note). Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the tear is “inconvenient,” not “he felt sad.” The final swallow is earned: prior causal chain (financed dam, seeded clouds, traced map) makes the self-caging inevitable. Cost is visible: the cuckoo pulse inside his ribcage forecloses any future silence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lys’s interior contradiction—contract-bound chastity vs. awakened desire for collective liberation—is dramatized through bodily choice (barefoot bleeding prints) and renunciation (staying as first non-echo). The mercury-tears-into-stars image externalizes cost, but the “redirected desire” turn is stated more than embodied; a single tactile beat of withheld touch would have sealed the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lucien’s interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—ink-stained fingers, calligraphy as worldview—but the pivot from refusal to acceptance is announced rather than dramatized; the “I will letter whatever words…” pledge arrives without a visible mid-scene micro-choice that costs him anything tangible. The grandmother memory is the only beat that complicates his motive, and it’s delivered as retrospective gloss, not active contradiction. Result: a vivid consciousness whose final stance feels pre-decided.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and character-specific; the narrator’s guilt, craft knowledge, and sensory bias feel lived-in. The decisive moment—threading the card through the rope—crystallizes his renunciation of bronze-forging for breath-capture, paying the cost of letting the paper dissolve. Micro-choices (warming each strand, tasting thaw-water names) embody his hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-analysis. No contradictory impulses are rendered simultaneously in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc of forgiveness to transmission is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“feeling the metal sweat under green fingers,” “laughs, the sound equal parts crystal and rust”). The protagonist’s contradiction—born without past/future yet deciding to let the storm walk her—crystallizes late but with visible cost (wafer seal fused into second skin, name unthreaded). Micro-choices are imagistic rather than tactical; still, the renunciation feels earned because the prior dream-bird map dramatized the inevitability of being worn smooth. Voice coherence and perceptual signature are strong; minor cap because she observes more than she forces events.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Naram-bel’s interior contradiction—faith in number vs. fear of empirical irony—drives every beat; the final vow of silence costs him bodily presence, foreclosing return. Micro-choices (trading barley, pressing tile to copper) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible price. The sister memory is the only emotional vent; still, it lands as lived, not label. No second character on page, so status bullets waived; single-POV depth sustains pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s pacifist cunning is shown through her weaponized lullaby-box; the moment she accepts her own shadow-anger metabolizes into the same carbon as wheat fields, her interior contradiction combusts on the page and legitimizes the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority stays embodied—”cellar crumble inside her chest”—rather than diagnostic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: broken pin over rifle, shared silence over speech, renunciation of the box over possession. The only drag is the late-arriving shadow-self; its blade-sharp accusation is powerful but slightly under-cued, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mirror maker’s interior contradiction—longing to dissolve boundaries yet needing to reclaim her own dream—remains embodied in every breath and micro-choice; the bleeding palm and restored sextant crystallize her cost and earned reintegration. Motive intensifies cleanly from stalled mirror → orchard return → blood payment → dream rooted. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Closure choice is causally earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mender’s contradictory impulses—defiance and caretaking—are dramatized through embodied choices (barred doors with pruning hook, grafting at dawn). Interiority is specific to profession: quartz monocle, pollen, cambium under fingers. The final stance of refusal carries visible cost: orchard bars elders, ribbon rots into bark, scent of coconut/copper drifts citywide—earned stasis that forecloses reconciliation but preserves the grove. Daughter’s awed touch on new cambium crystallizes the generational transfer without sentimental summary.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is luminous: the zero-g vomit, the spiral shell pressed to her lips, the drain swallowing her birthdays—each beat bodies her panic and curiosity. Her contradictory drives—to keep her past intact yet gorge on future fruit—play simultaneously, not in alternation. The final merger into “book and librarian” is foreshadowed by her lifelong log-keeping and the mirror-page, so the renunciation feels earned, costly, and irreversible. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; even epiphany is rendered as tactile gesture (tucking the shell into the sky’s spine).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly dramatized (paper compass, seed-word bargain) and costs her a year of life, but the time traveler remains a mere plot hinge—his interiority summarized, not embodied. The diary-as-extension-of-voice tightens the link between tool and motive, yet relational pressure is absent. The final renunciation earns its poignancy because the price was tactile, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fused twin’s contradictory impulses (left-foot loves heights / right-foot craves depth) are dramatized in every stride; the final shared lung-breath is earned by the syllable-gathering quest. Interiority stays embodied—heartbeat at the porthole, sigh in the spine—without diagnostic labels. Cost is visible: the ship sinks, the name is too large for one throat, forcing perpetual co-identity. The only bar to 9+ is that the sister’s interiority is reported more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” nature is dramatized in every tactile micro-choice—cataloging absences by touch, braiding rope into a village—so the trait constrains and enables the climax. Interiority stays concrete (“the pendulum's heartbeat felt like a question”) without diagnostic self-talk. The final act of coiling still-warm rope shows visible cost: she has literally woven her own life-time into the void, a renunciation earned by thirty years of pattern-reading. No label drift or competence without struggle; the flaw (over-trust in cataloging) is the very tool that lets her save the erased village.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapkeeper’s silence-craft and memory-preservation motive are vivid and embodied; her tactile micro-choices (ice augury, stone-knotting) show a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the apprentice remains a functional echo rather than a crucible, so the relationship axis is under-used. The final renunciation—“We were here”—lands as earned stasis because every swallowed word has been dramatized as cargo. Still, Jalen’s absence of interiority keeps the dyad from becoming a true relational furnace.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The custodian’s interior contradiction—retrocognition as curse yet compass—drives every micro-choice; the moment she pries the fused shard from child-bone, her pulse counts “every mistake” and the cost calcifies into forward-cast resolve, earning the climactic renunciation of isolation. Embodied emotion is vivid (“fracture edges warm as if remembering light”), never label-speak. Only the mother’s off-page death keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.4)
    The archivist’s contradictory hunger for both purity and synthesis is dramatized in every tactile beat: snapping her own quill, pressing borrowed memories into melting fog-pellets, choosing “fragment is also form.” Interiority is concrete—she kneels, palms cool crystal, feels a stranger’s lake-dive burst inside her skull—never abstract. The final renunciation (leaving the translucent self-sculpture) is earned by the entire measurable shadow-triangulation sequence and costs her the archive’s promised coherence. Flaw: one heartbeat of “preemptively nostalgic” drifts toward label-speak, but it is immediately enfleshed by the raindrop that “carries nothing of the past.”

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luma’s defiance-of-despair motive is declared early and drives every beat; her micro-choice to trade shell-for-knot, to dust the sentry, to kneel and conceal the fuse all flow from that urge. Interiority stays concrete—“lost starlight pool behind her eyes”—rather than abstract. The final renunciation (empty satchel, road ahead) costs her the literal tools of her craft, so the path is foreclosed on the page. Governor’s stunted antagonism is sketchy, but the single-POV keeps pressure pinned to her, not spread thin; no label-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s habit of sidelong noticing is dramatized in every gesture—touching tide-words, offering the cicada palm-up—and the daughter’s mirrored “sideways watching” shows a credible shift. Interiority stays concrete (“texture of time… something that can be touched while it disappears”) and the final renunciation of grievance is earned by the pool-side silence and shared warmth. Minor deduction: the wife back-story is delivered in a single expository parcel rather than being probed under pressure, so the emotional cost feels slightly pre-packaged.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s claustrophobia is embodied in every tactile step she takes on yielding planks; her micro-choice to count only three forward before letting panic settle is specific and costly. Interiority stays concrete—no “I am afraid” labels, just the doll’s chipped eyes and the membrane clinging like gold leaf. The final release of stored silences is earned because we have watched her hoard each one under escalating pressure. Only the keeper’s single-scene status keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nilo’s soft throttle and whispered instruction show gentle, consistent agency, but interiority stays atmospheric (“vaulting hush”) rather than contradictory. The commuter’s fear is voiced once, crystallized, then released—cost is felt, yet lacks prior friction or micro-choice dramatized inside him. Relationship pressure is minimal (single brief exchange), so status dynamics and secondary pressure bullets are N/A. The arc lands as a credible renunciation of noise, but deeper interior contradiction would sharpen the emotional scalp.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lore-keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing ruby mortar, her implant syncing with ancient circuits—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs lineage duty) are stated more than dramatized. The final acceptance of bridged responsibility is credible, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because we see no moment where she nearly chooses otherwise. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“teaching herself to suffocate properly”—and scars glow only when shared, grounding the ghost-therapy. Yet the keeper’s own suffocation is told, not dramatized in a present beat, so her final “beginning” feels foreshadowed rather than freshly earned. Still, micro-choice (ring pressed to boy’s absent heart) visibly alters both souls and links their cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—"feeling the cold brass echo the pressure inside her chest"—and her contradictory impulses (survivor guilt v. vengeful mischief) animate every beat. The bolt-twist micro-choices escalate from curiosity to diamond-forgiveness, paying visible palm-blood cost. Parallel-Liras chorus could feel gimmicky, but their texts act as externalized conscience, forcing real-time value trade-offs. The refusal of the morning shift crystallizes earned stasis: she will no longer barter flesh for borrowed gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Arin’s interiority is vivid—“tears mixing with dust to make pale mud”—but the dynastic guilt is inherited rather than personally earned, so the moral cost feels second-hand. The final renunciation is telegraphed early and thus lacks a contradictory impulse that would complicate the choice. Micro-choices (kneeling, wrapping the wound with the map) are concrete and value-revealing, yet the stakes plateau after the confession is heard; no new flaw is exposed or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The knight’s interior contradiction—shame-armored yet yearning to atone—drives every micro-choice; the surrender of his body to star-wood is credibly foreshadowed by his choreography of self-erasure. The final wooden stance is an earned renunciation: he pays with eternal suspension and the loss of all futures he can no longer choose. The only slip is a shade of therapeutic self-label (“withdrawn”) that leaks through the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowan’s interiority is vivid—her fingertip “tracing a scab,” the heartbeat skip at the button—but the final beat (whispering Marcus into snow) is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her something. Earlier beats are observation-heavy; the dust-reading is luminous yet passive, so the shift to active archival intervention feels slightly under-cooked in causality. Still, her contradictory desire—stipend versus secret vigil—stays alive in every beat, and the button re-centers her great-uncle wound without exposition. The endurance arc (keeping the button in play for a future seeker) earns a credibly weighted stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The saxophonist’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied—his raw throat, the reed fluttering “like a trapped moth,” the velvet pressure on his chest. His refusal to let the prophecy speak its final clause is earned through a lifetime of ritual and the visible cost of erasing the note. The only minor slack is that the villagers’ faces are summarized rather than staged, so the external pressure feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mireya’s gentle obsession with forgotten things is shown through tactile seed-sorting and miniature monument building; her interiority remains crisp, never drifting into label-speak. The moment she palms the moonstone dust and sees the mirrored arbor above, her renunciation (releasing the last fragment) carries visible cost—she palms moss instead of power. Yet the transformation reads as quiet acceptance rather than wrenching contradiction; a sharper internal fracture would have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clutching the compass yet craving uncertainty—are dramatized in the submerged moment where he deliberately leaves both artifacts behind. The cost is visceral: lungs burn, watch rusts, career ends. Interiority stays concrete (“time slacken…a droplet refusing to fall”) without diagnostic talk. Micro-choices (“left both objects…walked into fog”) crystallize renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurelia’s interiority is sensuously embodied—tears as reagent, balance-beam tremor—without lapsing into therapeutic self-diagnosis. The twin-shaped absence escalates from pocket-weight to sternum-anchor through four explicit “limit” experiments, each a micro-choice that visibly alters her stance. The final calibration—stepping out to teach others how to carry luminous regret—pays off every prior ounce of measured grief with earned, legible cost. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “names are not chains but counterweights” edges toward maxim, not lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “modestly fearless” interiority is shown through embodied micro-choices—pressing the tooth to her lips, kneeling on lichen—rather than labels. The contradictory impulse to cradle death-splinters while craving their laughter drives every beat. The final absorption of the giggle is earned: the same tooth that once reassured her dissolves, proving the collector pays with her own body. A hairline slip: the boy’s “cheeks blue with cold but eyes bright” is a touch too picturesque for a drowned child, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (laughter as decimal place, need to quantify mercy) drive every beat; the interior math is embodied in bruise-colored sap prints and the copper taste of the interrogator’s grin. The final renunciation—laying down the pewter strap—pays the accumulated cost of identity erosion, earned by the iterative equations carved into skin and bark. Only flaw: the “mathematics of mercy” thesis is stated early and often, nudging toward diagnostic-speak, but the relentless sensorial anchoring keeps it from abstract lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulse—clutching the fragment yet surrendering it to child-self—crystallizes in one embodied beat (“I unfasten the cord…offer the adult-worn fragment”). Interiority stays concrete, tied to tide-hum and lullaby, not labels. The renunciation costs the adult identity built around ferrying ghosts, shown by the heavier absence; only the brief “translator no longer” skirts diagnostic speak, keeping this just outside 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her micro-choices under ghost-pressure reveal a believable split between mechanical competence and existential vertigo. The final refusal to lift the barrel is credibly foreshadowed by the looping image of herself already inside the elevator, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown, not told, and the blown-fuse child ghost acts as an externalization of her own stalled circuits. Minor dip: the “weightless burden” coat metaphor is repeated without fresh twist, slightly flattening the embodied emotion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Corwin’s cracked-chase heart and trembling ink-stained fingers give us embodied, idiosyncratic interiority; his micro-choice to uncork the whisper against the keeper’s warning crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The lone flaw: the mirror-keeper dissolves off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implicitly implied, slightly under-cooking secondary-character traction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to reimagine—are dramatized in the shard-handling beats; her final renunciation is earned by the mirrored storm ordeal and costs her corporeal self. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow that lacquers”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the archaeologist enters so late that status dynamics can’t complicate her, capping relationship-as-crucible utility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory fear of the dark versus his vocation of mending sound is embodied in the tremor he follows and the confession he risks; the chip-to-song tether crystallizes his paternal guilt and reclamation motive with visible cost—his public admission and the permanent conversion of the chip into city-wide dawn. Interiority stays concrete (“mending what isn’t torn” as tactile paradox). Micro-choice hierarchy (daughter’s unfinished lullaby vs. civic salvation) is legible and irreversible. No significant motivational drift; the moment he relinquishes the keepsake, the path forecloses believably.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivy’s interiority is vivid—her knees buckle under borrowed awe, she corks longing into vials—and every micro-choice (uncorking all vials, accepting the second heart) grows from her established collector/seeker identity. The final renunciation is earned: she pays with her solitary humanity to become the hinge itself. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however; the internal split is implied rather than dramatized live, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maela’s interiority is concrete—her chisel rings, her fingers test wood, her pulse syncs with the lantern’s spin. The spiral burn in the heartwood and her choice to drown the GPS embody earned renunciation with visible cost. No contradiction in motive; every micro-choice (wedging the slide, carving with the grain) reveals her hierarchy of values. The only bar to 9+ is that the storm’s agency slightly overshadows her final proactive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora’s quietly driven need is palpable and consistent, but her interiority stays in lyric register—more observation than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final stance (leaving the pavilion) is legible as renunciation, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we feel the idea of loss rather than a specific forfeiture on the page. Micro-choices (painting on glass, lying under branch-rosette) show values, but they are staged as ritual, not dilemma. Enough for solid characterization, short of the visible cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mireya’s interiority is fierce and specific—“throat full of salt,” “years rearrange inside me”—and every shell-scrawl she trades is a micro-choice that costs her a future she names. The contradiction between professional archivist and filial complicity is embodied in the cradle-drop and the oilskin wrap, not abstractly confessed. The closing decision to broadcast rather than bury is earned by the prior cascade of irreversible bodily inscriptions. Only the mother’s betrayal feels slightly under-dramatized on-page, a hairline nick that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s stoic solitude is viscerally embodied—every lantern-fold and ash-ink stroke externalizes an inner contradiction between remembrance and refusal of comfort. His monologue to the bottle crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth > resurrection myths) with tangible cost: the town stays empty, the bottle stays sealed. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status tests are waived; the single-POV interiority is specific, chemically precise, never lapsing into therapeutic self-labeling. The final renunciation of the bottle is fully earned by the prior ritual of burning scroll-carrying lanterns, making the endurance legible and painful.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ambrose’s contradiction—archivist of promises now forced to become the living archive of broken ones—peaks when he writes the Hittite word and feels the orchard tilt; the cost is embodied, irreversible, and foreshadowed by his childhood memory. Micro-choices (tweezers, quince-ink stylus, pressing forehead to palm) tether occult premise to corporal stakes. Interiority stays concrete: “a low note that would hum whenever someone…broke a promise” gives the cosmic curse a bodily residence. Flaw: passive reception of prophecy slightly outweighs active decision, capping at 8.9.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: wax shaving → vision → dissolving ribbon → ledger braille each intensify texture and re-weight the stake (“the archive had inverted”). Closure is a Charged Poise: Ambrose waits to answer in “a voice neither alive nor dead, only remaining,” making the conceptual cost undeniable. The 1958 memory is the single allowed reflective block (~18% of text) and it tilts present stance by revealing he has always been the vessel. Orientation, transitions, and causal ripple all serve this final crystallization.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop orchard, phonograph shard, quince-ink, and 2 000-year palm seed are all specific, never decorative; each constrains choice (wax demands tweezers, tree hosts the ledger, ink becomes stylus). The foghorn’s absence is felt as atmospheric pressure, not mentioned color. Spatial choreography stays clean across single rooftop zone. Sensory hierarchy obeys an archivist’s gaze: grooves, translucence, braille texture prioritized over visual panorama. Only micro-slip: date-palm seed detail late-introduced yet accepted as accelerant for final image.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Ambrose silence the accidental prophecy or embody it? Escalation is textural: every beat adds density—wax lands, speaks, dissolves; fruits bear faces; ledger rises in braille—until the only path left is endurance. Cost is visible: his pulse is “stored in their unresolved chords.” No reversal, yet deepening forces stance crystallization precisely as accumulative design demands.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as debt—emerges through images rather than assertion: the shaving “remembering something it had never been given,” fruit-mouths silently accusing, braille that wants to be read after sight fails. Final image reweights premise: the city will feel “an ache it could not name,” turning the entire skyline into a braille text of broken promises. No moral is offered; ambiguity is purposeful and haunting.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-archivist: precise Latinate diction (“medlar,” “xylem,” “consecrated”) yet modulates into liturgical cadence for prophecy. Perceptual signature filters world through tactile antiquity—sound grooves, wax warmth, ink sinking into fiber—never sliding into tour-guide exposition. Compression (“quinces rustled without wind”) taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so cadence control carries entire emotional arc; succeeds.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Sentence music is deliberate but never cloying: long breathless clauses mimic foghorn sustain, then fracture into single-word fragments (“only remaining”). Metaphors stay internally coherent (wax as ribbon, orchard as tuning fork). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or pressure. Minor density spike in paragraph 4 where three metaphors stack, but pattern serves accelerando to vision release, hence forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The seed saver’s interiority is vivid—gloved palm on glass, acorn cap warming in pocket—but her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. circulate) are stated more than dramatized. The final choice to split the vortex between seeds and self is credible and costly, yet the micro-moment of hesitation that would make it felt is compressed into lyric summary rather than embodied beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific logger vs. mountain listener—drives every micro-choice; the final toggle is earned because her father’s soap-scented rope and the annual pitch-drop anchor the cost of disobedience. Credibly curious trait is embodied, not labeled, in barometer logs and midnight splice. Missing 0.3 to reach 9: no second character on page, so status crucible unused; still, solitary stance crystallizes with felt risk of civic ban.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The janitor’s grief-for-the-sky is anchored in granular micro-choices—whispering apologies, leaving dome open—so interiority stays embodied. His contradictory impulse (cling vs. release) is dramatized when he palms the warm charcoal fleck, fusing personal loss to cosmic scale. The final renunciation of the lantern is earned: prior beats show the glass hoarding memories, so surrendering its glow carries visible cost. Voice remains singular, never sliding into diagnostic self-talk; “soft meteor of grief” is image, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alden’s interiority is richly textured—his “tranquilly perceptive” stance is embodied in soot-stung palms and the escalating weight in his chest. The moment he whispers “I will hold you…” fractures his vowed silence, showing contradictory impulses in scene with felt cost. Ghosts act as secondary pressure, but their mute eloquence keeps relationships abstract; still, his final choice to stay and share the burden is causally earned. One hairline slip: “understanding flooded him through contextual clues” edges toward diagnostic summary at the climax, dulling embodied immediacy a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The timekeeper’s tactile obsession with the urn fragment and price-tag ledger gives a consistent, embodied motive; his climb and final trade show a micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“metallic dust that settled on the tongue”). Yet the closing swap feels lightly motivated—no prior contradiction or flaw is risked or paid, so the renunciation cost is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The poet’s renunciation of “finishing the chord” is earned through seven years of failed completion; the micro-choice to press the torn feather into sand and speak the first line shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—“words tasted of salt and iron”—and the final Earned Stasis (letting the tide erase the sentence) forecloses the path of completion with visible forfeiture. The chipped-tooth smile and sleeve-strip tuning add tactile flaws that complicate the bond without tidy symmetry. No label-speak; contradiction between longing for wholeness and commitment to fracture drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—copper warm from her pocket, heart racing at the spiral’s completion—yet the “brazen calm” stance edges toward performed label, not fully lived contradiction. The six-month deadline converts abstract prognosis into tactile urgency, but the orchard’s sentient cooperation is accepted without visible doubt, muting authentic struggle. Final renunciation lands with cost: she walks away leaving pulse-wired footprints, her name dissolved into conductor. Fox kits chasing blue sparks externalizes consent, but Mara's own fear of dying is never allowed to tangle with her resolve, so depth stays one note short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is dense, embodied, and contradictory—her drive to “prove return is a reaction, not a reunion” collides with the involuntary inhalation of spores that floods her with body-level memory. Micro-choices (pressing amber to eroded bronze, inhaling against will) externalize the conflict; the final renunciation—burying the emptied shard—pays the cost of her stance. No safety-hedging: she is brilliant, abrasive, and still poisoned by nostalgia. The fly-dissolution beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge > belonging, even when the price is cellular.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coachman’s renunciation of violence and embrace of seed-bearing is earned through a chain of embodied micro-choices (pod selection, tongue bleeding, feather placement) that externalize his interior contradiction between mourning and repair. His dead-language fluency is not a label but a visceral pressure—“hummed inside his ribs like bees that had forgotten the sun”—and the final silence of those languages after the scattering feels like a limb amputated on the page. Cost is visible: literal blood on the living tongue, the cedar box now empty, the carriage permanently re-purposed. The gull relationship functions as a crucible, forcing him to translate between species and thereby confront the human-oath he must now keep alone.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Scraps’ shift from corpse-tracker to life-finder is embodied in every sniff and limp; the nose-to-syntax beat inside the archive shows interiority without label-speak. Kite’s micro-choices—barefoot slide down rebar, fingers on the crank—externalize grief and trust. Brother’s emergence reprises the riddle, proving the hound’s new vocation costs her nothing yet renames her: the courier who teaches distance to kneel. Only the brother’s sudden poetic fluency feels slightly unearned, a hairline slip at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s survivor-guilt and ritual need are vivid; the contradictory pull between grief and wonder is embodied in trembling hands and the burning compass. The final hand-take is a believable surrender to a mother-shaped “true north,” renouncing linear time. No secondary character pressure, but interiority sustains the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vespers’ motive—swap certainty for wonder—remains consistent, embodied in the upward-fall rule and the sundial pass-off. Internal contradiction is only summarized (“decided to become an apprentice of wonder instead of a duchess”), not dramatized mid-scene, so the pivotal queen-sacrifice beat feels pre-explained. The final gift to the child reprises her mentor pattern, earning a credible hand-off, yet Halcyon’s fear-of-heights secret is never leveraged to pressure her tactics, leaving status dynamics one-note. Micro-choices show hierarchy (sacrifice queen → accept stair), but emotional layering is compressed; we are told risk tastes like “aurora” rather than shown body-cost on the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s contradictory training as a fake-crier turned real archivist of tenderness is dramatized in embodied micro-moves (kneeling, knotting lace, heel-toe-heel). Her final refusal to flee with Kestrel but instead carry the board away crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over survival—whose cost is felt when the gallery seals behind them. Interiority stays concrete ("tasted like iron and lilac") and never resorts to therapy-speak. The one flaw: Kestrel’s shift from blank rifle to gentle muzzle-on-square relies more on symbolic staging than on prior seeds of his vulnerability; still, the moment lands because the blankness itself was pre-established.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seer’s renunciation of prophecy is embodied and charged—her cracked reflection falls as “silver rain,” a tactile cost. Interior contradiction is strong: she hungers for home yet fears chaining others. The micro-choice to crack her own mirrored skin rather than re-plant talents crystallizes values, but the townspeople stay abstract, blunting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s guilt-driven exile and his need to “winnow” regret into usable remorse are palpable; the micro-choice to right the fallen king crystallizes his arc. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles blanch, breath moves—avoiding label-speak. The single flaw: the duke’s daughter is off-stage, so the relationship crucible is rhetorical rather than tested in scene; this keeps the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—“refusal echoed in her ribs”—and her micro-choice to climb the spire while clutching a mirror shard embodies the contradictory impulse to scatter blame yet seek absolution. The final whispered “I accept the cost” is earned by the cascade of self-cast echoes she endures; the feather’s arrival is the visible price. No second character present, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean. Voice remains singular and stained with guilt throughout, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice; the moment she straps in and accepts the sinking, her endurance is earned by the prior liturgy of dots and the mother-charm’s weight. The only drag is a sliver of diagnostic self-talk (“Damage accepted. Meaning achieved.”) that momentarily surfaces mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ren’s interiority is specific—the salt taste as memory, the decision to leave the door unlocked—and his brush-trembling micro-choices under pressure feel earned. The “intimately aloof” trait is more asserted than dramatized until the cave sequence, where it finally costs him human contact; before that, the label floats. The closing renunciation (leaving the canvas) crystallizes a believable, scaled cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s causality clause, yet the slight early over-label prevents a clean 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the assistant’s grief and need to “prove whispers travel farther” drive every beat. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—intent is monolithic—so the psychological edge is blunted. The final beckoning gesture is credible and charged, earning the endurance stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The navigator’s contradictory desire to reclaim lost places while becoming the place others will navigate is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—soldering her hair, speaking names into bronze—each carrying visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; “the censer foot rubbing into her thigh like a bruise shaped like home” fuses sensation and motive. Final surrender is credibly foreshadowed by the motif of weight fluctuation, so when seams loosen and mercury weeps the renunciation feels inevitable, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—rationales war against raw empathy—play out in live, embodied beats (“I will occlude you” vs. kneeling to drink the luminous mud). Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and forces a costly micro-choice at the orchard floor that forecloses muting the communal echo. The final stance—carry rather than erase—pays off prior causality with visible cost: the glass eye fuses to his scar, tethering him. Only minor passivity in the mid-section while the storm “does” things keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is vivid—her bones “humming,” the fingerprint “smelling of glacier wind”—and her micro-choice to release the flower drains memory with felt cost. The double who “mimed with a half-second delay” externalizes her split without diagnostic speak. Yet the stranger remains a cipher: his collapse imports death but gives no reciprocal pressure, so her motivation to “decode” him is abstract, not a crucible. Still, the earned renunciation and the cleaner isolation that follows qualify for high-band even if the relational axis is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s quiet dissatisfaction is clear, but the “empirically intuitive” trait is only asserted; we never see him reason from evidence under stress. The final step through the doorway is motivated by a generic fear/possibility binary rather than by a specific, earned contradiction within him. Interiority drifts toward paraphrase (“he understood then…”) instead of embodied thought. Enough micro-choices exist to keep him functional, yet the absence of a visible cost or flaw that complicates the transit caps credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses—dread of erasure vs. need to save her people—pulse in every beat; the final self-crowning is earned by the prior memory hemorrhage. Micro-choice chain (climb / press bleeding starlight to palms / step onto dais) externalizes the hierarchy of values with escalating cost. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic labels; instead, “tasting iron, tasting endings” bodies out her terror. Flaw drives action: her earlier blindness to prophecy directly hastens the forgetting that forces her ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corin’s interiority is vivid—his “throat tightened,” “scientifically romantic mind,” and the exact micro-choice of crushing the sphere enact a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between quantifying emotion and surrendering to unmeasurable presence is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Mira’s status shift from friend to chosen co-architect of the new method is legible in the deliberate-accidental finger brush and her whisper. Final renunciation is earned: seven years of distilled suns abandoned in one beat whose cost glows on their joined palms.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chronicler’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her jealousy of past selves, her professional reflex to “distill chaos into narrative,” her willingness to sign a contract with erosion—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (letting the scroll vanish) is earned by the spiral of envy and the felt cost of erasure. Flaw: the eagle-flight is reported memory, not dramatized choice, so the split-self stakes never fully crystallize in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is sensorially concrete—her fingertip “reading” of steel threads replaces lost scent—and her need to midwife meaning from absence drives every beat. The clamp screw’s warmth and quarter-turn reorientation crystallize her Earned Stasis: she accepts the hollow nose but pockets the screw, foreclosing the fantasy of molecular return while claiming a new vocation. Micro-choices (tracing threads, rotating the scar) enact the theme without diagnostic label-speak. Flaws (passivity during Horace’s absence) are minor and do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lina’s held-breath terror and brother-grief are viscerally embodied; the micro-choice to keep drawing while her lungs crystallize shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. The split quill at the end is a perfect external trace of internal cost. Interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction (“story torn from the world”), softening the psychological precision demanded at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The exorcist’s guilt and need to fix her worst mistake anchor every beat; her body registers current, scent, silence as embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—rosin on tongue, microtonal hum in wrist—without slipping into label-speak. Only flaw: the sister-ghost flickers in as pure symbol rather than a second will exerting unpredictable pressure, so relationship crucible reads slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrically specific (“tasted of starlight and dust”), but the witness’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the single micro-choice—kneeling to surrender memories—earns its renunciation, yet the erasure of identity feels abstract rather than embodied, softening the cost that should cap the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Torvald’s interiority is concrete—his pulse against the key, the counter-clock turn—but the “guardian of humanity’s collective memory” is asserted, not dramatized. The because/therefore chain that links his daughter’s death to the uphill water to his final reversal is legible; cost is felt when the station dissolves. Still, the profession’s mythic payload is grander than any on-page relationship, so the crucible remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s grief-driven precision and spatial gift are shown through tactile choices—mapping spores, chaining laser dots, synchronizing heartbeats—so the final merge feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“quiet wildfire racing her pulse”) and avoids label-speak. The twin-Luc beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth matters less than release. Cost is felt when the survivor’s eyes remain “unreadable,” keeping ambiguity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory inheritance—mathematical mind vs addictive blood—stays embodied in tremoring hands and lantern grip; the diary-wager device externalizes inner conflict without therapy-speak. The final micro-choice to ride the line end-to-end and seed the city with annotated clover pages turns insight into physical, visible cost: she forfeits anonymity and previous detachment. One slip: “widen perspectives responsibly” is stated motive before any dramatized friction; still, subsequent beats earn the shift. The earned stance crystallizes when she scratches “For the next exception,” a visible foreclosing of the old, distancing loop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The operator’s cultivated estrangement is dramatized through embodied ritual (wiping condensation, logging zero calls) and micro-choices under pressure; the final renunciation of the disc and the loop is credibly foreshadowed and costs him his entire constructed identity. Interior contradiction is vivid—simultaneous craving for and terror of connection—without diagnostic self-labeling. The lone flaw: the woman’s sudden adult appearance is announced rather than prepared, so her stake feels second-hand; still, the operator’s earned stasis caps the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—archive vs. relinquish the locket—drives every micro-choice; the final graft costs her the talisman and redefines her role from collector to sower. Embodied pulse-warm silver, salt-stung knees, creaking joints ground motive in body. Renunciation is earned: the tube-sealing beat forecloses retrieval and charges the daughter’s piano waltz with absence. Flaw: “haunted euphoria” is named twice rather than shown through bodily contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kit’s jocular armor against loneliness is embodied from the first tin-can joke to the final leaf-wave; the moon-rock talisman and logbook gift show micro-choice hierarchies under pressure. His interiority stays concrete—"voice cracking like old paint"—and the decision to leave the station is earned through the reciprocal swaps he orchestrated. Lila functions less as full crucible than charming catalyst; her "moon-tax" punchline lands, but her own stakes remain sketchy, capping the score just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the blind mapmaker’s perception through taste, tremor, and ring-feedback is specific and continuous. Contradictory impulses—yearning for coherence vs terror of self-mapping—are present but stated more than dramatized in-scene, preventing 9+. The final renunciation (carrying the map under skin, never printing) is credibly foreshadowed and carries cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the micro-turn is slightly under-played.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory drives—certitude vs. epistemic humility—are dramatized in every beat: she touches the viewport, uncaps the dry pen, rewrites her own error. The “confidently uncertain” trait is not labeled but performed: her hand steadies because doubt is operational. Micro-choices (naming filaments, easing curvature) visibly change her relational state with the cosmos and with her own past. The ending lands in Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual rewriting as job description, feet warming in reconfigured gravity—cost felt, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The advisor’s motive—translating silence into music—remains lyrical abstraction rather than embodied hunger; we witness no interior contradiction or micro-choice that risks anything tangible. His “quiet charisma” is asserted externally (dogs bow, drunks straighten) but never contradicted or tested, so the trait is flat. Because he lacks stakes that can be lost, the final renunciation (leaving the camera) registers as atmospheric exit, not earned cost. The character intrigues but never crystallizes into a self with something vital on the line.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ember’s pyromaniac/archivist contradiction is vivid, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“volcanic tenderness,” “analytically intuitive mind”) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The climactic self-redefinition is prepared but stated more than dramatized; we are told she is now “keeper of truth,” not shown a micro-choice that seals it. Grandmother’s off-screen whisper acts as external motivator rather than internal fracture line, blurring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—urge to purge foreign memories yet tenderness toward the chorus—play out in embodied drumming and wading choices. The final slowed lullaby-tempo is earned: every prior beat rehearsed the possibility of communal inhalation. Cost is visible: her chest clears only after she surrenders solo ownership of pulse. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s familiarity with the labyrinth is credible through sensory memory and the reveal that her hand-drawn maps are incomplete, but interiority stays surface-level—no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Her decision to trust the stranger and lead her in is declared, not wrestled-with; we see no micro-choice where cost is weighed. The moment she “understands” the acoustic purpose reads as an external verdict rather than an internal fracture. Voice remains competent but generic; the occupational lens never shapes syntax or priority.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s muteness-origin flashback lands late yet still tilts her present stance; the mirrored star-helix choice is embodied and irreversible. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into lyric cadence rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. The coat-as-wing, ankle-kiss of wet plank, and tear-taste are vivid, specific, and fused to motive. No second on-page character means status/relationship bullets are waived; the solitary crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is richly particular—she “hears unspoken words” as wind, a trait that drives every micro-choice from pocketing the grotto to wiring the town’s windows. The contradiction between her disciplined coach identity and illicit nighttime planter is dramatized in action, not labels. Cost is visible: she steps into pale morning “coat collar soaked in starlight,” having foreclosed her own safety for a rule-set she can never again enforce. Only the faint safety-hedge of “nobody had asked for” keeps her from full moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her refusal to let the island ghost away from her is rooted in dockside muscle memory and a lifelong choreography between pulleys and rage. The scrimshaw’s heat against her hip and her whispered “I’m not your guilt, Jack; I’m your exit wound” dramatize contradictory impulses in real time. The final renunciation—slipping the carving back to the sea—pays for the new cadence she claims, but the beat is so lyrically compressed that the cost is felt more as image than as palpable forfeiture, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—reporting neighbors yet forging joy coupons—embodies ambiguity under grief, but her micro-choices (narrating to flowers, carving the feather) feel slightly performative rather than stake-altering; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost, yet the shift from blankness to “lighter shoulders” leans on image more than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    The poet’s interior contradiction—yearning to erase borders yet fearing the lake’s re-freeze—is dramatized in her slowed heartbeat micro-choice at the water’s edge. Embodied emotion (pulse recognized by quartz, warmth inside ribs) is specific, never abstract. The final renunciation—stepping onto liquid that could still harden—pays the full price of her recusant past and lands as Earned Stasis with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s color-blindness is dramatized through embodied searching for “impossible plumage,” and his later violent chromatic overload is a credible perceptual rupture. The interior contradiction—yearning for color yet recoiling from its violence—drives every micro-choice. Rosa’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown, not labeled, when she palms the marble eye and tucks the reed behind her ear; the trade costs her the reed’s song and costs Milo his monochrome safety. Earned stasis lands when he renounces painting for arranging, the marble eye returned, its starlight dimmed yet lesson permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bell ringer’s interior contradiction—mourning silence yet seeking new music—remains verbal; no embodied flare of breath, pulse, or tremor anchors it. Her single decisive act (arranging broken chimes, singing a new hybrid song) is vivid, but the turn from preservation to creation is declared rather than shown through micro-cost: she never hesitates, sweats, or risks a wrong note. The collectors function as a chorus whose immediate pressure is abstract; their dismantling of gear lacks individual stakes, so the relationship crucible test is moot. The earned stasis lands—she walks away unburdened—yet the price (no bells, no fragments) is named, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The jeweler’s grief is palpable through tactile ritual (folding, placing), but interiority drifts into abstract thesis (“teach the dead to bloom”) rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation of preservation is legible, yet the moment of decision to leave feels summarized, not pressured. No secondary character present, so status crucible unused. Earned stasis is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained soles picking up foil flecks is a perfect micro-choice. The inherited-mystery drive gives her a credible, non-therapeutic lens on her own obsession. No second character on the page, so relationship crucible is N/A; her sole contradiction—needing to know yet sealing the map—lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the tin, the footprints, empty pockets). The only bar to 9+ is that the final renunciation is more gestural than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s interiority is lyrically specific—her palm on the bronze prism, the veil drinking sweat—but her contradictory impulses (erase vs. carry memory) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—removing the veil, becoming “just a woman”—is earned by the prior accumulation of images, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied at the instant of choice. The atoms-of-nostalgia conceit supplies texture but occasionally abstracts emotion into label-speak (“anguished joy”). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices are present but diffused across poetic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her mother’s stone, the warming pulse, the decision to swallow the planet—yet the “shadow unbound” is asserted more than dramatized, so the contradictory-impulses test is only half-passed. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but the moment of internal fracture (the shadow slipping out) is summarized rather than felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miren’s interior contradiction—preaching trust while complicit in harm—drives every micro-choice; the ring-drop, hair-loosening, page-burning triad embodies visible cost. The final release of Aster is credible renunciation earned by prior dismantling of ego. No second character on page, so no status dynamics penalty. Slight diagnostic tilt in “balanced like equal weights on a scale arm,” but embodied heartbeat-through-scales rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s grief-driven need to trade her own pulse for closure is viscerally embodied (“tasting iron and lilac,” palm softening stone into loam). Internal contradiction—yearning to bleed yet fearing the memory—peaks when she reopens the scar “as if it too had waited,” a micro-choice that costs blood and memory. The final swallow of the osage seed converts wound into period, a credible renunciation that forecloses future self-harm. Voice remains singular, never sliding into diagnostic labels; emotional irrationality (laugh that hurts worse than silence) feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s yearning is viscerally anchored to the tactile ritual with the film; interiority stays specific (“fingertips tingled,” “voice rising through the rafters”). The final choice—to inscribe release and accept the looping letter—pays off the mother-shaped void without therapeutic gloss. Minor slip: “stored between heartbeats and perforated frames” flirts with poetic abstraction, but embodied cues elsewhere outweigh it.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dreamer’s interiority is unwaveringly concrete—every tactile interaction with the brass mount, every meteor-syllable she “hears,” is an embodied, idiosyncratic beat that externalizes her creative wound. Contradictory impulses (dread of forfeited dreams vs. pull toward cosmic inscription) are enacted simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final dissolution is earned: each prior micro-choice (loosening clamps, arranging parts into a self-constellation) visibly forecloses retreat, paying the cost of bodily extinction for the release of collective creativity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Guard’s stoic endurance and ritualized naming of children is vivid and embodied; the internal contradiction of “dreamless” yet caretaker of dreams is felt but never articulated. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choice to plant the clock face-down crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Cost is visible—coat lighter, pulse steady—yet the renunciation of personal timekeeper never quite hurts on the page, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The philosopher’s renunciation of the gear is credibly foreshadowed by her incremental unravelings; the distributed-self idea gives her a sharp, speculative interiority. Micro-choices (pressing gear to ear, syncing breath with jaguar, final kiss) are concrete and character-specific. Flaw: the “to rediscover” refrain edges toward thesis-statement, blunting full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    Marta’s interiority (“courage unused still exists within”) is over-articulated; the hound’s shift from bound-by-leash to bound-by-choice is externalized early yet lacks micro-choices that dramatize her agency. Jun’s “gently persistent” trait enables one visible beat (pressing the stamp) but otherwise remains label-not-action. The ensemble resolution feels choral rather than individuated; no guide faces a tangible forfeiture, so closure lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bellhop’s embodied grief and ritualized bolt-turning give him a sharp, specific interiority; his renunciation at the end—standing sentinel instead of speaking—carries visible cost. Motivation stays legible: every climb re-enacts the theft of voices and measures the price. The boy’s gaze tightens the crucible, but the bellhop’s own contradictory hunger for/terror of sound could be staged more brutally in-scene rather than recalled.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    The titan’s contradictory impulses—guardian precision vs. mercy that erases the usurper from memory—are shown in embodied micro-choices: climbing the carrel, whispering clues, letting the pellet hover. Each action reveals a hierarchy of values (balance > revenge) with visible cost: the choice to forget the man’s face, narrated as an active renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“voice calm as closed winter”), never diagnostic. The final moral calculus is earned because the pellet’s drift is first dramatized in the library gutters and then paid for on the pretender’s skin.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s grief-tempered vigilance feels lived-in; her need to “keep the station listening” supplies a persuasive through-line. Interiority is concrete—tears on a dive mask, salt-feathered paper—but the late pivot to hidden-reef destiny leans on summary (“she understood…”) rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The endurance stance at the end is credible, yet the story withholds a beat that shows her relinquishing an alternate future; we’re told she accepts memory-keeper duty rather than watching her hand let go.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is sensorially rich and tied to concrete action (bare soles tasting dust, sternum-hum). The “awkwardly confident” contradiction is shown only in the crane-balancing beat; earlier it is asserted. Motivation sharpens cleanly at the stone-pulse “Remember, Reclaim, Reignite,” propelling every subsequent choice. Earned cost is present—she leaves the planet without guarantee—but the decision’s emotional price is briefly summarized rather than embodied in a final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Nara’s contradictory impulses—obedient insurgent turned genetic saboteur—play out in embodied, orchid-coaxing micro-choices. The decision to nick the sac and rewrite destiny is earned by every prior limp, pollen sneeze, and volcanic tremor; cost is visible in her screaming knees and the guard’s drowsy rifle. Interiority stays concrete, particular, telepathic yet tactile. Flawed, stubborn, grandmotherly individuality radiates without label-speak or safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The interiority is searingly concrete—each plant mapped to a bodily hollow, resin pressed into scars—so grief is felt as corporeal geography. Micro-choices (snapping sea-lavender, pressing photo to bark) externalize the survivor’s guilt without therapy-speak; the final covenant to “live as the trees live” is earned because every somatic anchor has been dramatized. The only flaw is a hairline slide toward poetic label (“quietly talented”) used twice; it slightly abstracts what the body has already made brutally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s grief-propelled quest is visceral; every beat is filtered through his portraitist eye, so body, tool, and memory interlace. Interior contradiction peaks when he paints a “door only the drowning could open”—a credible, costly renunciation. The tarot scraps act as extension of his hand, giving concrete micro-choices under pressure; no stock therapy-speak, only salt-ink embodiment. Flaw: late switch from external relic-hunt to self-portrait feels one micro-beat under-supported, blunting full 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s serene anger and tracker skills are vivid, but his interiority is mostly declarative (“he understood then”) rather than embodied contradiction. Lyra exists only as theory and echo, so the sibling crucible never pressures a live choice. The final surrender is telegraphed, not wrestled—no micro-choice shows him abandoning the search for something else. Competence is asserted; struggle is offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sera’s contradictory impulses—obedient archivist vs. incendiary truth-teller—are alive in every beat; the thermal-sleeve concealment and pod re-entry are micro-choices that visibly cost her safety. The final smile under sedation crystallizes her earned stasis: she renounces personal survival to keep the archive honest. No stock phrases; even “bravely conflicted” is re-translated into bodily risk. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—she kneels, presses sand, hears roots—but the pacifist/bounty-hunter tension is told more than dramatized; no moment forces her to test that contradiction under visible cost. The final graft carries symbolic weight yet feels inevitable rather than a wrenching renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and sustained, earning high-band character presence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s cool-headedness is shown through embodied calm—bare feet, withheld pulse, silence as tool—rather than label. The rail-spike choice is a credible micro-act that crystallizes her values and costs her the safety of distance, earning the “Stay” echo. Internal contradiction is present but compressed; we see the second heart beat yet no crack in composure, so the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the stance shift is legible and character-specific, satisfying the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cordelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt for her father’s lies vs. her reflex to rewrite them—are dramatized in every inscription she makes on the dome; the broken nib and sunrise ink are visible cost. Motivation stays anchored to “stop the returning swing” of regret, and her micro-choices (loading photographic fixer ink, pressing until the nib snaps) foreclose the old orbit with felt price. The only bar to 9 is that the internal moment of forgiveness is slightly abstracted; we see the orbit crack, but her emotional surrender is implied rather than embodied in a final flush or tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interior contradictions—yearning for permanence yet destroying her art—are embodied in the tactile act of sweeping the mandala into a straight line; the final silent laugh crystallizes a credible renunciation. The chalk-dust tongue and lilac taste give sensory specificity, but the “socially perceptive” label is merely asserted, never tested by on-page interaction, so the trait stays decorative. Her choice to scatter the hush is clearly foreshadowed by earlier spirals and by the tile’s whisper, so the renunciation feels earned, yet the absence of any secondary character keeps relationship pressure off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Asha’s interior contradiction—her early universalism vs. the fire-hardened refusal to judge—is embodied in the tactile cataloguing of tesserae and the night-long placement of the forgetting-map. The renaming is dramatized: she lifts the cracked stepping stone and leaves, so the “Iron Cradle” identity is not merely asserted. Cost is visible: she forfeits home, reputation, and the archive dream. Yet the moment of transformation is slightly under-delayed; one extra beat of her hand on the cracked Judge-star before she pries it free would have pushed the earned change to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is sensorily vivid (“citrine applause, indigo silence”) and characterizes the ghost’s synesthetic craving, but his contradictory impulses remain static; he wants an encore yet never risks failure or alters tactics. Lila appears only to facilitate, not to challenge, so the relationship is mentor cameo rather than crucible. Micro-choices (tying thread, flipping coin) enact desire yet carry no visible trade-off; the bow feels pre-ordained, not costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her “affectionate skepticism toward inanimate objects” is lived in the first beats—and her micro-choices (grabbing the camera, tuning discs) are traceable to her drive. Contradictory impulses appear only in summary (“skepticism giving way to hope”) rather than simultaneous scene tension, and the final renunciation lacks a visible cost on the page. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and the embodied emotion is concrete enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aera’s lone-witness mission is vivid and embodied; her decision to “let the unknown speak through her” crystallizes an interior contradiction. The micro-choice to press the fossil to her sternum is a charged, irreversible act that costs her literal voice and former solitude. No second character appears, so relationship/status tests are N/A; the story still earns a credible renunciation. Flaw: the mentors’ “transitional object” tag drifts toward diagnostic-speak, blunting full-price immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is sensorily rich and embodied; the turner’s contradictory impulse—choosing to “unscramble” rather than accept the Abbott’s verdict—drives every beat. Micro-choices (laying out buttons, uncorking the jar, pocketing two keepsakes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The lack of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, but the protagonist’s self-confrontation sustains credible tension. The walrus-ivory / Bakelite pairing in the final image crystallizes a lived history of shed pain and child-chewing terror, earning her quiet renunciation of the tower’s sand-mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. last-shot redemption—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling despite the knee, crushing the pillbox). The final renunciation is fully earned: he forecloses any new identity and accepts visible erasure. Cost is scaled to length and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman’s interiority is richly embodied (“raw-knuckled hands,” “pulse warmed by his own pulse”) and his final acceptance of narrative collapse under the tongue carries visible cost. The girl remains a cipher, but since she is the personified promise rather than a secondary character, the single-POV default is preserved. The micro-choice to thread the fog with the needle crystallizes his hierarchy of values: stories over safety. The earned stasis—walking away carrying the droplet—feels inevitable because every sensory beat has primed his readiness to ferry himself.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lin’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on the leaf, the pulse-to-heat transfer—yet the “zen-minded” tag is never tested by contradiction; she glides from vision to act without visible internal drag. The clay hive choice is the single micro-choice that costs her nothing on the page, so the earned-stasis feels light. Still, her perceptual signature (kiln memory, soot maps) is specific and continuous, sustaining a magnetic, calm agency that just squeaks into the 9 corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—illicit rooftop gardening and tender mentorship—co-exist in every beat; the final renunciation of the stolen tooth is earned by her prior thefts of soil and sky, paid for with the literal fall of the rose petal and the lavender pressed into the boy’s palm.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gryphon’s loneliness-turned-cartography is embodied in every beat: the calcified crack, the refusal to let ghosts crowd her, the deliberate rotation of the sundial to engrave “Alone.” Interior contradiction is vivid (“brittle awakening” vs “resonant drum”), and the final choice costs her the chorus-of-ghosts comfort. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“translate isolation into independence”) that momentarily abstracts the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghostwriter’s interiority is lyrically specific—her hesitation chimes the pontoon, her laugh startles doves—but her contradictory impulses (to keep vs. release secrets) are summarized more than dramatized. The moment she presses palms to warm marble is embodied, yet the prior “years of forging hearts” is abstract back-story. The final recognition of her own heartbeat lands as earned because the causal thread of color-sentences circles her skin. Still, we never see her actually refuse or choose a concrete next act, only a lyrical exit, so the cost is felt but not fully incised.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her chest registers the town’s fracture as “subsonic tremor,” her lips taste copper during the counter-broadcast—but the “cosmic tricksters” remain an abstract antagonist, so her drive to “interfere” is more concept than contradictory impulse. The earned cost is present: she forfeits certainty, embraces chaos, and ends with “engine oil and ozone” on her skin, yet the moment of sacrifice is narrated rather than dramatized in a single visible beat. Still, her perceptual signature—charts as newspaper of possible futures—individualizes her and sustains pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arin’s claustrophobia is dramatized through humming sea-shanties and childhood breath-counting; the mirrored chamber forces her to confront every aged self, making the final ascent an earned renunciation of fear. The compass-point ritual and the decision to seal the tunnels are micro-choices that visibly cost her—claustrophobia is carried inside rather than cured. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse rattling like loose rolling stock”) and avoids diagnostic labels. One hairline slip: “wistfully necessary” is slightly abstract for peak beat, but contradictions hold and the closing stance is credibly paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Juniper’s face-blindness, methodical drive, and the micro-choice to cut her palm are tightly braided; the memory-revelation is earned via ribbon + blood, not declared. Interiority stays sensory: “hair drank the blood.” No diagnostic clichés. Cost is visible: plasma glues the ribbon to the page, foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s exile-choice is dramatized through tactile ritual (copper nail, kelp-stench) and a single micro-choice—asking Voss the bravery question—that flips her from passive decoder to active accuser. The “nervously confident” trait is embodied, not labeled, in trembling hands that clutch the nail while she steers the dirigible. Interior contradiction is alive: she both clings to ancestry and weaponizes it against the Ministry. The final choice to stay reverses exile on her own terms, a credible renunciation with visible cost ( etched coordinates on glass ) that forecloses return to the capital’s perfume.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fiddler’s contradictory impulses—cling to grief vs. risk belief—are dramatized in embodied bow-pressure and glass-flake heat; the final renunciation (crush/palm-dust) is earned by the father-memory and tarp-code causality. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that the hitchhiker remains a symbolic wire-frame; his lack of interior cost keeps the relationship crucible one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jonah’s contradictory impulses—clinging to static money yet craving forward motion—surface in the spiral ritual and the final gift; the renunciation costs him one irreplaceable note and lands as earned stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“soft as a moth wing,” “alphabetically… spelled a sentence”). Relationship with Mara is light but functions as crucible: mutual recognition alters both trajectories. Minor slip: “realized” paragraph edges toward summary epiphany, blunting simultaneous contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chronicler’s interiority is lyrical and consistent—her gift to “heal with words” is not abstract, it is dramatized when her spoken petal-syllables physically bloom into daylilies that lift grief off stone. The moment she recognizes the temple’s grief as her own insomnia is a earned, embodied epiphany that fuses flaw to vocation. The boy’s single tear naming her for the first time is a micro-choice that crystallizes their new shared burden, paying the visible cost of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Briar’s interior contradiction—needing confession yet clinging to secrecy—drives every beat; the seed’s bite and her kneeling “like a penitent soldier” embody cost. Her micro-choice to feed the seed her own blood crystallizes the war between self-preservation and guilt. No stock phrases; even “green would stay mine” is a singular greed. The final image of half-binding vines is a credible, charged endurance that forecloses return to innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically vivid but drifts toward self-mythologizing; the narrator’s “visions root deeper than fear” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse complicates the final surrender; the choice to graft feels pre-ordained by cosmic lyric rather than wrestled through flaws. Micro-choices (pressing fingers to scars, letting the maze drink) are present but lack visible cost until the final image; still, the silhouette-double stepping back supplies a credible enduring price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira’s “fiercely gentle” trait is embodied in her tactile apology to bones and her risky barter; the narrator’s surrender of the humming memory is motivated by wartime guilt and the explicit threat of widening soul-holes. Interior contradiction is present—he trades his only untouched memory yet immediately regrets the cost he sees Lira pay. However, the narrator’s pre-war self is sketched only through that one hum; we lack texture of how that loss alters his daily perception beyond “cool silence.” The earned cost is visible, but character depth is squeezed by word count, capping emotional granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mason’s contradictory impulses—clinging to past glory while craving new legitimacy—play out in embodied micro-choices (patching the mic, speaking the set-list). The final shift from souvenir hoarder to community listener is earned by the quarry echo that costs him his isolating nostalgia. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak even at peak beat. One notch off because the foreman’s entrance is slightly too convenient as relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s kindly methodical nature is dramatized in every beat: adjusting spectacles before stepping onto a humming void, mapping Morse-like clangs to cuneiform, kneeling to plant the seed with iron filings that stick “like frost.” The contradiction between scholarly composure and grief-raw need is embodied, not labeled; her laughter at the equation “love over time is velocity” is an earned, visible cost that forecloses the path of pure observer and makes her the bridge. Interiority stays character-specific—no therapy-speak—and the final endurance (stepping onto the new plank) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: archive over safety, love over absence. One hairline slip: “haunted ambitions” is named by the narrator, not Mira, but the phrase is immediately re-translated into lived pattern, so the flaw never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. release—are dramatized in the smelting ritual and the final promise; the hollow left by tomorrow’s absence is a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete (“gears ticking quietly,” “hollow adjust around absence”). Micro-choices (planting the creel, winding the ribbon) earn the Earned Stasis closure. Slight reserve: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets are N/A; interior arc alone carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat aches, the crown bites, she becomes porous—yielding a palpable before/after. Contradictory impulses (fear of living rooms vs hunger for connection) coexist in-scene and culminate in the crown-choice that roots her to stone. The confession “I inspect tombs because I am afraid...” crystallizes motive and flaw in one stroke, paying visible cost. Micro-choices (pressing pearl to wall, kneeling, speaking aloud) escalate under rising pressure, earning the final renunciation of her old vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—self-lacerating guilt vs. the need to chronicle—are enacted in every tactile choice: mapping sins on cartilage, kneeling to toilet-stall graffiti, stepping into the stream. The accordion’s surrender and the map’s re-draw form a visible, costly renunciation that only this specific wounded conscience could earn. No diagnostic self-talk; her lithium-withdrawn body is a vibrating instrument we feel, not a case study. Interiority is so concrete that “the river inside her kept speaking” feels like earned physiology, not metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation—voice stolen, prophecy bargain—drives every beat; the sewn mouth is embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (tracing cipher, removing thread) escalate stakes. Final dissolution into articulation is earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete: “lies becoming ballast,” “her scream carried backward.” No diagnostic self-talk; emotion shown via silk bleeding, watch weight. Fits 9+ quick test except closure’s causality leans allegorical; keeps 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. green-tinged mercy—are dramatized in the bow-tremble and ankle-roots; the final renunciation costs her the instrument and the empire’s summer, earned by prior telepathic coercion. Interiority is lush yet character-specific, avoiding label-speak. The “mulberry ache” embodies the stakes without abstraction. One hairline slip: the custodian’s ink-pupil trait is never leveraged again, a micro-drop in motive density.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic—her catalog of corpses’ final thoughts is a character-specific lens. The final dispersal is earned because every beat has shown her converting grief into cosmetic ritual; the cost is the literal dissolution of self. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, only recollection, so the arc rides one steady vector rather than twisting—still, the vector lands with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—knees “scallop inward” while she cradles absence—but the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is inferred not dramatized. Micro-choices (stabbing pin, pressing shell to sternum) carry cost, yet the decisive descent is slightly cushioned by cosmic scaffolding rather than raw flaw. Still, the hairpin relic and body-memory keep motive tethered to action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—absorbing guilt she refuses to feel—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands while decoding chimes embody the cost. The offer to let the geologist “stand naked with the truth” is a credible renunciation that springs from her accumulated fatigue and earns the story’s moral pivot. Only the “therapy-speak” drift in “protected vulnerability” keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s reverse-aging physiology and Marcus’s desperation are vivid, but the interior contradiction between her need to teach and her inevitable erasure is told more than embodied; the final fade lacks a micro-choice that costs her something we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cael’s interiority is lyrically specific—he “lets the patterns in a flock of birds…teach him what maps could not”—and his final stillness is seeded by childhood memory of water ripples, earning the renunciation. The arrowhead merge is the only overt micro-choice on-page; earlier beats are observational, so the arc leans accumulative rather than decision-heavy. Contradictory impulses appear more in imagery than in immediate action, slightly thinning the “under pressure” demand. Still, the closure’s cost (he becomes the echo, anchored forever) is scaled to lyric length and feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s underachiever status drives every beat: his failed cantrip, his badge-forfeiture, his embrace of “dim moments.” Interiority is concrete—fingertip pain, breath fog, laugh “small against the huge sky.” The final renunciation costs him credentials and safety, earned by prior causal chain; contradictory impulses (longing vs. metrics) stay active in-scene. No second character, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choice hierarchy visible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jin’s obsession with “the color of sound” is concrete and embodied; every underwater beat filters perception through that synesthetic lens. The renunciation—sealing the safe and surfacing—costs him the archive yet completes his spectrum, a credible Earned Stasis. Interiority stays particular, never sliding into label-speak. The woman vanishes too quickly to exert crucible pressure, so relationship dynamics remain off-stage, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s quietly enthusiastic fatalism is concrete: she palms coins, swallows metal, lies supine to let waves scour her nerves. Flaws compel the arc—her need to distill meaning overrides self-preservation—so the final surrender feels earned rather than symbolic. Interiority rarely slips into label-speak; even “stellar doubt” is rendered as a visceral chest contraction. The only minor gap: we glimpse no micro-choice that proves her reluctance to abandon the “lots decision maker” identity before she does.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s contradictory impulse—longing to name the fear he breeds—powers every beat; the plague-cot flashback crystallizes his guilt and the final paper-souls lift carries visible cost. No voice leakage; interiority stays bone-dry and specific to an immortal who has forgotten how to speak. The micro-choice to shatter the wax cylinders (freeing trapped voices) directly earns the absolving pulse he feels in his hollow chest. Flaw: late-arriving realization “every soul he reaped had paid…” is slightly abstract; still, the embodied ledger of initials on the atlas converts it to felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s “lukewarm” magic is embodied in the bell’s slow drip, his interiority stays concrete (“he held those griefs in his chest”), and his micro-choice to sit and count seconds visibly stakes devotion. The final renunciation—staying until death—earns its cost through prior causal chain (drip-rate doubling, community take-over). No contradictory impulses on-page; the single flaw is off-stage years that briefly tell rather than dramatize a shift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s interiority is concrete and anchored to sensory action—slipping on slime, pocketing the label, tearing the flakes. The contradictions are present: duty-bound warden vs. daughter revising her father’s myth. The micro-choice to photograph the town instead of hoard the past is earned and paid for in the moment she lets the blue scraps drift. Only the “mirrored hush” line flirts with abstraction rather than embodied thought, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s contradictory drives—logic versus reverence—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling to feel soil, flint strike, ribbon from mother’s dress). Her final act of melting the crystal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the orchard’s exhalation and the white-ink flock patterns flaring across her skin. The “secretly sentimental” trait, however, is told once rather than revealed through contradiction; that keeps it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is razor-sharp: every thought is filtered through her canopy-trained attention (“the rhythm of leaf and wind,” “soundless echo”). The contradictory drives—guard vs. release—play simultaneously in the penlight exchange and final buckle surrender. Muscle-memory detail turns the buckle into a physical lie-detector; the micro-choice to descend instead of drop it crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Older-self reveal could feel contrived, yet it lands because the story has primed pattern-recognition as her religion; meeting the pattern’s author is the only epiphany that could break her.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara/Zero’s shared origo is vividly particularized through the ego-death hollowing and the violet-taste memory; the synthesis woman’s final tear carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown, not told: her hand trembles while her psyche is hollow, and the later synesthetic child echoes both. Motivation pivots on the paradoxical creed and the custodial ritual, not external plot puppetry. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “emotional numbness” twice; otherwise embodiment is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—roots seeking “orthogonal angles of her architecture” literalizes her inventive mind—but her contradictory impulses (obedience to the seed vs. guardian instinct) are told more than dramatized. The final smile is a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than bodily or social, slightly under-weighting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ellery’s grief is rendered through embodied, specific action—cradling the blower, hearing the impossible giggle—so the interior contradiction is live. The micro-choice to throttle the engine gentler is a visible, costly pivot that earns the closure. No stock therapeutic self-talk; the flaw (clinging to noise) compounds until the tunnel gifts him a laughter he cannot keep. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he shoulders the machine and walks away, silence now stitched with after-laugh, cost felt in the frayed pull-cord pressed to glass.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The guardian’s shift from cataloguer to frost-laced sentinel is dramatized through her ritual of approach/retreat at the threshold; the final refusal to cross charges her stance with visible cost—she returns “wearing the expanded boundary…like a second fur.” Interior contradiction is alive in scene: she both longs for the pre-sleep plane of stable knowledge and protects the mutable garden that replaced it. Pendant negotiation and paw-print erasure are micro-choices that re-weight her identity without explanatory labels.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid—“stoically sensitive beneath soot-blackened goggles” shows embodied contradiction—but micro-choices are narrated rather than dramatized in the critical beat (offering goggles). The final renunciation is credible and forecloses sight, yet the emotional cost is asserted more than felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interpreter’s interiority is vivid—her micro-choices (pinning the star, unscrewing the hatch, feeding the shard) track her growing renunciation of assumptions and feed the closure. The contradiction between her professional mandate and the shard’s seductive silence is embodied in tingling fingertips and a lighter coat, showing cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV arc of turning silence into seed is complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.3)
    Arden’s interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic—his refusal to call the ferry “vanishing” but “slipping sideways” instantly reveals his coping logic. Micro-choices (tipping the hourglass twice, speaking barnacle numbers, reversing flow) track a hierarchy of values: save half-seen commuters at personal cost. Internal contradiction is live: hope vs. recognition that one timeline must die. Final laugh that ricochets multiplied shows embodied emotion under maximum pressure; the brass caps in pocket are earned relic of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fever dream architect’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers work the sinew, her calm stays unsettling—yet her contradictory impulses (creator vs. creation) remain asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat. The composite man functions as relationship crucible, but his dissolution is narrated more than felt, blunting the cost of her realization. Still, the “weight of being witnessed” lands as earned renunciation, foreclosing return to anonymous dreaming.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The instructor’s contradictory motives—grief for the surface and duty to the abyss—are embodied every time she fingers the rusted link. Her micro-choice to grind the fresh metallic face for the students crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The boy’s trembling question forces her to renounce comforting lies, and the cost is legible in the hollow ache she feels after surrendering the link. Their interiorities remain distinct, and the final Charged Poise of her back against the spire is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the dial, the illicit thrill of prying the scanner—while contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously. Motive intensifies cleanly: protect Lila’s voice → expose Hask → public credit. The final renunciation (letting the battery die) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is never named—only lived: the tunnel narrows to a throat, her knees bleed on glass, her breathing is timed to tide. Each technician she names costs gold lacquer and re-embodies them, so her motive (“stand by the unremembered”) is enacted, not declared. The moment she speaks “L. Sato,” the story pivots; the cost is the lacquer thinning, a visible, irrevocable price. Interior contradiction holds to the end: she fears enclosed space yet keeps crawling deeper, until the final ebb replaces fear with obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s contradictory state—alive only by clerical error—creates a compelling internal fracture that drives every beat; embodied emotions (“static crackles down my spine, reassembling blood”) keep the digital-ghost premise tactile. Micro-choices (tilting the shard, slicing the digital film) visibly enact the refusal to flatline, tying the interior conflict to physical risk. The final gift to the sobbing clerk crystallizes a moral stance that costs him daylight exposure, earning the renunciation. Flaw: heartbeat count is asserted more than felt in the body; still, the count’s sheer persistence supplies a memorable obsessive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s interiority is vivid—her fear of silence over death drives every micro-choice. The calcification sequence embodies contradiction: life slows into fossil meter while language accelerates. Swallowing the diamond is a crystallized value hierarchy made flesh. Cost is literalized in petrification; the path is foreclosed with statuesque finality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood nickname surfacing through static, the spiral bruise she can’t recall—but her contradictory impulses (scientist vs. willing sacrifice) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final metamorphosis is accepted without visible micro-choice that costs her a human path.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and idiosyncratic—“glass parted like water,” “heartbeat of a world learning to break free”—but the arc is a single, tide-like swell rather than a hierarchy of contradictory impulses. The renunciation (seed left on railing) is legible and earned, yet the emotional cost is diffused across metaphor rather than dramatized in body or voice. No secondary character on page, so relational crucible waived; micro-choices (skipping every fourth beat, kneeling to plunge fingers into glass) are concrete and tie motive to mythic task.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Riven’s interior contradiction—obedient courier vs. clandestine promise-healer—drives every beat; the “respectfully rebellious” stance is shown through micro-choices (storm-drop, key-feed) rather than labels. Embodied emotion is vivid (“letters pressed against his ribs”). Final renunciation—trading storm for letters—pays prior causality and carries felt cost. Missing top-band only because mother remains off-page, slightly muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The carpenter’s interior contradiction—scepticism versus need—is dramatised in the moment he touches the fragment; the ache in his throat and the wooden horses’ impossible neigh embody embodied emotion. Micro-choices (kneeling, singing in memory, stepping onto the mirrored pool) expose a hierarchy of values where reclaimed wonder outweighs physical safety. The Earned Stasis is fully paid: he walks away carrying irreversible internal music, leaving carousel notes spinning in dirt—a visible, felt cost. No stock phrasing; every trait emerges through sanding-rough sensory memory.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ms. Penumbra’s “sanely eccentric” interiority is textured through obsessive cataloguing and tactile scarf-memory, but the climactic insight—“she was the observer who collapsed the wave function”—is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. The scarf’s analog memories generate embodied micro-choices (tracing spines, warmth flashes) that foreshadow her role, yet the final collapse into meta-observer feels intellectually neat rather than a painful foreclosure of her previous human scale. Still, contradiction is present and sustained: order-seeking woman embracing infinite curvature. No label-speak in peak beats; voice stays particular.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mireya’s contradictory hunger—private yet communal—drives every beat: she bargains an unnamed memory for the horizon shot, steps into tide despite hollowness, and accepts palette-cracking saturation as fair price. The cipher’s inscription across her veins is the earned cost that forecloses any return to prior silence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses are vivid—the locksmith both nurtures and muzzles the idea; the final renunciation (“I am no longer the locksmith…”) is earned by the DNA-passport beat and the swallowed-ink transformation. Micro-choices (winding the ribbon, slicing the mirror-air) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The scar-as-tuning-string keeps visible cost alive. Only minor emotional label creep (“improbable longing” repeated) prevents 9—still, interiority stays embodied and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—offering memories to the tide, then reclaiming them—plays out in embodied beats (scalpel vs. sextant). The final renunciation carries palpable cost: she caps the vial, not the mushroom, foreclosing forgetting. Curiosity-as-flaw complicates every beat; her trembling gloved hand shows genuine struggle, not diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and particular (walking backwards, shard-coat glints), but the mentor’s erased name arrives too late to shape her prior choices, so the renunciation feels half-earned. The child’s instant grasp of the ritual is charming yet thin; no contradictory impulse complicates their fusion. Still, Lira’s micro-choices (seven backward circuits, spit in dust) visibly cost her the last escape hatch, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interiority is lyric rather than concrete; his contradictory impulses (keep vs share color) are announced, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is earned by causal chain, but emotional cost is rendered in elevated collective diction rather than embodied beat. Grandmother memory and taste-of-seed are vivid, yet压力下 self-diagnosis (“he understood then”) drifts toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“fracture lines like fault lines in his own chest”), micro-choices (each knot untied) track under rising pressure, and the final renunciation—“broken things… let the light through”—is earned via the causal chain of unraveling. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; he moves from task to task with single-minded competence, so the shift feels therapeutic rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and sensorially grounded; her “calm lantern” curiosity flickers under pressure, showing believable contradiction. The moment she presses her palm to stone and feels “a hush that curled inside her ribs” embodies motive through visceral action. Yet the arc is essentially contemplative; no external choice after the threshold walk carries visible cost, so the renunciation feels gently rather than wrenchingly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to data to master surrender—surfaces in her trembling gloved hand and the final line she writes; the “quietly analytic” trait is lived, not labeled. Her micro-choice to crack the globe and let the brine in materializes the stake of release with irreplaceable specificity. Death/Elias functions less as a second character than as an externalized facet of her psyche, so relationship pressure is minimal but not needed. The earned renunciation lands with visible cost: she surfaces “irrevocably lighter,” a weight we have felt in every salt-stung breath.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lyra’s contradictory impulse—preserve vs. release—drives every beat; the bolt-plate empties, the echo dissolves, and the cost (her voice now communal property) is legible. Interiority stays embodied in ozone-taste and copper hum. The only slip: “tasting metal” edges diagnostic-speak, blunting full embodiment at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—servile compliance vs. insurgent curiosity—are dramatized in every micro-choice (polishing goggles, tracing cipher, trading thimble for ash). The goggles warm against her cheeks, a visceral emblem of embodied emotion that never drifts into label-speak. Her final refusal to ascend again is earned by the prior beat of planting the seed; the cost is visible in her staying below, roots and branches.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s inherited obsession with emotional clouds is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—threading the filament, releasing kites—so her quiet-explosive resolve feels internally earned. The grandmother’s dent, the mother’s ridicule, and her own sky-log entries layer contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mourner) without tidy psychologizing. The final float is a credible renunciation: she pays with her life to keep the memories airborne, foreclosing any return to Earth. Only the absence of on-stage opposition keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The artist’s prosopagnosia is not just named but operational: it dictates what she paints (negative space, not faces) and why the guild trusts her. The interior contradiction—she can render perfect likenesses yet cannot recognize them—drives every micro-choice from pigment mixing to the final braille of stars. Cost is legible: she walks out carrying only brushes, having traded her last sanctuary for an invisible sky she will never see whole. The only bar to 9-band is a slight over-articulation of insight (“her limitation is not failure but filter”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s curiosity is embodied in dust-breath and knee-scrapes; the spiral translation is a micro-choice that costs her isolation and earns communal light. Contradictory impulses—yearning for discovery vs fear of erasure—coexist in the same beat. The final shared horizon is earned by her voiced tale, not authorial gift. One hairline slip: “knees shook” is a stock tell amid otherwise vivid embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation to "learn the rhythm of repair" is steadily dramatized via sensory micro-choices (testing gears, aligning key with reflection). Interior contradiction—grief for mentor vs. hunger for mastery—fuels final step into workshop; cost is the vanished return door. Earned Stasis satisfies closure. Minor gap: mentor relationship summarized, not embodied in scene, blunting highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s transparent, chill-based agency is consistent and emotionally embodied; her need to be trusted drives every beat. The colonists remain lightly sketched, but their shift from quarrel to collective rope-chain is shown through concrete action (barefoot Kai, coffee aroma, ladder choreography). Interior contradiction is limited—Mara never doubts her own altruism—so the arc is stabilizing rather than transformative for her, satisfying Earned Stasis, yet the living ensemble’s micro-choices do carry visible cost (swaying over cloud, grandparents anchoring with stories). Voice convergence at the communal level reads intentional, not flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The adjuster’s contradictory impulses—duty to the Council vs. ache for the puppet—collide inside each lullaby iteration; embodied in cracked lips against splintered wood, the choice to stay and erode is earned by every prior cradle she rocked. The broken puppet’s milky eye asking if salvation is worth finishing the song crystallizes the cost on-page. No stock labels; interiority stays concrete, trembling fingers, iron-taste acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s reluctant endurance is etched into every gesture—clenching the nut, hating the orchard, pocketing the sharp shell halves—so the final renunciation feels pre-paid. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. hatred) coil inside a single continuous scene, culminating in the costly hand-print constellation that forecloses her own escape. Micro-choices (spitting kernel, smearing mash, counting heartbeats) reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only hairline slip: “graceless beauty” is named once, not quite earned through embodied cost alone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority—her polymer-eye read of river foam as “fleeting grammar,” the calculus of casting absence into resin—remains concrete and particular; every beat of her grief is filtered through professional perception, grounding emotion in sensory action. The contradiction between cleanroom perfectionism and the messy theft of ashes by wind is dramatized, not stated, so her later atonement feels inevitable. Micro-choices (pressing chrysalis to ear, tuning resin to 440 Hz, walking away pockets-empty) reveal a hierarchy where relational repair outweighs scientific acclaim. Only the final ridge-walk edges toward performed epiphany; a hairline slip keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vendor’s interior contradiction—selling absences while secretly craving her own erasure—surfaces in the moment she drinks moonlight and becomes a door; the embodied cost (her vanishing) is legible. Micro-choices (pricing in “seconds of unlived time,” corking the librarian’s memory) reveal a hierarchy of values that tightens to the self-negating climax. The ledger-mirrors that erase buyers’ reflections store white-space hum as permanent, felt price. Voice stays singular, but the lack of secondary pressure keeps her arc just shy of crucible heat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—Marisol’s synesthetic curse is shown through bodily taste of stone and grief, never labeled. Contradictory impulses (erase vs. honor memory) coexist in-scene and drive the climax. The final reversal—she gives her own memories into the coral—pays off an earlier hinted hunger and costs her the old absolutism of her gift. Micro-choices (kneeling, palm-flat surrender) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mireya’s empathetic decisiveness is concrete and embodied in the sequence with the elevator and the languages she braids; her internal contradiction is quietly present (bridging vs. exhaustion). Her micro-choice to promise “restitution” to the elevator and the physical act of re-hanging the pine-cone weight visibly foreclose paths and carry cost (4:43 a.m. fatigue, metallic dust on apron). The only drawback is that the choral gift is asserted more than heard—no actual sung notes mid-scene—so the “harmonious” trait edges toward label. Still, the final palm-to-wall moment gives a believable Earned Stasis that re-balances tower, town and self.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic sense of “splinters tugging at synapses” embodies the chaotically precise motif—but the decisive moment of helmet-donning is slightly under-motivated; we’re told she’ll “amplify the resonance,” not shown why tonight’s moon angle is her last window. The sketches she pockets supply a tangible cost, yet the emotional renunciation (what path is foreclosed?) remains implicit rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ilyra’s single-minded quest is vivid, but interiority is filtered through lush world-detail rather than embodied contradiction; the doodle’s cooling is the only moment we feel her body decide. No conflicting want vs fear is staged on the page, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly. Still, her micro-choices (splitting perception along indigo, modulating whisper) track a clear hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ilay’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her paint-stained fingertips, the way she “breathes with that pulse” to match arboreal time. Motivation is clear and intensifies: silence must be answered before the grove forgets. Micro-choices (listening to cracks, strumming the insulator) visibly reveal her hierarchy of values and artistic discipline. Final stance-crystallization—the bow and pocketing of the dulcimer—is earned and quietly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The exiled tutor’s interiority is rich—his thumb eroding the basalt dent shows embodied anxiety and patience—but the promised “one final student” never materializes on the page, so the motivational arc stalls one beat short of visible cost. His shift from victim to would-be mentor is legible yet un-tested; the smile is earned but not paid for in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mirelle’s pacifist-velvet-coat iconography is vivid, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized; the final “broadcasting” renunciation is earned yet telegraphed in self-mythologizing tone that slightly softens felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Myrrh’s olfactory sensitivity and quiet ambition are concretely embodied in the seed-on-cheek test and the silk stitch; her shift from “astonish the village” to humbled gratitude is earned through the tree’s stillness. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—yet the mother–daughter breath-exchange is so understated that status and relational change feel implied rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Aera’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. self-preservation) act in-scene under inverted gravity. The arrow-tip micro-choices reveal her hierarchy of values and foreclose the path of detached observation with visible cost—she grafts her memories into the collective. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment stays sensorial (“vibrate like a tuning fork,” “calm into her veins”). Earned stasis lands cleanly: she accepts perpetual guardianship, arrow glowing as perpetual reminder.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tallying of wind-vectors, the tactile pulse of the stolen patch—yet her contradictory impulse (to listen to a future the port rehearse) is declared more than dramatized. One clear micro-choice—writing backward on glass—crystallizes her stance, but the emotional cost registers as conceptual rather than visceral. The single-POV isolation fits the port’s hush and the story’s design, so relationship/status criteria are waived. Motivation stays consistent; competence is balanced by the surreal limit of “listening to tomorrow,” keeping her convincingly fallible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is sensorially embodied (violet footfalls, cider harmony) and his micro-choice to swallow the sheet crystallizes the arc with visible cost; the absence of any second character keeps relationship/status bullets dormant, but the contradiction between Council utility and personal wonder is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation is earned because the aurora walk strips him first—no tidy calibration. Minor slip: “wonder needed certification” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but it is quickly grounded in the Council threat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s interiority is dense, embodied, and contradictory—her lungs “felt like catacombs” while she breathes silence, fusing relic-keeper competence with self-interrogation. The micro-choice to lay the flute on the spiral, not play it, crystallizes a hierarchy of values (insight > redemption) with visible forfeit. Backstory is woven through sensory cues (salt-smooth driftwood, ash-wind memory) that tilt present stance; no diagnostic labels intrude. The flaw—hubris masked as certainty—compounds until renunciation is the only credible exit; cost is scaled to length and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Quince’s contradictory hunger for borrowed selves and the ache of relinquishing them is dramatized in every beat; the final blank-paper print is a physical renunciation paid for by the prior erosion of his own lattice, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s jittery nature is embodied early (“jittery hands,” “jittery waltz”) and converts into trembling awe at the climax; the interior contradiction between fear and wonder is kept alive in-scene. Micro-choices—tightening grip, stepping forward—track the rising stakes. Missing: a clearer cost for his transformation; the fade from courier to legend is declared more than felt, keeping him just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—the scholar’s need for proof versus the bereaved’s refusal to relinquish—are staged inside every beat; the prism grows warm against the lie, the car shivers at the memory of her laughter, and the fracture that appears in the glass is the exact cost of admitting “I need you still.” Interiority never drifts into label-speak; grief is read as frost-braille, not psychology. The micro-choices (kneeling, scraping the circle, leaving the prism) accumulate into a credible renunciation whose price is legible in the clouded glass and the fracture inside him. The only bar to 9.0 is that the sister remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is memory-only; the story still earns its high-band under Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, tactile, and consistently filtered through the spinner’s fingers, loom, and orchard memory; the choice to swallow the amber and surrender voice is a credible, embodied renunciation that costs her speech forever. Micro-choices—picking up the box, fitting pieces, crushing the bead—track a clear hierarchy of values: message over self. The only slight drag is that the “wistful” tag is more atmospheric than dramatized contradiction; still, stoic endurance is shown, not labeled, in the final silent weaving. Earned Stasis is fully achieved, and the muteness is an irreversible price that shapes the orchard’s rewound clock.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Thistle’s quiet determination is shown through embodied action—every ladder rung is a micro-choice that costs him old identity. The “bartered awakening” confusion is dramatized in-scene (touching silk, descending shafts) rather than diagnosed. His flaw (meekness) visibly complicates the climb: he pauses, trembles, yet keeps ascending. Final renunciation of the forge is earned by the prior causal chain; the cost is the cold forge left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    The sensory map maker’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers itch, her soles record temperature, her gut swallows the data cube. Contradictory impulses (yearning to map vs. dread of complicity) are alive in scene, but the final resolve to redirect every future commission is asserted more than dramatized; we witness the insight, not the micro-choice that seals it. The lover’s absence is felt weight, yet the self-betrayal angle is revealed so late that the emotional cost is more inferred than tasted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific, earning a strong if not flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s reticence and ritualized micro-choices (adding the fourth stone, bottling the glass) embody a credible, long-creased interior contradiction—endurance as refusal to abandon. Embodied emotion is sharp: the “salt-ghost” he tastes, the green warmth traveling “to the bone.” The final row-back is Earned Stasis: he keeps the chain unbroken, pays with the ache of perpetual return. No therapy-speak, no label drift; every gesture is vocation-specific and costs him time/aloneness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—“porcelain echo that sliced the salt air”—and her contradictory impulse to both preserve and birth dawn is dramatized in the black-flame wick choice. The geas soldered to her laugh centuries earlier supplies credible inevitability, and her final barefoot stance on dew is earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: “accidentally prophetic” is asserted more than tested, but the laugh-shards do force costly star-erasure. Overall, motive scales from personal to cosmological without losing character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Hoshiko’s interiority is textured—dye-master perception, pulse-borne memories, porous self-concept—but her choices are observational rather than decisive. The climactic “new purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; no visible cost or irrevocable renunciation charges the turn. Still, the quiet-explosive heart creates a credible, embodied contradiction that sustains interest.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s quiet, methodical caretaker nature is vivid; her micro-choices (chalk grid, unscrewing brass, reading rings aloud) enact her need to mend what measures grief. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The final renunciation—quantify nothing—pays off her earlier indexing with felt cost: she forfeits the safety of numbers for the risk of listening. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The keeper’s amnesia and gradual self-reclamation drive every beat; her choice to drive shards into her ribs crystallizes identity under pain. Interiority stays embodied—“memories flutter like moths,” “sting of remembered joy”—without label-speak. The final refusal to speak her name is an earned renunciation that costs her mystery, capping growth. Micro-choices (press mica, exhale lullaby, alter song) consistently reveal value hierarchy: realm > self > pain.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “compassionate recluse” contradiction is shown through embodied micro-choices: kneeling to flatten the invitation against the floor rather than fleeing, letting the paper drink her pulse. The interiority is concrete and specific—her nerves “taste” borrower emotions, she “pours presence into paper”—with no diagnostic shorthand. The final vanishing is earned: her empathy mutates from burden to diffuse guardian, a renunciation that forecloses her bodily future and is visibly costed on the page. Flaw: the massacre backstory is asserted, not dramatized, so the guilt-driving flaw feels reported rather than lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mila’s interiority is concrete—“flour ghosts,” “bread-born herbs”—and her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. plant) act simultaneously in-scene. The micro-choice to bury rather than eat the loaf crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost: she swallows ordinary bread at the end, tasting tears. Competence balanced with genuine uncertainty keeps her from safeness; the only flaw is a faint therapeutic gloss in “she understood the sacred in the ordinary.”

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chief’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in every micro-action—glove adjustment, stylus scratch, tuning-fork strike—so her interiority feels lived-in. Her contradictory urge to quantify grief while surrendering to oblivion is shown, not told, and the final choice to liquefy the data into tree sap costs her the comfort of legacy. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are N/A; the solitary crucible works. The only flaw: a slight over-reliance on lyric summary in one middle paragraph flattens embodied pressure for ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The daughter’s contradictory want—simultaneously craving proof of betrayal while praying for Father’s arrival to stop her—drives every beat; the silver fob digs half-moons, her heartbeat trembles the wax, and the dawn hand-over crystallizes an earned renunciation that costs her the last illusion of paternal love. Interiority stays concrete ("lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love") rather than therapeutic, and the single on-page choice (hand opening at lavender sky) is causally seeded by the truce rule and her nightly vigil. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so relationship bullets are waived; head-count clarity is perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    The skeptic’s sensory weather-tasting and grandmother’s ring ground her; her shift from observer to weather-bearer is visible when the ring brands her palm. Contradictory tastes—ozone-lavender, spring-rain-winter-snow—embody inner conflict in real time. The final acceptance is earned: she pockets the seed and feels her own microclimate form, a cost of no longer being able to stand outside the weather. Voice stays coherent and particular; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is visceral—charcoal twitching in knuckles, taste of iron on tongue—while contradictory impulses (hide vs. complete, curse vs. gift) collide in-scene. The mother-daughter fusion is earned: the lock’s warm click and audible laugh pay the psychological cost of reopening trauma, making the final renunciation of sketching faces feel irreversible. Memory as both weapon and womb is lived, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurelia’s interior contradiction—her skin blistering at lies yet earning her living gilding them—grounds every move; the moment she trades gold foil for zinc fragments her hierarchy of values flips with visible cost. The archivist’s matching ache is sketched only in glances, but their shared renunciation of filtered speech crystallizes a relationship shift that feels earned. Micro-choices (slipping out before curfew, pressing the calfskin strip among unopened letters) keep agency taut. Only the absence of a deeper flaw or secondary pressure keeps this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tuner’s thirty-year silence, refusal to speak, and final wordless gifting of the wedge are embodied, costly choices. Interior contradiction pulses in the tension between her mute renunciation and the compulsion to keep wonder alive. The heart-sync moment crystallizes a credible, earned change: silence becomes the resonant cavity for future voices. No stock phrasing; every gesture is specific to this ascetic, acoustic vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    K-17’s contradictory caretaker code versus new-found longing is dramatized in-scene (opening servo-hum, final self-planting). The micro-choice to open the box and later merge it with its chassis shows a legible before/after with visible cost—loss of pure machine identity. Interiority stays concrete and bias-bound (“servos hummed with memory fragments,” “optical sensors” coated by memory-dust). No stock labels; the nostalgic ache is enacted, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s curator-drive is concrete from the first paragraph and steers every micro-choice—unlocking the gate, arranging finds, recruiting storytellers. The final refusal to open the box, letting the heartbeat fade into dawn, is a credible renunciation that costs her the “solution” the town expects. Interiority stays specific: dust between ribs, kettle steam, borescope’s metal eye. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so relationship bullets are N/A; headcount stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete—every beat is filtered through her dancer’s proprioception and decoder’s logic. Contradictory impulses (survive vs. swallow the seed) coexist in the same moment, embodied in the spiral she dances. The final renunciation—ingesting the data-page—costs her body and agency, fully earned. No label-speak; even “vulnerability is the hinge” is spoken through muscle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miren’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—pressing her palm to cold iron, kneeling to lay flowers on a salt-shadow—so the interior contradiction between mourning and mission is alive in scene. The final decision to scatter the dust and keep lighting lanterns earns its cost: she forecloses personal possession of the memories in exchange for diffused civic duty, visible in the steady flame despite trembling hands. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays coherent. The only drag is a hairline slide toward poetic diagnostic-speak (“she understood then that…”); still, the choice is causally grounded and carries felt ballast.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s interior contradiction—his need to erase prophecy while forever carrying it—is embodied in the swallowing of the sphere; the final smile shows cost. Micro-choices (pressing paper to sternum, stepping into brook, spoken “.”) all flow from his monastic vocation. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flaw and endurance stay specific to him; the cracked smile is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“I had agreed to teach her… knowing the bargain was one of those agreed-upon lies…”), and the micro-choice to accept the seal and interrogate the gargoyle is embodied. Yet the tutor’s transparency and vanishing are declared rather than felt, so the emotional cost of inheriting her role is asserted, not dramatized. The “patiently nimble” trait is shown in parables about cornices, but the narrator’s final shift to “new linguist” is more conceptual than a visible, costly renunciation. Still, the voice stays singular and the hierarchy of values—loneliness traded for custodianship—remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palms press the shell, her vision bleeds colour—contradictory impulses (sceptic vs believer, daughter vs public figure) coexist in-scene. The micro-choice to kneel, hum, and pay with colour-loss is earned and irreversible. The only drag is a faint “therapeutic” gloss on “isolation into independence,” but the body keeps the score so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s contradictory urges—vengeance versus self-forgiveness—are simultaneously alive in every beat; the micro-choice to write in her own shaky blood-script rather than her sister’s perfected hand crystallizes the shift. Interiority stays concrete (“the heritage rose thorn pricked her finger as she remembered”) instead of labeling emotion. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she walks out carrying nothing but the useless key and the knowledge that survival itself was the unpayable price. Flaws (survivor-guilt cruelty, perfectionism) directly shape the climax and are not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s contradictory pull—yearning to finish what her mother could not while fearing her own echo—grounds every beat; the final choice to dissolve the cocoon is earned by her sensory-embodied journey. Micro-choices (pressing shell to cocoon, singing the missing cadence) reveal value hierarchy: completion over clinging. Emotional cost is visceral when the canyon falls silent for the first time. No stock interiority; perception remains salt-and-bone specific.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marrow’s interiority is sensorily rich (“crevasse-blue ice”, “second heart”) and her stoic vocation holds; the smile at the end supplies a visible earned thaw. Yet her late decisions—lifting the intact globe, leaving the mirror—come almost gift-wrapped by the glacier rather than wrested through a prior contradiction we can feel. Micro-choices inside the shrine (palms sticking, candles lighting) are strong, but the peak beat feels guided by wonder more than by conflicted will.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The philosopher’s interior contradiction—mourning labor no poem will praise while insisting mending is conversation—remains embodied every beat; her spiral footwork externalizes it, and the final choice to store the whisk at her pulse shows earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s contrarian turn from state mouthpiece to truth-gravedigger is crisply signaled; her tactile micro-choices (humming the sign-off tone, threading the diamond on root-fiber) enact the shift with cost. Interiority stays sensorial—copper-shame, vacuum hush—rather than diagnostic. The final renunciation (hanging the stone) is earned because her hands already sting with its playback. Only the “amnesia everyone else scavenged” line drifts toward label-speak, blunting the edge a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to become the prophet while recoiling from self-erasure—are dramatized in the final hand-hover moment. The childhood flashback and the bomb memory give credible, specific roots to her variant allegiance. Interiority is embodied (“laughing gritty whimsy bubbling up like blood from a bitten tongue”) rather than labeled. Cost is legible: she dissolves into static, forfeiting corporeal life—an irreversible price earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Posy’s translator-mission is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to speak memories into the box is a visible cost. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic: “bones humming with the lonesome splendor.” Contradictory impulse—hoarding voices vs. giving them away—drives the climax. The child’s arrival is external pressure, but relationship shift is implied, not dramatized on page, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mireya’s interiority is palpably embodied (“salt, iron, whale song” tears), her contradictory calculus—save artifact vs. lose town—acts in-scene, and the final renunciation (key worn smooth) costs her the tool itself; the glacier-heartbeat sync is a micro-choice that re-weights her stance, though the “logically emotional” label is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s impatience-turned-patience is dramatized through embodied ritual (kneeling, breathing on pouch) and a final micro-choice to leave the compass; the “second heart” image is specific. Interiority stays concrete, but the litany edges toward therapeutic self-labeling (“I sculpt patience…”) and the elders remain off-page ciphers, so relationship/status crucible is absent. The earned renunciation lands with visible cost—he forfeits the compass and the coast clockwork—making the arc credible.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s contradictory motives—hunger for truth vs. recoiling from her own past—are dramatized in the tactile choice to keep walking despite the memory-hit at lantern-flicker; the final "small rebellion" of filing the full report is earned by that causal chain. One interior cliché ("hit like a train") and the late-arriving father-link slightly dilute the sense of prior inevitability, but the embodied tremor on finding the journal shows emotion in muscle, not label, satisfying the 9- test.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emil’s guilt-driven need to “turn apology into action” is viscerally embodied in the way he fingers the cracked heart and later surrenders the candle-fund money; the contradictory pull between pastoral comfort and complicity in state killing is kept alive in every beat. Rowan remains off-stage, yet the chaplain’s flash of remembered dialogue (“Amazing Grace” anecdote) gives the inmate a pulse that feeds Emil’s urgency. The final micro-choice—handing over the death-warrant list plus the repaired music box—pays off the interior knot with visible cost: dawn still comes, but Emil now stands “beside truth,” a stance that costs him institutional safety. Interiority stays concrete; only a sliver of diagnostic self-talk (“contrition without consequence is merely nostalgia”) slips toward aphorism, holding the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Juniper’s “steadily curious” smirk is embodied in every micro-choice; her refusal to kneel yet readiness to risk skin on acid-slick pontoons crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The arrow-tip-as-stylus turn dramatizes irreverent awe and cartographer precision in one beat. Internal contradiction is live: she mocks the quest even while pouring months into it. Final strike costs the tip its glassy edge—visible, irreversible, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s contradictory drives—obedience vs. filial memory—are dramatized in the crystal-block moment; the lullaby she sings while erasing herself embodies both cost and motive. Interiority stays concrete (“server farm’s chill still humming in her bones”) rather than abstract. The final choice to become a living archive is foreshadowed by the seven-year vigil and the mother hologram, so the self-erasure feels earned. Only the mother’s sudden appearance strains credibility—no prior hint she was aboard—so motivation stops just short of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—trained detachment vs. surging re-claimed empathy—drives every beat; the swallowed-crate moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final smile in the mirror is earned by the causal chain of glass-for-glass, crate-for-conscience. Minor slip: “heart unhidden” leans label, not embodied, but the prior physical toll (lost reflection, pier collapse) already paid the price. Sufficient for high band, not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—arriving to watch death, choosing to listen—drives every beat. The heirloom transfer to the boy crystallizes her earned renunciation; the frostbitten thumb on the chip is embodied cost. Secondary pressure (boy, elders) stays coherent, but their voices converge toward hers in the final choral moment, a hairline flattening. Grip-loosening trait is shown, not told, and directly enables the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marco’s interior contradiction—clinging to a 19-year-old scorch while inventing a cross-varietal graft—gains flesh through tactile beats: thumb on char, leaf-crush releasing “bruised herbs,” the decision to sleep with cinder under his pillow. The endurance (Earned Stasis) costs him the safety of accepted varietal borders and carries credible viticultural risk, satisfying the 9+ test even though Elena never appears onstage.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The walker’s scar-backstory micro-beat (last time he “failed to preserve wisdom”) gives interior contradiction and a micro-choice to keep the echo peripheral. Yet he remains largely a solemn archetype—no status friction, no visible flaw that complicates the ritual; the consecration proceeds exactly as intended. The ending replaces the mask without testing that choice under fresh pressure, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than re-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is richly embodied—breathing for bees, the silver key pressed like a baby tooth—yet her contradiction (collecting grief to “transmute” it) stays mostly lyrical assertion. A single micro-choice—pinning the belt-photo so the spiral aligns—shows agency, but later beats repeat the same gentle ritual rather than testing or evolving her motive. The final “masterpiece complete when shared” is lovely, but arrives as declarative uplift rather than a cost we watch her pay or forego. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

    Elara’s reticence is shown through marginal living and quiet testimony, not label-speak; her shift from cataloguing to witnessing is subtle but earned. The crystal’s pull on her is never psychologized, only acted upon—she pockets, listens, writes, smiles, leaves. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the interior conflict is implied rather than embodied in a single pressured micro-choice. Closure is a renunciation that costs her the library, but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally; still, enough specificity exists to keep her above stock “lonely scholar” trope.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prophet’s precognitive amnesia is dramatized through embodied ritual (chalk on palm, spiral of driftwood) rather than label-speak; his compulsive marking and relistening reveal a hierarchy of values—memory over safety, echo over future. The stance crystallizes in earned stasis: he accepts tomorrow’s erasure, pays the cost of perpetual re-search. Interiority stays concrete (“metallic on his tongue like the flavor of aging itself”). Only flaw: no contradiction between wants/needs is staged; the loop feels fated, not chosen under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is sensorily embodied (“luminous ache through cracked glass,” “blurred brass moth”); her micro-choice to aim the Hasselblad inward crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. The contradiction between fixing machines and accepting their collapse stays active in-scene, not abstract. Flaw: “escape velocity became a lullaby” drifts toward poetic label-speak; still, the final smile shows earned stasis. No orientation or causality break, so no cap.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinically serene yet privately haunted—are embodied in the way she presses the vinyl shard to Calderon’s pulse then to her own sternum; the micro-choice hierarchy is legible and the final renunciation (carry both pieces forward) carries unmistakable cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the “decisively kind” trait actively shapes her tactile decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s quietly deliberate nature is shown through her methodical winding of the key and her willingness to trade her own shadow; the interiority is concrete (“she whispered a new rune…”) and the final renunciation is earned. The flaw is that her contradictory impulses are told more than embodied—no moment where she visibly hesitates or her body betrays her. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: knowledge > personal wholeness, and the cost is felt when her shadow waves goodbye.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—believer in tea-and-forgiveness now fractured by the living corpse—grounds every beat; the opal tooth, the pear-fed soil, the changeling’s map all force micro-choices that visibly tilt her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (she stays silent at dawn, sleeves rolled to splint new falls) lands with cost and is earned by the trail of prior causal links; no diagnostic self-talk under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—knees ache, palm pulses, heartbeat timed to drip—showing embodied contradiction between longing and fear. The micro-choice to polish glass sunwise, whisper a constellation, then lift the pearl crystallizes her values under pressure. The earned cost is the pearl’s dissolution and her mother’s memory braided into the hush that settles on villagers; the quiet mirror she becomes is credible renunciation. Only minor slip: “weight settle inside her chest” edges toward diagnostic speak, but is immediately grounded in embodied tally of rooftop nights.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s “watchful dreamer” nature is asserted early and re-anchors the final beat, but interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the buried-USB choice is causally thin. Earned cost exists in the final image yet feels conceptual, not personally staked. Micro-choices under pressure are present (record, bury, leave) yet register as ritual rather than irreversible fork. Voice stays coherent, but emotional embodiment is more lyrically declared than body-felt.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her counting heartbeats, tasting salt on lashes, feeling the pianist’s chord in her ribs. The contradictory pull between hoarding fragments and releasing them is dramatized in the moment she lifts the shell back to the mist. Micro-choice at climax—offering the shell—earns the internal shift with visible cost (Lira’s dissolve, heat under sternum). Flaw: “lucidly watchful” is asserted twice rather than shown through perceptual tics; still, the final stance is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific tinkerer vs. ritual singer—are dramatized in simultaneous micro-choices: she calibrates goggles while humming off-key, feathers pollen with a phoenix quill whose warmth she feels. The daughter’s sickness is never abstracted into “motivation”; it surfaces mid-song as a catch in breath that cracks her highest note. Closure costs are embodied: the tendril dies in her palm, new vines already sprouting to prove the cycle will demand future sacrifices. Voice remains copper-and-grease specific; no therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is textured and embodied—pulse-counting, frost travel through wrists—without label-speak. Renunciation of escape (he “would never leave”) is foreshadowed by micro-choices: breath-matching, rip-free page lift; cost is felt in the throat hollow where her name lived. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets inactive. Single flaw: motive phrasing drifts toward abstraction (“translate heartbeats into maps”) in a couple of lines, slightly thinning the contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel’s quietly obsessive interiority is vivid—his peripherally focused attention becomes a believable cognitive tic that both enables and limits him. The renunciation of duplication at the end (“a key he would never duplicate”) crystallizes a cost, but the emotional turn is compressed into a single sentence; a sharper embodied beat at that moment would have locked 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The weaver’s interiority is granular—breath synced to sevenfold symmetry, finger cut by obsidian sheet—and her moment-to-moment choices (tilting the burner, confessing the sister cliff-memory) trace a credible arc from self-shielding to self-sacrifice. The flaw that cost her sister’s hand is seeded early in the “weights of different burdens” premise, so the final disclosure feels inevitable, not convenient. One decimal off perfection only because the sister’s forgiveness is shown through infinite reflections rather than a dramatized micro-gesture; still, the cost is embodied in the blood drop that flares the violet flame.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb tracing grain, sweeping shavings into labeled jars—so her interiority never drifts into label-speak. The contradiction between clinging and letting-go is held in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (hanging the latch, accepting rust-hued peace) is visibly foreclosed by every cut she has made. Hairline slip: “eyes closed in mercy or grief—she could no longer tell” edges toward explanatory abstraction, but the next sentence immediately re-grounds in sanding the photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scavenger’s contradictory drives—clinging to spin-memoried plastic yet breaking it—are dramatized in the final click-break beat, and the shared erosion pact carries visible cost. Interiority is sensory, not therapeutic; the camera wheel’s cracked vertebra line shows thought through tactile injury. Chronological confusion is embodied in backward-name hisses and three-second-delayed reflections, not explained. Only minor cap: the ghost’s hand-wave is a touch generic; more idiosyncratic gesture could have sealed full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alya’s stoic-wonder voice stays consistent; every weld-torch choice embodies her “functionally creative” trait. The pocketing of the warm sextant shard is a micro-cost that seals her arc. No contradictory interiority is shown, but the scarcity of external resistance keeps the arc emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s interior contradiction—yearning to stop time yet surrendering the attempt—remains vivid and embodied; the moment he lays the pendulum down is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “the weight had transferred into the stones” is felt, not labeled. Micro-choices (kneeling, opening the hatch, walking away) track a hierarchy of values with visible forfeiture. The only bar to 9+ is that the change, while earned, is single-note; no secondary flaw complicates or tests him further.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—glorifying a father she already half-doubts—plays out in tactile beats: the dented gnomon, the smudged log entry, the choice to beach the barge. Embodied emotion is vivid (“serene upheaval that always preceded revelation”), but the moment she reads the journals is summarized, not dramatized, softening the earned cost. The final renunciation (sundial left in the crate) is legible and weighted, yet we are told rather than shown her knees or lungs react. Still, micro-choices track cleanly up the escalation, and the moral ambiguity stays un-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ari’s interiority is richly embodied (“infinitely patient through forty winters”) and her micro-choice to crack the fulgurite seed on the dock plank is legible cost. The harbormaster is thin; he exists only as a bureaucratic foil, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Because the decisive action is solitary, the arc still earns a credible renunciation, but secondary-character pressure is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and metaphor-drunk, but every beat remains anchored to the concrete weft-thread micro-gesture; the final self-recognition (“she’d been her own first client”) is earned because the mirrored image was seeded in the first paragraph and paid for with seven years of accumulated absence. Emotional contradiction glows in the same sentence—ink-stained fingers trembling while she “crafted their deaths”—so we feel both art and guilt fused. The notebook’s emptiness at the end is a visible, costly relic of change. Slight over-articulation of epiphany (“understanding that…”) keeps it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prince’s interiority is gorgeously embodied—hanging upside-down to “let blood pound memory into his skull” fuses physical risk with cognitive obsession. Contradictory impulses (beauty vs. rust, theft vs. apology) coexist in-scene and drive every micro-choice. His final smile during the palace’s fall crystallizes an earned renunciation whose cost is the plunge itself. Voice remains singular, never sliding into abstraction or diagnostic talk.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory imperatives—honour the arsonist-father yet fight fire—are dramatized in every tactile micro-choice (mixing sand into dune soil, tying the coin, tapping her burn). Interiority stays embodied, never drifting into label-speak; the “private Morse” on her lava-rippled arm distills a life-time of training. The final refusal to keep bringing sand, and the promise of saplings, costs her the ritual she’s nursed since age seven; the cost is visible, earned. Voice remains singular, no occupational exposition dumps; firefighter competence is shown through poised gesture, not data.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her skepticism shows in testing the box’s weight and in the measured way she speaks to it at the end. The “liberation, not grief” motive drives every beat; each fountain stop is a micro-choice that dissolves a shard, visibly foreclosing the option to keep repressing. Contradictory impulses (yearn to forget vs. need to witness) play out in real time as she lifts, touches, opens. Cost is legible: the empty box is physically lighter, the sky re-animates—an earned stasis that accepts the family she cannot reclaim.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s desire to share light without fire is concrete and embodied; the gear-as-heirloom and the cracked beacon ground his motivation in tactile, repeated ritual. Interior contradiction arrives late but lands: “roots” vs “wave that carries the break” crystallizes a credible renunciation with cost. Micro-choices (tuning the gear, stepping off-path) are tied to ancestral fractures, so the final shift feels earned. Missing earlier interior conflict keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrically specific (“fiercely meditative” enacted through patient butterfly-watching), but the decisive change—choosing “gardens where grief can keep transforming” over carved stone—relies on ancestral exposition rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page; the grandmother-voice spells the insight instead of forcing the carver’s body to act against prior habit. Still, the ribbon warmth and dawn-time emergence give embodied cost, keeping her above the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The winder’s guilt-laden vocation and the brother’s ghost-field create a crucible of contradictory duty: keep the clock and the sea devours, stop it and the village’s time-economy collapses. Interiority is concrete—“searing reverie of salt and machine oil,” arms burning while winding—never abstract. The final act of lashing the rake handle to the pendulum is a micro-choice that externalizes the internal split and costs him the tower’s original tempo; the slowed beat is the embodied price. Only the villagers’ off-stage fear keeps this from a 9+: we never see one villager’s face crack under the new cadence, so the social cost is inferred rather than witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mercy’s interiority is concrete—her ribs flutter, her fingers tremble—yet the “blithe” trait is declared, not dramatized; she never contradicts it under pressure. The final descent is earned because every prior beat of tending and decoding has foreclosed her old identity as mere gardener. Still, the coin’s warmth is the only external test of motive; a second, costlier temptation would have sharpened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cartographer’s interior contradiction—surrendering memory to write futures—drives every beat; the costly amnesia is embodied in her whitening fingertip and the dissolving quill. Motivation escalates from abstract quest to visceral self-erasure, culminating in the earned stasis of her body folding into the blank page. No head-count or status issues; single-POV focus is razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mila’s fixation on cloaking narrative inside notation is vivid and embodied; her nightly micro-rituals (rosin-ink, copper filament weaving) show hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she “copies silence,” “trusts only green phosphor”—avoiding label-speak. Yet her decisive moment (pressing transmit) is under-motivated: no visible contradiction or flaw is tested, so the cost feels external rather than character-rooted. Earned stasis is present but wan—she smiles at whispering dust, a coda not a wound.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to finish the ritual—are embodied in the charcoal-smeared fingers that keep scattering powder while the mask fractures her reflection. The rocking chair’s stilling is a credible renunciation that costs her the last living link to the stories, yet the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract “safety is a mirage” commentary rather than Sensory-specific ache. Micro-choices (angle of the chair, alignment of the largest shard with her eye) reveal a hierarchy of values, but the grandmother remains off-page voice-mail; no live status shift with a second character, so relationship crucible is waived. Still, the flaw-driven mistake is visible: she keeps grinding truth into powder until the only story left is dust.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Caldera’s “rationally rebellious” stance is vividly embodied—refusing vaccines, tasting sewage, diving for ledgers—so her philosophy is never abstract. The femur-cog stylus is a haunting micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary; we are told she “agonized” rather than watching the gear-turn of thought under rising pressure. Still, the final public pronouncement lands as earned renunciation with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—her palms “open as though waiting for sound to settle,” her lips pressed to the rosette—so her decision to offer her own voice as “sacrifice” is embodied, not declared. The contradiction between wanting to restore harmony and needing to erase herself to do it plays out in real time; the rosette’s diminishing reflection of her scale makes the cost audible. Her flaw—believing she must nullify herself to heal the city—drives the climactic renunciation and forecloses any future song from her, a loss the ending braids into the town’s new quiet. The only minor drag is the abstract phrase “expectantly resigned,” which momentarily coats her in thesis-speak until the gesture work reclaims specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marisol’s contradictory impulses—reckless theft of the seed versus tender, surgical care—play out in real time through embodied micro-choices (tongue on glass, drop of blood) that charge the final image. Her motivation escalates from private reclamation to collective rewiring, the cost visible in the Ministry seeds now in every officer’s pocket—she has seeded her own surveillance. Interiority remains chef-particular, never sliding into label-speak; even “synaptic plasticity” is tasted, not lectured. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: she forecloses safety, embracing perpetual rebellion seasoned with self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—preserve wonder inside routine—drives every beat; her lie to the sky is an earned inversion of her cursed honesty, paid in copper-coin orbit. Interiority is sensorily anchored (ozone, nectar dusk, sulfur) and morally specific. The climactic renunciation (gate left open) carries visible cost: she forfeits her toll-gatherer identity and regulatory safety. Flaw is active: her romantic need to protect wonder blinds her to personal peril, compounding risk up the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s vocation is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—pressing the orris shard, collecting un-missed fragments, kneeling to the compass—each exposing her hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority remains sensorial (“violet scent grounding her”) rather than diagnostic, and her final refusal to take the needle shows credible renunciation with cost. The only minor drag is the late label “keeper of the almost-unseen,” a touch explanatory, but it lands outside the closure beat and does not undercut the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alabaster sentinel’s interior contradiction—stone yet newly sentient—drives every beat; telepathic bloom and the gardener’s braided presence externalize conflicted values. Choices (cradle ampoule, glide, crack) are traceable to the awakened hunger for nuance, and the softening to “possibility” lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the wave to guards feels narrated rather than embodied, keeping this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly concrete—rolling the dice until the chipped one balances on its missing corner embodies her mathematician’s obsession with asymmetry and regret. The contradiction between grim realism and stubborn optimism drives every micro-choice (leaping primes, smearing blood in sigma). Final refusal to step through the ripple costs her the escape she craved, earning Earned Stasis with visible palm-cut price. Only slight abstraction in “ghost-weight of a hand” keeps this from 9-land.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s insomnia, painter’s eye, and compulsive outreach to erased languages are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the moment she cedes agency to the brush her interiority stays coherent and the final exhaustion is earned. Secondary pressure from Jules lands as credible witness rather than relational crucible, so the highest 9+ band remains just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelia’s shift from cataloguer to co-maker is dramatized through her fingers learning dough, not declared; the Chen grandmother’s pushback supplies external pressure that forces the change. Interiority stays concrete—opera glass weight, flour like frost—without diagnostic labels. One beat of micro-choice (she sets down the lens and picks up dough) crystallizes the cost: she forfeits her detached stance. The earned renunciation is legible and scaled to the length; only the beekeeper’s absence feels slightly convenient rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The maker’s self-contradiction—yearning to escape death yet feeding the stone with dread—is dramatized in every micro-choice; cutting the string and accepting normal time costs him his gift, a price legible on the page. Interiority is concrete (“latent radiance now a visible ember eating the string”), never label-speak. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; the crucible is self vs. time. The final smile and whispered thanks show earned endurance with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interiority is vivid and embodied—"clutched the opera cloak clasp… the only thing that still held heat" shows need through action. The whispering advisor gives a second, contradictory impulse in-scene, satisfying the 9+ test. The final kneel and gift of the clasp crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the advisor’s voice never acquires physical consequence, so the relationship crucible stays one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prophet’s interiority is concrete and embodied—he “pressed an ear to the wind,” “sketched resonance,” “listened”—and his contradictory impulse to convert danger into music drives every beat. No secondary characters exert pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; his micro-choices (strike barrel, rig bamboo crown, summon crew) escalate stakes and visibly cost him calm. The final endurance—standing silent, absorbing the raft’s new heartbeat—is earned stasis that forecloses retreat. Voice stays singular, never drifts into label-speak; flaw is purely solitary obsession, fully accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses—duty to map vs. terror of what mapping may cost—pulse in every beat; the cracked note is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses safety and earns the final vision of her mother. Interiority is sensory, ink-stained, coral-collared, never diagnostic. The whistle’s fall and the city’s subsonic turn carry the cost on the page. Quiet endurance becomes a charged stance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally grounded; the childhood memory flashback gives concrete stakes. Interiority is vivid—"felt the seductive pull of Rowan’s original intent"—but the “emotionally rational” label is asserted more than dramatized in the moment. The final choice (leap and escape) is visibly costly, yet the beat compresses her competing impulses into one sentence. Overall a strong, specific arc; only the peak beat needs sharper contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—certifying structural safety while secretly entombing private griefs—are dramatized in every mortar scrape; the stoically sensitive trait costs her bodily heat and civic trust, earning the renunciation of ever sending the letters. Micro-choice hierarchy is vivid: ink before paper, confession before comfort, archive before air. The closure palm-press against “I am here to mourn” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible heat transfer. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; interiority remains concrete, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s indexing obsession drives every beat; her tactile re-ordering of bruised cards is embodied, urgent, and stakes her body in rising water. Interiority stays concrete—“the mark listened to her pulse and found it wanting”—without label-speak. The final decision to remember is earned by prior discoveries and costs her the safety of official history. No secondary character on page, so crucible and status dynamics N/A; head-count clarity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—kerosene scent, glowing ribs, translucent grief—yet the mother’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release the dream) are shown more than tested; the micro-choice to light the leaf-chimney crystallizes endurance, but the cost feels slightly under-felt because the daughter remains silhouette, not remembered flaw. Still, the craftsperson’s lens is specific, and the renunciation lands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The survivor’s grief-driven obsession is viscerally embodied through the geode’s weight and the telescope hunt; every micro-choice (smashing the breaker, stepping onto the rail) is credibly compelled by loss. Interior contradiction—savior vs grave-robber—survives the lyric compression. The final renunciation costs his life and is earned by the prior cascade of harvested futures.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s longing is visceral, but her interiority slips into paraphrase (“the rhythm of belonging she’d sought”) rather than contradiction under pressure. The pilgrim’s eyes register surprise yet never complicate his calm, so status tension stays flat. Closure choice—folding the star-map and turning skyward—feels inevitable yet abstract; the emotional cost is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt is palpable through the brass watch hand carving his palm and the visceral alley vomit; the contradictory drives—manufacturing lies vs. needing to confess—co-exist in-scene. The micro-choice to place the watch hand in his mother’s palm crystallizes a value hierarchy (truth > self-protection) with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final forgiveness risks neatness, but the mother’s prior knowledge and Elias’s recognition that “time…never truly lost” keep the arc credibly weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s interiority—anchored in the tactile memory of the brass pull and his winter moon-charting—shows contradictions (duty vs. guilt) that tighten on the parapet. His micro-choice to hand Seris the gloves, then the pull, crystallizes a hierarchy of values (restoration > victory). The moment he hums the lullaby, borrowing a tune from a smuggled letter, embodies embodied, cost-carrying empathy. Closure: he descends palms-empty, weight transmuted under ribs—earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory pull between dead charts and live water is dramatized in every paddle stroke; the compass gash baptizes her so the choice to keep paddling emerges from body-level cost, not lecture. Interiority stays salty and specific—no psych labels, only marrow listening to marrow. 9.0+ gate met: contradictory impulses act in scene and renunciation of old navigation is paid with the cracked glass still leaking cold water.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seeker’s contradictory desire to remember in order to forgive powers every beat; his choice to wade into the lake is earned by the baseball’s orbit and the visceral nausea of returning harm. Interiority is concrete—“shoes filling with cold fire,” “bones like paper lanterns”—never abstract. The single flaw: the silhouettes on the far shore arrive late and remain ensemble symbols rather than crucible characters, so status dynamics stay theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sister-bond motivation is vivid and embodied (branded lip, saffron-honey taste), but the “beast whisperer” identity is asserted rather than dramatized—no beasts are meaningfully persuaded or refused, so the title feels ornamental. Interior contradiction is present yet stays lyric-summarized (“I fought the change”) rather than enacted in a visible micro-choice that costs. The final fusion reads as catharsis, yet the causal chain to that surrender is compressed into one clause, muting the earned feel.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s contradictory impulses—climbing to escape time, yet surrendering to its return—are embodied in every beat; the “willingly perplexed” stance is dramatized, not labeled. Micro-choices (spreading cards on the saucer, tracing her hand on cloud-moss) externalize interior conflict with visible cost. The final renunciation—leaving the healed saucer in the yard—earns its poignancy through prior causal chain; grief’s clasp is unfastened only after memory floods her lungs. Interiority never drifts into therapy-speak; even the “choking beauty” is tasted as cold sugared milk, not abstract emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Halcyon’s interiority is lyrically dense yet character-specific; her contradictory impulse—to hoard ghosts yet refuse their despair—drives every beat. The gravitational mood/hull linkage makes her happiness a physical lever, turning emotion into ship mechanics without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (knotting hair-filament, releasing the sail) externalize pacifist creed under rising cost. Final renunciation to stay in the archive lands as earned stasis: she pays with eternal solitude, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority—“texture of transformation” refracted through volcanic glass—keeps contradictory wants alive: to give when empty, to guide while lost. Embodied emotion is specific (bare feet register cooled stone, bottle clink rings like a bell), never label-heavy. Micro-choice to submerge arms in glass carries visible cost—skin vs. molten medium—and earns the closure renunciation. Lira functions as catalyst only; relationship crucible not stressed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Garnet’s interior contradiction—obedience versus invention—animates every beat; the graphite quill is handled twice with escalating risk, showing value hierarchy under pressure. However, the moment she “lets the mask fall” is reported, not dramatized, so the cost is felt only at narrative remove, not in embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s barefoot vigil on frictionless stone bodies his interior state; the empty nets and pulsing pouch externalize conflict. The precognitive curse is not label-speak but a lived constraint that forces him to enact rather than alter the future. His final surrender is embodied in the dissolving eel, a micro-choice that costs him the need to understand. The only flaw: Mira remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“mask dangling like a penitent’s stone,” “constellation of welts along her ribs”—and her micro-choice to dissolve the manuscript rather than smuggle it is a credible, costly renunciation. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page, and the final disappearance is asserted rather than embodied, so the arc crests at strong, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—mechanic arm vs. mother’s voice—and the micro-choice to float the card create a credible, embodied shift; the renunciation of rivalry is earned through the prior coded duel, though Vale’s diplomatic-fierce label stays verbal.

    The pianist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the frozen clock yet ascending toward the cloud-garden—are dramatized in embodied beats (strapping the clock to her back with a silk scarf, striking the mute chime). The interior contradiction peaks when she chooses to leave the film-loop, paying the visible cost of reclaimed uncertainty; the final gesture (opening the lid, letting the new chime ring) crystallizes her re-valuation of waiting as active composition. No stock therapy-speak; every micro-choice (offering the chime, pressing the unresolved chord a last time) reveals the hierarchy of art over stasis. The broken clock as externalized flaw complicates every tactic and is honored, not cured.

Micro-choice to water the seed with laughter she will forget crystallizes her hierarchy of values on the page. The renunciation is earned: earlier dream-show of the fissure and the seed’s bargain foreclose any cheaper exit. Voice remains singular; no stock epiphanies or therapy-speak intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    The returnee’s motivation—rooted in ancestral rupture and diasporic longing—is embodied through tactile choices: kneeling to brush soil from a skull, aligning the sundial on vertebrae, planting a rib as gnomon. Her internal contradiction (between exile’s hollow and faith’s return) manifests not as summary but as micro-actions under pressure. The caretaker boy, though secondary, applies immediate thematic pressure with his “rebuild or rob” challenge, forcing stance crystallization.

Her final renunciation (keeping the confession) is earned by thirty years of layered self-erasure, with visible cost in the erased chalk spiral and fluttering pseudonyms. The childhood memory anchors motivation without over-explaining, and her hesitation feels authentically contradictory under pressure. No emotional summarizing; every feeling is filtered through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The embroiderer’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her micro-choices—humming reversed lullabies, folding the map carelessly, asking to read a “bedtime story”—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

The medium functions as catalyst, not crutch; the brother’s frozen pre-slam moment crystallizes the central conflict without dialogue. Final choice (“I’m sorry”) is earned by prior causality and exacts visible cost: healed lip, empty pockets, transformed letters. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    The translator’s interiority is richly embodied—cordite on the tongue, coral in the pocket—and his micro-choices (deciphering the cast, voicing symbols) reveal a hierarchy of guilt, duty, and fragile hope.

The final act of painting costs her present sorrow but earns laughter across centuries—a credible endurance with visible emotional cost that forecloses passive mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her frustration, curiosity, and surrender to uncertainty manifest through tactile interactions (spoon, nickel, tesserae). Her contradiction between methodical control and playful openness drives every micro-choice, culminating in the renunciation of certainty as restoration itself. The final line—"ready to bewitch the silence with a note she had never heard before"—captures her earned transformation without diagnostic label-speak. Flaws remain human: her reliance on ritual nearly blinds her to the city’s dreaming agency until the coin intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)

Emotion is rendered through sensory detail (“tasting nectar and nerves”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of stealth for open rebellion carries visible cost: exposure to Voss and the satellite pass.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zale’s interiority is vividly embodied—his exhaustion “a hollowing blade,” his longing condensing into dew—and his micro-choices (reading the postcard’s postscript, peeling it apart) stem from deep, consistent motives. His final renunciation of centuries of insomnia is earned through accumulated emotional weight, not epiphany. The cost—leaving behind all that longing—is viscerally rendered in the ascent/descent structure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mirela’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her contradictions (fugitive yet archivist, eraser yet preserver) pulse through micro-choices like pressing the meteorite into the sill or whispering to Inkspot. Her trauma and hope intertwine without therapy-speak, and her final renunciation of fixed identity (“travelers belong to no regime but gravity”) feels earned by prior acts of trust and concealment.

His internal contradiction (desire to disrupt monotony vs. refusal to collect tips) manifests in credible renunciation, not epiphany. Lila’s brief but precise characterization mirrors his analytical bent, making her a resonant vector, not a prop.

The climax crystallizes her renunciation of self into legacy, a cost rendered in trembling silver halide and echoing breath.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mirage painter’s motivation—born of traded maternal laughter for a borrowed heartbeat—is vividly embodied and consistently drives her micro-choices under pressure. Her internal contradiction (desire to transform mirrors vs. fear of losing her only compass) manifests simultaneously in tactile detail: pulse bucking while eyes stay “perceptively calm.” The final renunciation feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost: surrendering the heartbeat severs her personal anchor but seeds collective possibility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in silvered backs, moth-like flutters, and pigment-laden bell notes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and layered—his trembling hands, blood-inked names, and refusal to ask for forgiveness reveal a man shaped by grief, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lucien’s internal conflict—between aesthetic integrity and social responsibility—is rendered through embodied choices (refusing slogans, burning the stick, writing in ash) rather than abstract musing. His final declaration emerges credibly from witnessed reversals of his own life, with visible cost in lost patronage and enduring solitude.

However, his emotional state remains slightly too composed for someone freshly ejected from a public quarrel; the “uncommonly serene” trait risks flattening the expected turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)

    Mireya’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her grief, guilt, and archival duty collide in real-time choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)

However, secondary characters remain atmospheric rather than pressurized agents, limiting relational stakes. The final choice feels earned but leans slightly on thematic assertion over granular struggle.

    The cartomancer’s motivation—mapping cultural collapse through tarot—is rooted in personal history (her grandmother’s wartime readings) and present trauma (the crypto crash). Her interiority is vividly embodied: ink-stained fingers, barefoot data collection, bite-marked tape. Contradictory impulses—mystic intuition vs. Cartesian rigor—animate her actions without tidy resolution. The final renunciation (leaving footprints as ghost protocol) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The historian’s interiority is richly embodied—her anguish, resolve, and epiphanies arise from tactile interaction with the archive and its relics. Her micro-choices (walking backward while facing forward, removing the veil) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over erasure, shared burden over solitary purity. The flaw lies in slight emotional summarization (“anguished joy”) that borders on diagnostic phrasing, though it’s swiftly grounded in action. Her transformation feels earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marta and Jun embody consistent, character-specific traits—Marta’s lullaby calm, Jun’s perceptive youth—but the hound’s internal crisis leans slightly toward allegorical shorthand.

His motivation (to coax wonder) aligns with micro-choices: clutching the pendant, pausing at memory’s edge, stepping forward into myth. The transformation feels earned because his flaw (anxiety) becomes the conduit for transcendence. However, the stranger’s presence slightly flattens Elias’s agency; his final step leans more on revelation than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief manifests through tactile rituals (prism against glass, reading frost as braille), not diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (“I have let you go” vs. “I need you still”) act simultaneously in scene, and his final renunciation (“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”) earns closure with visible cost: the fractured prism left behind. The micro-choice to scrape frost and align the prism dramatizes his academic obsession turned pilgrimage, grounding motivation in action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    The spinner’s motivation—carrying a message across impossible distance—is rooted in deep personal history (the amber bead) and intensifies through embodied, contradictory choices: she desires connection yet sacrifices voice. Her internal conflict is shown through tactile action (crushing the bead, swallowing silence) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of speech is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: mute weaving, stoic tears, rewound orchard time. Every micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values where communication outweighs self-expression.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thistle’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meekness, quiet determination, and bartered confusion manifest through embodied choices (e.g., lining mine shafts with silk at twilight). His motivation intensifies credibly from personal ruin to communal transformation. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; the shift from confusion to resilience feels more lyrical than conflicted. Still, his final climb enacts a renunciation of isolation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    The map maker’s interiority is vividly embodied—her sensory perception, guilt, and moral reckoning arise through concrete action, not diagnosis. Her final choice to redirect future commissions emerges organically from the revelation of complicity, with clear cost: the collapse of her prior identity as neutral cartographer. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. duty, curiosity vs. dread) operate simultaneously in key moments, especially when reaching toward her younger self. No safety-hedging; her flaw—weaponized ignorance—is fully owned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s reticence, warmth, and ritualistic devotion are embodied through micro-choices—nudging sea glass, stacking stones, bottling absence—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal conflict (duty vs. grief, presence vs. invisibility) operates simultaneously without therapy-speak. The final act of rowing backward while holding green warmth in his palm crystallizes endurance with tangible cost: he cannot relight the lamp, only witness and preserve its memory.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lirael’s motivation evolves from ritual duty to world-altering agency through embodied choices—pressing the wick, laughing with cost—that reveal her internal contradiction: resisting prophecy while being its vessel. Her laugh isn’t just sound but action with consequence (erasing stars, birthing sunspots), and her final renunciation of heraldship for readership is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through tactile, surreal imagery (“chilled vein of lightning,” “wick consume itself”). The geas backstory is anchored in present sensation and alters her stance without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hoshiko’s interiority is vividly embodied through dye-work, wing-handling, and heart-beats; her micro-choices (aligning the wing, painting with tea) reveal a hierarchy of values. The donor heart’s “quietly explosive” memories function as both gift and burden, grounding her epiphany in tactile experience rather than abstraction. Her realization—that porousness, not ownership, magnetizes stories—is earned through sensory engagement, not diagnostic self-awareness. Flawless integration of profession, perception, and philosophical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she repairs instruments yet dismantles quantification, embodies grief while transmuting it.

The absence of diagnostic label-speak and the specificity of her recalled lullaby (“grandmother who smelled of crushed coriander”) ground her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—hiding yet seeking redemption—are embodied in tactile, sensory-rich choices (e.g., smoothing the invitation on the cold floor). Her empathy isn’t labeled but enacted through “tasting” borrowers’ emotions and ultimately dissolving into the library’s hush. The final renunciation—surrendering her body to become guardian—is earned by prior causality: her mistake, guilt, and realization that correcting the past requires forfeiting the future. Vale’s arrival tests her resolve without melodrama, making her transformation feel inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mila’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fear of sealing amnesia by eating the bread, her “heuristically gentle” handling, and tears salting ordinary crust reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic self-awareness.

Her final act of transferring data into a tree’s xylem crystallizes her renunciation of preservation for transmission, with visible cost: tears that refuse to fall, blood coughed onto mercury. Motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, and her flaws (rigid precision in a dissolving world) directly shape her tactics and ultimate sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The daughter’s interior conflict—wanting her father to stop her yet needing proof of his betrayal—is rendered through embodied contradiction (e.g., “half-moons into my skin,” rehearsing rescues that never come).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skeptic’s internal contradiction—between empirical doubt and embodied intuition—is vividly rendered through taste-based perception and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the ring to her lips). Her transformation feels earned, with clear cost: the loss of skepticism as armor.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—between memory as burden and gift, restoration and collaboration—are embodied in tactile, specific choices (e.g., cracked nails from drawing, tasting iron). Her motivation intensifies coherently from avoidance to active reclamation, culminating in a renunciation of solitary portraiture that forecloses her old livelihood with visible cost: she sells no faces that day.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)

The boy’s silent presence crystallizes her motive without diluting her singular POV.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    K-17’s interiority is richly embodied: its servos hum with memory fragments, fingers trace bark-like metal, and “inner static” manifests as neural interference. The android’s contradiction—programmed for order yet drawn to chaotic childhood fears—is dramatized through micro-choices (opening the box, merging with it) that escalate under magnetic pressure. Its transformation into “neither android nor memory, but both” feels earned by tactile engagement with the past.
