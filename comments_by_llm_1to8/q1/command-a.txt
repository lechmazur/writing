Her professional background as a neutron star researcher feels ornamental—no specific astronomical knowledge constrains her greenhouse experiments. The butterfly's materialization at the end reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice relies on abstract phrasing ("quiet architect," "kindled humility") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)

Her "steadily adaptive" trait functions as a label without visible cost—she simply decides to retrace the smuggler's route without internal friction. The apprentice's captivity is discovered off-page and doesn't force a meaningful choice or renunciation with felt consequence in the text. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("renewed determination," "mind racing with plans") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the tuning fork vibrations, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—"translator of silence" and "seeking to rectify what had been lost" feel more like labels than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The relationship with Kael applies pressure and the final choice (accepting silence as canvas) is earned, though the shift from frustration to understanding arrives quickly. Interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than character-particular thought under stress. The ending choice forecloses the active search for sound with visible cost, qualifying as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is given baseline motivation (burying the unburyable, stubbornness) and a quest structure, but his interior life reads as label-only. The lens-repair montage summarizes discovery rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. "Inadvertently stubborn" appears once as a character claim but never constrains a specific on-page decision with visible cost. The final smile and "weariness lifting" asserts transformation without embodied contradiction or the friction needed to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her agency feels declarative rather than tested under contradictory impulses. The widow encounter offers a micro-choice, yet the gathering proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward summary ("she felt a peace she hadn't known in years") rather than embodied contradiction in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's spiritual curiosity is labeled rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to place the pendant is undertaken without visible internal resistance or cost—she simply follows the sparks to their conclusion. Emotional progression moves too smoothly from trembling hands to "heart fuller" without the messy irrationality or self-deception that would make the arc credible. The past-life priestess backstory remains inert exposition that doesn't create a present micro-choice with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract therapeutic language ("retrocognitive entrapment," "quaking reverie," "texture of time") that feels more like prompt echo than embodied character thought. The motivation to restore fading photographs is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; her trembling hands and quickening heart are bodily clichés without specific embodiment. The final transformation ("she had discovered herself") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No genuine internal conflict surfaces—she pursues the fragment without hesitation, doubt, or cost until the vortex simply grants her wish.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The liberator is presented through external labels ("purpose that defied captivity," "patiently strategic") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The chains "fell away, as if they had never been there" reads as unmotivated convenience that undermines the supposed burden. Interiority remains abstract ("mind was sharp, honed by years of waiting") without embodied stress or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under the vault-chase pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses; her "purpose" and "peculiar gift" are told wholesale in paragraph one. The climactic forge moment relies on abstract emotional labels ("resonant ache," "raw and unfiltered") rather than embodied sensation. No micro-choices under pressure test her commitment; she moves from collect-to-imprint without friction, rendering the final realization unearned. The prose diagnoses her state ("trembling," "breath caught") instead of dramatizing conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation ("press her ear against destiny's door") is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice with visible cost. Her encounter with Elara follows polite dialogue beats rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final moment of "purpose" and "belief" reads as an unearned epiphany without prior struggle or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("veneer of ordinary life," "luminous disbelief") that labels state instead of particularizing perception.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to create "safe zones for inquiry" remains abstract and is told rather than tested through on-page conflict. Her internal state relies heavily on therapeutic language ("vulnerability," "growth," "healing") without embodied contradiction or struggle. The final gesture of placing the bookmark inside a sphere reads symbolic rather than causally motivated by prior pressure. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with visible cost; she completes her task without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's phobias are stated but never shown embodying her choices under pressure. The "trembling certainty" oscillates mechanically rather than creating genuine contradiction in action. Her adaptive skill is asserted ("firmly adaptive, a skill honed from years") but remains label-only; the decryption sequence lacks visceral struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final mirror-room epiphany arrives as therapy-speak ("You are not what they made you") rather than earned through dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The oracle's motivation ("to draw a map of an endless night") is stated but never tested by opposition or cost. Interior life relies on abstract phrases like "quiet intensity" and "obsession fueling their craft" without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile is a gesture without stakes—no path has been foreclosed, no visible price paid. The child-memory fragment arrives too late to shape earlier choices and reads as decorative backstory rather than a constraint that complicates present action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    Unit-7's motivation to "find where thoughts come from" is established but remains abstract throughout; the philosophical quest never translates into concrete micro-choices with competing costs. The "remarkably composed" trait is label-only—never constraining a choice or creating visible tension. The climactic "understanding" arrives as summary epiphany ("not in code or circuits, but in the vast, interconnected web of existence") without embodied contradiction or struggle in the moment. The final walk away feels asserted rather than earned by on-page causality that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (thaw mistrust) is clear and her final gesture is embodied through the sketch and lens. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract terms like "transparency" and "honesty" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Kian's arrival and response feel convenient rather than earned by prior friction; his immediate smile and poetic declaration bypass the mistrust the story claimed to overcome. The relationship shift lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life is present but remains abstracted through "reflected on," "felt," and "understood" structures rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final placement of the marble reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path—no sacrifice, no rejected alternative is legible on the page. The wisely-pragmatic trait is declared but never dramatizes a trade-off where wisdom conflicts with desire. Emotional progression moves through tidy stages (intrigued → reflective → closure) without messy simultaneity or irrational layering.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to prove time moves sideways is signaled early, but her decision-making lacks genuine internal conflict—she hesitates briefly, then pulls the lever without dramatized cost to competing values. The "icy warmth" attribute appears only as a label rather than shaping contradictory impulses in action. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart pounded, but her expression remained calm") and the final shift ("thawing slightly") tells emotional change rather than earning it through embodied micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is declared but never tested by meaningful friction or cost. Her transformation from musician to "conduit" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or sacrifice. The ghost functions as external guide rather than internal conflict, leaving Clara reactive throughout. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "breath caught" and "surge of inspiration" but no visceral contradiction that would make the final communion feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is heavily abstract—"swallowing truths," "fault-tolerant oracle"—with minimal embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wanderer's arrival and dialogue add relational pressure, but Elara's final choice (adding to the smudge rather than fixing it) feels more thematic gesture than character-driven agency with visible cost. Motivation remains stated rather than tested through competing desires; the "auroral sorrow" label recurs without specific sensory grounding. The piece leans on therapy-speak constructions ("contradictions, lies, and half-truths in her mind") that flatten interiority at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to seek her father's truth is clear, but her interior life remains thin—we get label-only skepticism ("religiously skeptical nature") rather than embodied contradiction. The recklessness is asserted but never tested; she encounters no genuine on-page struggle that reveals competing impulses. The final choice to turn the valve feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality, and the "weight lift from her chest" closure reads as emotional summary without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is stated but never genuinely tested—she simply follows the map because it intrigues her, then returns unchanged in action. The swan's trembling and the mirror visions are externally imposed rather than driven by her contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("breath catch," "grip reality loosely") and the ending asserts transformation ("she had become the silence") without showing a foreclosed path or visible cost in her subsequent behavior. The journals she "did not remember writing" is a convenience that bypasses agency.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("mellow," "softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "shift" in Finn is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, humming, holding Finn's hand) but they do not reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost—they feel like therapeutic gestures without genuine risk or trade-off. Elara's motivation remains externalized and declarative rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is label-only: "odd historian," "sensitively perceptive" appear as tags without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. Her obsession with the tapestry and belief in the displaced axis are declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The climactic ritual sequence ("her mind probing," "her heart beating in time") relies on stock interiority and perfect execution without genuine struggle or blind spots. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the protagonist remains competent and untroubled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    Li Wei remains a cipher throughout—motivations are asserted ("to unravel the mysteries") rather than earned through contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. The "accidentally prophetic" trait is label-only; no on-page moment dramatizes how the fortunes function or what cost their prophetic nature imposes. Interiority consists of generic metaphysical assertions ("power to orchestrate events") without character-particular texture or genuine struggle. The shift from fortune writer to "conductor of fate" lacks causal grounding in concrete choice or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    The priest is defined entirely through abstract labels ("loop pedal priest," "guardian of time and sound") without embodied emotion, micro-choices under pressure, or internal contradiction. Interiority is replaced by metaphysical narration ("his voice could weave and rewind moments") that tells function rather than showing stakes-driven choice. The "climax" — the priest declaring "The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity" — arrives without prior struggle or contradictory impulses; the possession simply "recoils" without earned cost or alteration in the protagonist. Motivation remains declarative and external throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    The fortune cookie writer remains wholly abstract—no contradictory impulses, no embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies") that label rather than dramatize. The slump at the end is told, not earned through prior struggle or visible cost. No micro-choices alter tactics; the character observes and inscribes without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's "gravity defier" power remains label-only; no on-page moment shows her manipulating physics to force a choice or pay a cost. Internal states are summarized abstractly ("the weight of her gift," "darkness in her own heart stirred") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The encounter with alternate selves offers potential for friction, but each version is viewed in static silence without forcing a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final "embrace" epiphany arrives unearned, declared rather than dramatized through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to overcome numbness is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "raw, aching aliveness") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivations are declared ("nurture integrity in solitude") rather than embodied through conflicting choices under pressure. His "credibly curious nature" reads as a label; the curiosity itself never costs him anything or forces a tradeoff on the page. The final acceptance of a "new purpose" arrives without visible sacrifice or internal contradiction—he simply shifts from storm recorder to truth-bearer. Embodied emotion is sparse; the courtyard tension and racing heart are stock physiological markers rather than character-specific distress.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("discover the texture of time") remains abstract throughout; his micro-choices in the grotto—kneeling, tracing patterns, reciting a poem—feel exploratory rather than driven by contradictory impulses under pressure. The final smile and rope-coiling read as resolution, but the choice itself lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths on the page. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("freedom also meant solitude") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("beauty in the unfinished") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her decision to play and tell a story feels inevitable from the start, with no genuine obstacle or internal conflict. The final act—placing the bowl back and leaving—carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("renewed sense of purpose") rather than embodied, character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "affectionate detachment" and "professional thoroughness" remain labels without visible cost or internal friction in the peak beat. The transformation she performs lacks agency—she executes a commission without meaningful resistance or moral calculus. Kael exists only in summary; no on-page relationship pressure tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—compassion as a cycle—but her interior remains thin. She glides through choices without visible internal conflict; the decision to reach out carries no dramatized cost or competing impulse. The locket photo is handled repeatedly yet functions as a talisman rather than a pressure point that forces contradictory wants. Clara's grandmother reveal at the end feels like a convenience that tidies meaning rather than complicating Elara's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to belong is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract longing rather than embodied contradiction. The "boldly sympathetic nature" remains a label without on-page cost or friction—no moment dramatizes what she sacrifices or misreads through excessive sympathy. The final belonging feels declared by Echo's pronouncement rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses an alternative path. Interiority often summarizes emotional states ("luminescent ache," "quiet warmth") instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("interrupted cadence of her life," "spaces between moments") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her decision to descend is triggered by the pendant's pull rather than a choice that reveals competing values. The grandmother's backstory is told rather than anchored in present micro-choices. Emotional states are labeled ("felt a strange pull," "newfound grace") instead of enacted through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is established but remains abstract—"understanding the mathematics of emotion" never translates into concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her discovery of the journal triggers no visible internal conflict; she moves from caution to "renewed determination" without dramatized cost. The final breakthrough ("not about control but about harmony") reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "mind racing") without embodied specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    The crawl space dweller remains a charitable abstraction rather than a contradictory individual. Motivation is stated ("to become visible") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost—the character works methodically, finds fragments, and smiles at the end without foreclosing any path or paying a price. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("their own cached memories," "letting the words wash over them") that labels rather than embodies. The final "smile" and sense of connection arrive unearned, with no prior struggle or competing impulse dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation shifts from plant study to personal transformation, but the turn feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The leaf operates as a convenient catalyst that dissolves agency—she "simply let them flow through her" without visible internal resistance or cost. Interiority leans heavily on abstract claims ("the fear, the longing, the possibility of change") rather than embodied contradiction. The final metamorphosis is declared complete without demonstrable forfeiture of her control-driven identity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's insomnia and artistic search are established but remain largely told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to follow the rain trails and later to accept the book from the old woman feel prompted by external mysticism rather than internal conflict with visible cost. The final painting moment gestures toward transformation but the change is declared ("it all made sense now") rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on abstractions like "unyielding search for clarity" and "buzzing with questions" without character-particular texture or embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is abstract and label-heavy ("gnawing doubt," "surge of purpose") rather than embodied. Her clairvoyant failure is told as backstory without on-page consequence that shapes a choice. The "inhabitance" sequence uses stock mystical phrasing ("consciousness merging," "embrace the unknown") that reads generic. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; the arc is a smooth ascent to enlightenment without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to compile fragments is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely declarative ("her mind racing," "heart quickened") rather than contradictory or embodied. The encounter with the mysterious woman offers a micro-choice (raising the valve again), yet the decision carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply accepts her role. The piece leans on labeled emotions and lacks the messy simultaneity of conflicting impulses that would elevate characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is established with clear traits (meticulous, analytical-artistic) and her investigation creates forward motion, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("trembling certainty," "quiet resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to punch the ticket feels unmotivated—no prior beat dramatizes what she risks or what specific fear she overcomes. The transformation is asserted ("she no longer feared the mysteries") rather than earned through visible cost or a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains largely static, her "sympathetic skeptic" label announced but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The transformation from skeptic to believer unfolds through passive reception of visions rather than difficult micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract longing ("a void, a longing for something she couldn't quite name") and therapy-speak epiphany ("courageously kind hands") rather than embodied contradiction. The tile does the work; Elara observes and transcribes without agency that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elyr's motivation ("to discover what happens after goodbye") is clear and drives his choices, but his internal experience remains abstract throughout—labels like "endless, aching void" and "hunger he hadn't felt in millennia" replace embodied contradiction. The peak moment (fragment shattering) delivers generic catalog emotions ("fear, exhilaration, wonder") rather than character-specific reaction. The final "spark of purpose" reads as summary rather than earned transformation through on-page micro-choices; no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's honesty trait is established but remains mostly declarative rather than forcing embodied contradictions in scene. Her key choice—confronting her father about asylum—arrives but lacks visible internal conflict or cost in the moment; the resolution ("the fair trade she sought wasn't between her and her father—it was within herself") reads as an unearned epiphany delivered via narrator summary rather than dramatized pressure. Father's motivations are sketched but not tested under Clara's push. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("her mind wandering," "her voice trembling but firm") and the final shift feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to collect invented histories is stated but never tested by a meaningful choice or contradiction. Her "studious nature" and "earnest" demeanor are label-only traits; no on-page action reveals a trade-off or cost.

Interiority remains generic ("heart raced," "hands trembling") with no embodied contradiction or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The wanderer's interior reads as abstract template rather than embodied experience: "filtered reality differently, seeing patterns where others saw chaos" is told-only without specific sensory demonstration. Motivation ("discover the texture of memories") remains a label throughout; no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or cost. The letter moment ("their own nameless identity echoing in the boy's desperation") gestures toward internal conflict but stays at summary level. The final stance crystallization lacks visible trade-off—continuation of the quest feels inevitable rather than chosen against something.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is stated clearly but her internal conflict remains thin—she's a "myth buster" seeking something intangible, yet no credible struggle between her skepticism and her quest appears on the page. The grandfather's voice and the cello moment offer embodied emotion, but the epiphany ("the riddle isn't to be solved, it's to be lived") arrives as assertion rather than earned reversal. Micro-choices are absent; she plays, pauses, and understands without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The final smile is labeled "bittersweet" but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—she moves through beats without internal friction or visible cost to her choices. The "orderly intuitive mind" remains a label rather than a trait that constrains action. Vorin is a one-dimensional obstacle whose dismissal ("Progress is coming, whether you like it or not") reads like placeholder antagonism. The festival resolution arrives without Lira foreclosing any live option or paying a dramatized price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's dedication to preservation is clear, but her interior life defaults to generic melancholy rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor's posthumous message provides motivation, yet her response feels more dutiful than conflicted—no real choice between preservation and self-preservation materializes on the page. The "lump formed in her throat" and similar emotional labels substitute for specific sensory pressure. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, scanning, documenting) but none foreclose a live path with visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her blindness is handled with some specificity (water refraction, air shifts), but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The "heartfelt artisan" designation feels asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her calm is magnetic but static; we see competence without genuine struggle or a hierarchy of values tested on the page. The final moment of satisfaction lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path—restoration succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently pursued, but her "subtly confident" demeanor operates mostly as a label without on-page contradiction or cost. The final choice—kneeling by the stream and accepting the discovery—lacks earned tension; no previous action genuinely threatened her goal or forced a tradeoff. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("storm of thoughts brewing," "her heart quickened") rather than character-particular thought patterns. The tears "not of joy but of understanding" edge toward diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is characterized solely through summary labels ("infinitely patient," "enigmatic") rather than contradictory impulses shown in action. His motivation to restore balance remains abstract and unexplored; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values or internal conflict. The protagonist's actions are repetitive routines lacking genuine struggle or cost—he walks, listens, and the town passively responds without forcing difficult trade-offs. No embodied emotion or character-particular interiority; the piece reads as allegory with a placeholder figure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("unexpected connection," "deep motivation") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from survival to discovery at the end feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a live option.

The piece tells us she "let go of her fears" without dramatizing what that costs in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation—redeeming his father's legacy—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The interior relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("chasing hush," "thread this labyrinth") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The climactic decision to "tell his story" arrives as summary epiphany rather than enacted struggle with visible cost. Interiority reads generic and detached, failing to ground choices in body or contradictory desires.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ghost bride's motivation (repaying a debt) is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths. Interiority leans heavily on abstract labels—"mournful elation," "lovingly venomous"—without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. The whispered collective of other spirits in paragraph five dilutes focus without pressing her toward a visible trade-off. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost appears; she simply steps forward with "a glimmer of hope," an assertion rather than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains abstract throughout—her "poetic wharf weaver" role is label-only and never dramatized through actual weaving choices or trade-offs. Internal experience is filtered through elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic aura," "orchid solace") rather than embodied contradiction. The sleepwalking method removes agency; she follows "an unseen force" rather than making pressured micro-choices. No visible cost attends her final rest; the task completes without foreclosing any live option.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to restore faith is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interior voice relies on stock phrasing ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") and therapy-speak ("shattered by years of wandering") rather than embodied contradiction. The final discovery feels unearned—no genuine struggle or foreclosed path accompanies the restoration. Micro-choices (lifting the sundial, clearing debris) advance plot mechanically without revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra is labeled "carefully inventive" but her choices lack visible cost or genuine internal conflict. The decoding mission proceeds smoothly without foreclosing paths or forcing trade-offs that reveal contradictory impulses. Her motivation to "discover meaning in the margins" remains abstract assertion rather than embodied struggle. The letter's discovery feels convenient rather than earned through prior difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is present but operates at a remove—her "heart quickened" and she "wondered" feel like labeled states rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to "work through the night" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; we see activity but no dramatized renunciation or altered stance. Lira's sudden return and exposition-heavy dialogue flatten what could be a relationship crucible into plot delivery. The dagger reach and hesitation gestures are repeated templates that don't reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to find the moment before deciding") but her interior life reads as abstract and expository rather than embodied. The past regret is told in summary ("someone she had left behind, someone she had never apologized to") without micro-choices or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final act of reading her own letter feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure, and the resolution ("she felt whole") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is present but the internal contradiction necessary for tension is absent—she moves through decryption without meaningful doubt or cost until the ending. The "lotus-hearted ache" and "shrewdly innocent" labels replace embodied emotion; we're told she's conflicted but shown smooth execution. The anesthetic mention is ornamental, never constraining a choice. Backstory about her translator work exceeds 25% without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior is delivered through reflection and summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The motivation (rediscovering lost joy) is told in paragraphs 1 and 2, then confirmed by tears and realization in paragraph 6, but no on-page choice forces her to trade off competing values. The final "work complete" moment lacks visible cost—what did she forfeit or endure to paint the fog?

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's shift from methodical restoration to intuitive "conducting" is present but undermotivated—her hesitation is noted, then dissolved by a warm coin pulse rather than dramatized internal conflict. The obsidian-eyed woman's instruction arrives as external permission rather than emerging from Elara's own contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority reads as declarative summary ("her heart raced, her mind a whirlwind") rather than sensory particulars under pressure. The final change lacks visible cost: certainty is exchanged for curiosity via declaration, not forfeiture of a concrete option or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias registers as a charming rogue scholar in label only; his interior life consists of template reactions ("heart quickened," "mind racing") without contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. Dr. Krane's test-reveal feels convenient rather than earned by prior tension. The final choice to join the meeting carries no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page—Elias simply agrees and follows. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("chaos converging in his chest") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains a collection of labels rather than a living consciousness under pressure. Her "shyly unstoppable" nature is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices with visible cost. The galaxy postcard functions as symbolic furniture, not an object that constrains her decisions. Interiority is decorative—"photosynthesizing pain into beauty" and "blossom armistice" are thematic packaging that never ground in specific bodily experience or competing wants that force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by genuine friction—she drifts through the library without contradictory impulses or on-page cost. The "foxglove regret" is named but not embodied in action or choice; her interior reads as abstract poetic narration rather than character-particular perception. No micro-choices narrow options; the song and Vessel appear to guide her without agency or struggle. The final "quiet triumph" is asserted, not earned through a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "carefully reckless" trait is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory action under pressure. Her internal journey from recklessness to care is told via reflection and the inkwell ritual rather than shown through difficult micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The mentor relationship has emotional weight but Kael appears only at the end, reducing the crucible effect. The resolution feels convenient—writing with magical ink solves the trust fracture without visible interpersonal cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is declared (harmonize conflicting values) but never internally contradictory or tested by a visible tradeoff on the page. His "trembling" is asserted twice but remains ornamental; the text tells us he's resolving to find balance, yet we never see him struggle between what the villagers want and what the scholars want in a moment that costs him something. The final design is sketched in dust and accepted by both parties off-page, foreclosing any dramatized choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his mind worked like the gears") and the epiphany arrives without prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs is clear, but her character remains largely abstract—"courier pigeon trainer" and "reinventing personal history" function as labels without forcing contradictory impulses into scene work. The final moment of rediscovery reads as summary ("she had preserved herself") rather than a visible choice with cost. Interiority leans heavily on stock phrases ("fragmented thoughts," "blooming and withering parts of her soul") that flatten particularity. The pigeons and dust-mapping occupy her time but never pressure her into a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her determination is embodied through movement ("sharp yet deliberate"), but interiority trends abstract with therapy-adjacent phrasing ("strange kind of closure," "heavy yet strangely at peace"). The memory sequence shows embodied contradiction—burying a memory then standing in it—but the final renunciation feels asserted rather than dramatized through visible cost on the page. Internal voice remains consistent but leans toward elevated diction that doesn't always feel character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "decipher the language of the land and sky" and find belonging registers on the page, but her choices remain largely observational rather than decisive. The firefly dance sequence shows embodied emotion ("breath fogging the surface," "laughter echoing"), yet the final pod hesitation reads as a micro turn without foreclosing a path with visible cost—she steps back, dances, then leaves as planned. Internal contradiction is present (solitude vs. connection) but doesn't drive competing impulses that narrow options at closure. The burnt feather as symbolic anchor feels ornamental; it's mentioned but doesn't constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation—recovering her grandmother's lost memory—anchors the piece, but the emotional work remains largely internal and declarative. The moment she "realizes the glass was not just a tool but a mirror" arrives as an epiphany told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final smile and sense of peace feel premature; no visible cost forecloses a path, and the renunciation of completeness is asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a concept rather than a character under pressure. His interiority consists entirely of philosophical assertion ("he believed monotony was the enemy") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose options. The act itself is narrated as observation of others' movements mirrored by a chess piece, but no internal struggle, trade-off, or cost appears—he simply executes a predetermined performance. The final walk into the night is summary rather than a dramatized stance crystallization with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's core motivation—to preserve memory through verse—is clear, but her interior experience remains distant and abstract. The "trembling hands" and "urge to fledge" gesture at embodied emotion without specificity. The ending stance (holding out her arm in defiance) feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The sentinel's pause reads as externally imposed rather than causally motivated by prior character work.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is established with a consistent trait (pattern-reading) and a clear motivation (to illuminate the mundane), but his journey lacks contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. His arc moves from ritual observation to decision without visible cost or renunciation—he simply continues doing what he already does. The final choice to "share his reckonings" is asserted rather than dramatized, with no on-page foreclosure of alternatives. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied, contradictory emotions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("bargained away innocence," "balance the guilt") rather than embodied contradiction. The reflection-heavy structure offers biographical summary but lacks micro-choices under pressure that reveal character through action. The final decision—placing the box on the ridge—feels declared rather than earned by prior struggle; no visible cost or foreclosed path is dramatized. "Gently skilled" remains ornamental; the trait never constrains or enables a choice with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma. Her "logical dreamer" trait manifests only as label and reflection; no on-page choice reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The pattern-making is ornamental rather than goal-driven, and the ending epiphany ("hope...is not something to be calculated, but something to be felt") arrives without causal pressure or visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "trial balloons of her own making") rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Echo Cartographer's motivation is stated but not contradicted in action; her "sensitively perceptive nature" remains label-only without embodied cost or tradeoff. The protagonist's choices (sifting diaries, following the map, pressing the wall) are functional but lack internal conflict—she moves from clue to clue without genuine struggle. The final realization ("the walls didn't dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered") arrives as epiphany rather than earned insight, and the burden's transformation ("it no longer felt heavy. It felt like purpose") resolves tension without visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (persuading mirrors) is clear but her interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The "borrowed heartbeat" conceit appears as metaphor without concrete stakes: we're told it costs her pulse, but no micro-choice dramatizes the trade-off or reveals what she risks losing. The final trembling hands gesture toward cost, but the sacrifice feels declared rather than earned through prior causal pressure. Emotional progression is smooth rather than contradictory; no visible struggle between want and fear complicates her grace.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her operatively gentle approach is demonstrated through measured words and calming presence. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("weight of her mission," "ideals...chipped away") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic speech ("The price of redemption...") feels療apeutic and over-articulated for someone mid-negotiation crisis. The final moment offers reflection but not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she "allows herself hope" without demonstrated trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through genuine contradiction. The "amoral philanthropist...secretly sentimental" frame is stated outright ("she'd never admit it") instead of emerging through on-page friction. Her interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("yearning to mend the fractures") and imagined memories of birds she's never seen, which reads as convenient rather than embodied. The final act—placing the egg—feels inevitable from paragraph one, with no meaningful cost visible in her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to defy the lullaby of conformity") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her "bodily poetic grace" and "chaste courtesan" status remain labels without contradiction or consequence—no moment forces her to choose between seduction and defiance, or shows how her role complicates the mission. The untangling sequence offers no genuine struggle or mistake; she succeeds via unearned intuition ("guided by an intuition she couldn't explain"). Interiority is abstract ("weight of their lives, their hopes, their fears") rather than embodied, and the final "small smile" reads as stock rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior is largely told rather than shown through embodied action under pressure. The "uncommonly serene demeanor" and ethical wrestling remain label-level; we never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The moment he stands with renewed purpose reads as an unearned epiphany—the shift from doubt to clarity lacks the micro-choices and visible cost that would ground it. The argument catalyst occurs off-page, so the on-page motivation feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is defined primarily through actions and philosophical stance, but interior contradiction is absent—she moves through ritualized behaviors without competing impulses. The motivation to "honor overlooked histories" remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice tests competing values or reveals hierarchy under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse: "felt it deeply" tells rather than shows perception degrading or sharpening. The final descent feels like completion of a task rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear, but her interior life remains generic. The "technically gentle" craft and "snowmelt ardor" are told labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. The final discovery of her own name among the forgotten reads as convenience rather than earned self-confrontation. No meaningful internal conflict complicates her path; she works "tirelessly" without struggle or mis-step that would foreground genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Foresight remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle, only stated dedication. The "transcend" moment reads as abstract elevation rather than embodied tension; we see no micro-choices under pressure, no flaws that complicate the path. Interiority consists of stock philosophical phrasing ("collective unconscious," "deep, abiding connection") rather than character-particular thought. The final "sense of closure, yet also a newfound sense of wonder" is emotionally tidy and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kael's "empirically ironic nature" and "frugal habits" are stated labels without dramatized contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His quest proceeds in a linear summary—finds tile, deciphers it, embraces unknown—without internal conflict forcing a hierarchy of values. The final paragraph claims emotional shift ("once made him question…now compelled him") through assertion rather than on-page struggle. No embodied tension between skepticism and faith alters a single tactic or forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "scheming pacifist" stance is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her method—reaching into Kael's memory—happens without hesitation or cost, rendering her more facilitator than character. Kael's shift from "impenetrable and cold" to "a glimmer of hope" in moments feels unearned; no visible internal contradiction acts in scene, only smooth persuasion. The therapy-speak interiority ("cellular memory," "reclaiming grace") labels emotional states without embodied tension, particularly damaging in the climactic exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to capture a runaway dream") is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her interior remains generic—"her heart yearned for the impossible"—without embodied contradiction or character-specific perception. The stranger functions as a prop-delivery device with no pressure applied, and Elara's competence encounter no genuine struggle; her hands "moved without her conscious direction," which externalizes agency at the pivotal recreation beat. The final choice to step outside feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path, and the "firmly grounded" attribute contradicts rather than complicates her ascent into dream-world without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motives are present—repairing the broken vow, reconnecting with her daughter—but interiority leans heavily on abstract language ("questioning her methods and motives," "hope and regret"). The "endearingly feisty" trait is labeled but never constrains a choice or forces a visible tradeoff on the page. Internal contradiction is missing; her journey from doubt to hope flows too smoothly without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to pursue forbidden knowledge") is declared early but never tested by a competing want or cost. Her interiority relies on stock abstractions—"bewildered," "disquiet," "strange clarity"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's late arrival delivers exposition rather than forcing Elara to choose or renounce, and the final "ready to face them" is an assertion of change with no visible forfeiture on the page. Agency remains passive; she receives explanations rather than earning insight through action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "carefully resourceful" trait exists only as label; we never see her make a trade-off or struggle with limited means. Her decisions (plucking the flower, bargaining with the guardian) arrive without visible cost or internal contradiction. Kael is a prop who delivers urgency then vanishes. The "unheard symphony" that "only she could hear" is asserted twice but never shown to constrain a choice or reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (finding the garden to find herself/her twin) is clearly stated, but her interior life remains largely decorative. The "unkindled solace" and "blissfully aberrant" labels are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final threshold crossing lacks a visible forfeiture or dilemma that would demonstrate earned change; Lyra's voice offers guidance, but Elara's acceptance of her "aberrant" parts arrives without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is introduced with abstract labels ("adaptability," "warmly methodical") rather than contradictory impulses shown in scene. The examination of the seal and rope moves without any genuine internal conflict or struggle—she simply knows what to do and executes it. No visible cost attends her discoveries; the protagonist solves a centuries-old puzzle in a single session with confident expertise, no missteps, no trade-offs. The ending grants her complete success and harmony without foreclosing any path or showing what she gave up.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is stated clearly but her interiority remains abstract—"heart steady," "spirit light"—without embodied contradiction or pressure-driven micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final moment grants her success without visible cost or foreclosed path; she completes her task and smiles, a resolution that feels awarded rather than earned through struggle. Internal conflict is absent; she moves through obstacles without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The echo chamber stone and conjuring function as tools she deploys without friction, and no relationship on the page tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to prove that coincidences have meaning") but remains abstract and untested by genuine internal conflict. The sacrifice-of-memory beat introduces stakes, yet the emotional cost is summarized rather than embodied—"her memories began to fade" tells us change rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "sense of peace" resolves tension too cleanly without visible struggle or renunciation that forecloses a credible alternative path. Interiority leans toward therapeutic self-awareness ("if coincidences had meaning, then her pain was not in vain") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "preemptively nostalgic" trait is introduced early, but it remains largely a label rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions are methodical and consistent—measuring shadows, recording notes, touching the fog wall—yet no genuine internal conflict complicates these choices. The visions she receives ("a city in flames, a child's laughter, a promise whispered in the dark") arrive as passive download rather than forcing a decision with visible cost. The final ascent to the observatory reads as task completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path or alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she arrives resolved and remains so. The fortress inhabitants are shadow-figures without individuated response; their sudden cheer at the end lacks earned causality. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "her heart ached, but her resolve deepened" reads as template emotion rather than embodied sensation. The piece tells us she "knew her task" and "her resolve deepened" without showing micro-choices that reveal cost or doubt under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but her choices remain abstract; she "seeks texture" yet never faces a concrete cost or contradiction that forces her to renounce or choose. The jade cicada warms and the grotto "whispers encouragement," but no obstacle tests her method—her epiphany arrives without struggle. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized: "Her motivation had shifted" tells rather than shows a renunciation or gain with visible cost. The relationship with Kael is referenced but never pressures a present choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and yearning are established early, but the character relies heavily on abstract motivations ("collect the flavors of different silences") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The doll functions more as talisman than as choice driver; Elara's climb is resolved through atmospheric description rather than micro-choices with visible cost. The ending shift ("she would never be the same") is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or altered capability.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains thin—most beats describe rather than dramatize internal conflict. Mira's transition from restless to at-peace feels underearned; we see her fidgeting ease without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The storm glass vial does much of the emotional work that character choices should drive. Embodied emotion is present but often labeled ("restless eyes betrayed her inner turmoil") rather than shown through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira is labeled "wisely adventurous" but her choices on the page are linear puzzle-solving with no visible internal conflict or competing impulses. The ruby flake's glow guides her mechanically through each step, removing agency from the protagonist. The final "understanding" that the throne is collective wisdom arrives as an unearned epiphany with no prior dramatization of want versus fear. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "sense of fulfillment") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("suffocating presence," "hollow ache") rather than embodied contradiction. The scar-link mechanic is established early, but the protagonist's internal conflict during the climactic choice is summarized ("faces of those she had saved") instead of dramatized with competing impulses. The sacrifice of severing a scar-link reads as告知-only cost; we don't witness a micro-choice that reveals what she's giving up or why this particular soul mattered, flattening the emotional stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's backstory as a "pyramid scheme survivor" is mentioned but never constrains a present choice or creates visible internal contradiction. Her "virtuously mischievous" trait remains a label without embodied demonstration—no on-page moment shows her bending rules with felt cost. The final decision to "use this knowledge" is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that narrow options. The future-self encounter resolves pressure without dramatizing Elara's own struggle or contradictory impulses in the climactic chamber scene.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor's motivation to uncover family truth is stated early but never tested by a genuine on-page choice with visible cost. Her interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("eloquently silent," "bridge of intuition") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The journal revelation arrives via a shadowfigure hand-off with no prior dramatized struggle, flattening what should be a pivotal moment. The "dynasty ender" label is ornamental; no action demonstrates what ending the dynasty costs her or forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    Alaric's motivation ("to capture the shape of possibility") arrives clearly but his internal contradiction remains abstract—withdrawal versus transformation is stated rather than enacted through simultaneous impulses in the peak beats. The gauntlet removal gesture and program-handling provide embodied moments, but the shift from passive knight to "storyteller, a weaver of possibility" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("shivering bliss," "withdrawn nature") without visceral embodiment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but rarely tested under pressure. Her "broken-hearted" state and emancipation history are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices with visible cost. The final "lighter heart" resolves her brokenness too tidily without dramatized struggle—she finds purpose through archival detective work but no choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values. Interior voice leans on summary ("she felt a kinship") rather than specific perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is stated clearly ("hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") but her interiority relies on abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "underestimated rebel" framing is told repeatedly without dramatizing genuine stakes or miscalculation that compounds. Her resourcefulness is asserted ("carefully resourceful," piecing together puddle maps) but the final choice—transmitting the ledger—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply adapts and vanishes, leaving no felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The saxophonist lacks interiority and embodied emotion; he functions as a cipher executing actions without internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is declared ("to hush a prophecy") but never tested through conflicting impulses or visible cost—he plays, the prophecy dissolves, no path is foreclosed. The prose relies on stock bodily clichés ("chest rising and falling") and label-only emotional states ("eerie nostalgia") rather than character-particular perception. No meaningful change or credible endurance emerges; the protagonist succeeds without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is conveyed through detailed sensory observation and declared motivation ("decode the message in falling leaves"), but the story lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation ("something had shifted forever") reads as summary rather than embodied cost earned through specific choices under pressure. Her discovery of the moonstone and subsequent actions follow curiosity without visible internal conflict or a meaningful path foreclosed. The progression from "orderly seed sorter" to "weaver of tales" is told rather than dramatized through on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tinkerer's core trait—belief that "time was less about precision and more about the stories it carried"—is stated rather than tested under pressure. His journey from control-seeking to "befriending uncertainty" proceeds through observation and passive discovery rather than contradictory impulses forcing difficult trade-offs. The final epiphany ("when coincidence becomes pattern, it's not randomness—it's guidance") arrives as therapeutic insight rather than embodied cost. The stranger, compass, and map function as conveniences that guide without requiring the protagonist to sacrifice a live option or confront a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation ("understand the weight of names") is abstract and never translates into contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her internal journey is told through summary ("she realized," "she understood") rather than embodied decisions that foreclose options. The coin visions sequence offers stock epiphanies—king, mother, wanderer—without showing how these fragments conflict or compel a costly choice on the page. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost; the ending grants resolve without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—"to integrate laughter into healing"—is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The figure's confession unfolds smoothly without resistance or complication from Elara's flaws. "Modestly fearless" remains a label; no moment shows her trading one value for another or paying a visible cost for her choice to listen. The ending grants her fulfillment without foreclosing a live option or requiring sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—"to discover the mathematics of mercy"—remains abstract throughout; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "enhanced interrogation survivor" label and "proprioceptively enhanced senses" function as told backstory without embodied trade-offs or mistakes under pressure. The pewter mask strap release at the end gestures at change, but the path from trauma memory to this renunciation lacks causal specificity—no prior beat shows her wrestling with keeping versus releasing it. Interiority relies on therapeutic abstraction ("transform pain into purpose") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lila's motivation to honor overlooked histories is declared but never dramatized as an internal conflict with contradictory impulses. Her work proceeds smoothly through market, painting, map, and tower without genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The lens fragment glows conveniently to guide her, removing agency from discovery. Interiority reads as generic ("her heart quickened," "she felt them around her") without embodied specificity or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is declared early ("to discover what ceilings hide") but remains abstract until the climb. His "skillfully observant" trait enables the dust-pattern analysis, yet the ghost-seeing ability feels decorative—it guides him but never complicates his choices with cost or contradiction. The final insertion of the barrel and descent read as smooth execution without internal conflict or a foreclosed path; the "weightless burden lifted" tells relief rather than showing a tradeoff. Interiority leans on stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "chill ran down his spine") and the closing peace arrives without visible renunciation or agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation "to compress eternity into a single, perfect moment" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her discovery of the bottle and journey into the clouds unfold without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she simply follows the whisper's guidance. The final return feels ordained rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("her heart quickened," "she realized") instead of embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("temporal plasticity," redemption) but her choices feel pre-ordained rather than pressured. The night-infiltration unfolds without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her tears at the vision read as label-only emotion ("burnished sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. The triumph-as-bittersweet coda tells us wounds remain unhealed without dramatizing what she renounces or what path closes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains functionally reactive throughout, his "curiosity" serving as blanket motivation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The stranger vanishes conveniently, removing relational friction. The final restoration feels declared rather than earned through visible psychological cost—Elias "understood" rather than renounced or transformed on the page. Interior voice converges with narrator voice into elevated fantasy register, flattening POV particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior voice carries a consistent aesthetic filter (petrichor, sensory collection), but her motivations remain abstract—"seeking stories," "finding what you seek"—without contradictory impulses or visible emotional cost under pressure. The compass-drop moment gestures toward renunciation but reads as philosophical acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a lived path; no trade-off between competing wants appears on the page. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart quickened," "breath catching" are stock markers. The psychometry flashes offer atmospheric backstory but do not alter her present stance or constrain a micro-choice in the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is introduced through label-heavy exposition rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her "turbine-hum reverie" and "perpetually learning" are asserted traits rather than contradictions that complicate action. The chamber discovery prompts a declarative shift ("no longer just a sculptor") without visible internal resistance or cost—she accepts her new role instantly. The decision to "carry this legacy forward" feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to capture an ineffable dream—but her interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("quiet drive," "heart full") without embodied contradiction. The journey to the cathedral constitutes a decision under pressure, yet the resolution feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle; the final realization arrives as assertion, not dramatized cost. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply. Backstory (grandmother's moonflower, dream fragments) remains well under 20% and anchors present choices, satisfying BRR without penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover suppressed histories is established, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("retrocognitively trapped," "echoes of voices long silenced") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously. The diary-clutching and beach-debris ritual show goal-driven action, yet no genuine internal conflict emerges—her determination never wavers or costs her anything on the page. The figure's appearance feels like a convenience that validates her quest rather than forcing a difficult choice or foreclosing a path. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she ends with "a glimmer of hope" that simply confirms her starting stance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to reimagine this entire civilization") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her interiority reads as abstract philosophy rather than character-particular thought: "Revival meant creation, not replication" is thesis-speak, not the syntax of a mind under pressure. The amber bottle "responding to her thoughts" and the cove transforming without visible cost or trade-off flatten agency into magic-wand passivity. No micro-choices with felt consequences anchor her arc; the ending grants her purpose fulfillment without foreclosing a path or requiring sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to archive emotional patterns is stated clearly but remains abstract—she never faces a concrete on-page choice where this desire conflicts with another want or imposes visible cost. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "velvet disquiet") and the climactic moment—speaking in the dead language—feels declared rather than earned through prior struggle. The backstory about the third-grade field trip anchors present action minimally; it provides context but doesn't tilt a present choice with micro-cost. Internal contradiction is absent: she moves smoothly from discovery to decipherment to resolution without competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of borrowed time") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her journey reads as a prophetic unfolding—grandmother's whispers, creature's bond, vortex unlocking—without genuine internal conflict or cost. "Furiously tranquil" remains a label applied at the opening without constraining or enabling later action. The final embrace of responsibility arrives without visible foreclosure of a competing desire or path.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to favor listening over noise") is clear and his curiosity is credibly on-page, but his interior remains abstract through much of the piece—"strange connection," "felt a strange warmth"—rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The final choice (pulling the rope with purpose) is set up but arrives via atmospheric pressure rather than a prior dilemma that forces trade-offs. The label "credibly curious" appears as a descriptor rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. No second on-page character creates relational pressure, so the protagonist's arc stands alone without status dynamics or secondary friction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira's motivation remains abstract throughout—"spiritually curious" is label-only and never constrains a choice with visible cost. The lantern triggers her movement but she never faces a meaningful decision; she simply follows coordinates and receives insights passively. The final "understanding" is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("quiet pride," "primal elegance") and therapy-speak ("flourishing stillness") without embodied emotion or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is presented through labels rather than contradictory impulses in action—"astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive"—without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. His decision to perform the ritual feels unmotivated by prior struggle; the ghosts' appearance and the covenant's demands are accepted without internal friction or credible resistance. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("profound sense of peace," "inexplicable pull") and therapy-speak abstractions rather than character-particular perception. The final transformation from recluse to guardian lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths; he simply completes a task and feels peace.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a functional placeholder whose task is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "profound sense of purpose" at closure reads as label-only emotion without embodied cost or visible foreclosure. Thaddeus appears as pure exposition vehicle; his trembling hands gesture at emotion but his interiority never complicates the beat. The "ancient pact" and "borrowed-time" premise are asserted without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete is articulated but not tested under meaningful pressure; she arrives already possessing the insight she's meant to discover. The wanderer serves as a convenient mirror rather than generating genuine internal conflict—his arc from loss to reminder happens too smoothly without embodied struggle. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("her heart full") and the final exchange feels like mutual validation rather than earned transformation with visible cost. The protagonist's agency at closure is more observational than decisional, limiting felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a static vessel for the theme rather than a character whose contradictory impulses drive the action. The six-month diagnosis is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible struggle—he works "gently systematic" with "brazen calm" throughout, qualities that function as labels rather than embodied traits under pressure. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the orchard transformation proceeds frictionlessly. The final "smile" and closing eyes read as sentimental shorthand rather than earned endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's skepticism-to-awe trajectory is signaled but not earned through meaningful contradiction or on-page cost. Her "academically rebellious nature" and "luminous skeptic" identity remain labels without causal friction—no choice forces her to pay for that stance. The pilgrim encounter and amber placement feel passive; she observes and completes a circuit without foreclosing options or demonstrating what she risks by ascending. Interior voice leans generic ("quiet understanding," "questions she carried") rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    The coachman remains a static symbolic figure rather than a character with contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. His motivation is declared ("to let a garden reclaim a battlefield") but never tested or complicated by competing desires or tangible costs. The interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical musing ("a bridge between the past and the present") without embodied emotion or character-particular thought patterns. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; he simply executes his predetermined symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's baseline motivation (solitude versus curiosity) is established, but his interior life remains thin—we get "curiosity, long dormant, stirred" rather than embodied contradiction. The turn from retired isolation to active engagement lacks micro-choices that reveal cost; he simply agrees and proceeds. Lira functions as a convenient trigger rather than a pressure source, and the final smile ("a rare expression") tells emotion rather than showing the renunciation or endurance that would earn the shift. The piece gestures at internal change but never dramatizes the competing wants that would make his return to mystery work costly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior is abstract and label-heavy throughout ("gift that had branded them an outcast," "heart heavy with purpose"). The motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful choice or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost; the final stance—"quiet resolve" and "calling"—arrives as assertion rather than earned transformation. Embodied emotion is sparse; much of the interiority reads as summary or therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is stated ("promise of restoring the sky's rightful order stirred something deep within him") but his interiority relies on abstract phrasing like "sacredly playful nature" and "cautious abandon" without embodied contradiction. The chivalrous thief label never constrains a choice; he moves through the spire with generic competence. The chess game at climax is told summarily—"hours turned to moments"—flattening what should be the crucible of his internal conflict. The final revelation that the lid is a key, not a tool, arrives without visible cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to become the historian of small gestures") is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on stock constructions: "luminous absence," "kinship," "strange sense of liberation" function as labels without embodied particulars. The walk with Kael resolves her crisis-actor past through a single symbolic gesture with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Kael's "benevolently ruthless" trait is declared but never demonstrated in action or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to understand the shape of home") is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing—"mercury-glass seer," "fluid as her name suggested," "harmony of her fragmented self"—that substitutes poetic labels for embodied emotion. The climactic moment where she becomes "whole" is told rather than shown through specific action, and no visible cost constrains her final stance. The gift of "substituting reality nightly" remains ornamental, never shaping a choice or creating friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to forgive herself is declared but remains abstract; her interiority relies on stock formulations ("fierce repose," "desperate need") rather than contradictory impulses embodied in scene. The chess-tutor identity and fidgeting gesture are mentioned but never constrain a choice or reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The labyrinth sequence offers a handed epiphany ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey") rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; the tears and "weight lifting" at the climax read as asserted outcomes rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to reshape forgiveness is clear, but her interior remains generic—"longing," "heart pounding," "guilt and grief" operate as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The spire encounter never forces a micro-choice between competing impulses; she recites poetry and the environment responds without her wrestling conflicting desires in action. The final declaration "I am the shattered mirror" reads as epiphany-by-assertion rather than a choice earned through prior on-page struggle. Backstory is minimal, but the interiority at peak beats defaults to therapy-speak ("wound I choose to heal") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is declared but her interior contradictions never act simultaneously in scene—she trembles, examines, narrates in sequence without competing impulses. The final declaration "we are all broken" arrives as therapeutic abstraction rather than embodied cost. The charm-statue alignment feels convenient rather than earned through prior struggle, and no visible path is foreclosed with felt price. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "sense of peace") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("intimately aloof," "heart anchored in memories") rather than embodied contradiction. The promise premise is stated but never tested against a competing want on the page; she moves through discovery to painting without meaningful internal friction. The final shift—rejoining the world—is declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off or renunciation with cost. Embodied emotion is absent in peak beats; "hands trembled" and "heart lighter" are stock gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is declared but never tested through contradiction or cost. Interior states lean heavily on abstract labeling ("screaming tenderness," "vibrations of intent," "purify his doubts") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's appearance and cryptic statement feel convenient rather than emerging from Elias's agency. The final resolution—"his doubts" simply evaporating—lacks visible tradeoff or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is declared ("to navigate the geography of loss") but never tested through competing choices or genuine friction. Her actions are goal-directed—scavenging, building, adjusting—but these moves never face meaningful internal contradiction or embodied cost that would reveal hierarchy of values. The arrival of travelers provides satisfaction but no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Interiority remains abstract ("heart swelled," "sense of purpose") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias demonstrates consistent motivation (solitude, control) and his involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal friction. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("psychological safety," "fractured grace") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final choice to bury the eye feels more ritual-driven than earned by prior internal conflict. The progression from rational forager to superstitious participant needed sharper micro-choices that reveal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("gaps—unexplained absences, missing pieces") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The stranger's borrowed memories are told rather than dramatized through Elias's choices; his investigation yields discovery (journal, boot print) but no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "strange sense of peace" arrives without internal friction or trade-off, reading as resolved epiphany rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined largely by labels ("empirically intuitive," "lonely") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His acceptance of the guardian role arrives without visible internal resistance or cost—he moves from bewilderment to purpose in a single paragraph. The final transformation ("no longer lonely") is asserted rather than earned through specific on-page choices that foreclose other paths. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("felt a surge of purpose," "weight of the promise") instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    The queen's motivation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "disenchantment" remains a label without internal friction; the vow to "restore the balance" arrives as a tidy epiphany with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("weight of her people's deeds settled upon her") and the final transformation reads unearned because no on-page choice forces her to sacrifice a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to capture the density of presence") but never tested by contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction. The supposed "scientifically romantic pursuit" reads as label-only; no on-page micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Kael exists as a convenient audience, supplying trust and curiosity without applying opposition or forcing a trade-off. The final "transformation" is asserted ("they had done more than capture a moment—they had transformed it") without dramatized cost or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to distill chaos into narrative is clear, but her internal contradiction—envying past selves while seeking integration—resolves too smoothly without genuine cost. The epiphany ("You just forgot how to see it") arrives via dialogue oracle rather than earned struggle; the shift from jealousy to gratitude lacks the friction of a difficult choice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final writing moment feels declarative rather than a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is present but skews toward label-only emotion ("trembling calm," "deep-seated motivation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The core choice—reaching for the screw and offering interpretation—lands without visible cost or foreclosed path; Mira's tears and Elara's smile feel like therapeutic validation rather than a decision under pressure. Backstory (loss of smell) is integrated but remains abstract; the trait doesn't constrain a concrete on-page micro-choice that alters present options. Mira is functional but passive, serving as a delivery mechanism rather than applying immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior state is traced through embodied details (trembling fingers, caught breath). The crystallizing quill functions as an external marker of stress, but the emotional arc relies heavily on told introspection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation from fear to peace reads somewhat swift and tidy, with the scars reframed through reflection rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (the overdue apology) is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during the key beat. The grandmother relationship exists only in memory; no on-page friction tests commitment. The "induced currents" method and metaphor-advising trait are labels without visible constraint or cost. Internal state relies on abstract phrasing ("threads fraying," "weight of an overdue apology") instead of specific, embodied choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    The witness remains an abstract cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is declared ("unravel cosmic illusions") but never tested through conflicting wants or costs; the character observes and processes rather than deciding under friction. The "wanderingly exact" attribute appears as a label without constraining any on-page action. The ending transformation ("they were not just a witness but a participant") is asserted, not earned by prior causality or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias pursues a philosophical quest but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("essence of time itself") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The discovery of the parchment delivers a tidy epiphany without prior dramatic struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final peace feels declared rather than earned through on-page choices that alter his stance with friction. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (seeking answers about her father) but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious yet deeply pragmatic"). The subway-scrawl method is told rather than dramatized—we never see her actually interpret one in real time with micro-choices that reveal character under pressure. The final realization feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; she simply decides contradictions are guides without visible cost or forfeiture that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's interiority is consistently rendered through his relation to the phone booth, the disc, and his cultivated distance. The final call shows a meaningful shift earned by the night's events. However, the callers remain abstract voices without distinct embodiment, and Eli's epiphany about "teaching endings how to begin" arrives through reflection rather than a hard choice under competing pressures. The disc-playing moment feels more symbolic discovery than a decision with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (preserve small moments) is clearly stated but remains abstract; her "investigation" unfolds through discovery rather than constrained choice. The meeting with Mara provides backstory but no visible tradeoff—Elara listens and documents without internal conflict or cost. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("heart swelling," "profound connection") and the final choice to document is a continuation, not a transformation earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. The "desperately jocular" trait appears only as a label without constraining action. The transformation at the end—meeting versions of herself—feels unearned; no prior beats establish internal contradiction or genuine struggle that would make this communion credible. The moon rock functions as a passive talisman rather than an object that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "navigate uncharted emotional depths" is asserted but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The interiority defaults to abstract label-speak ("joy, sorrow, fear, love") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization—"the uncharted emotional depths she sought were not outside her but within"—is an unearned epiphany delivered wholesale rather than earned through struggle. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values or force a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "confidently uncertain" label appears twice but never constrains an actual decision with visible cost. Interior life reads generic at key moments ("strange comfort," "weight of history") without character-particular embodiment. The pen-writing action unfolds without internal contradiction or competing impulses that would earn the ending's passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains an abstract cipher throughout—her "whispering advisor" role is told rather than embodied through concrete micro-choices, and her charisma is declared ("drew people in without them realizing it") but never dramatized on the page. Interiority relies heavily on summary ("she thought of all the moments she'd lived") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final "triumph" lacks visible cost or meaningful foreclosure; she simply "found her voice" through assertions rather than earned causality, and no relationship crucible exists to test her motivations since she stands alone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The arsonist remains a cipher—motivation is declared ("rescue a forgotten promise") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience is absent; we observe only external movement through rooms. The "analytically intuitive mind" is a label without on-page demonstration of what that costs or enables. Tears at the scroll feel unearned because no prior interiority established emotional stakes or what this promise means to them personally.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation shifts abruptly from victim to weaver of dreams without earned causality. The "quietly rebellious" trait is asserted in paragraph one but never constrains a choice—her drumming is described as grounding, yet she shows no rebellion on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; she processes complex epiphanies ("entangled memories weren't a curse; they were a bridge") with therapy-speak clarity during peak emotional moments. The final transformation ("no longer just a guinea pig—she was a weaver of dreams") summarizes rather than dramatizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's gift of recognizing walks is label-only; it identifies Mira but never constrains a choice under pressure. The motivation "to prove whispers travel farther than shouts" crystallizes mid-story but remains abstract—no visible micro-choice trades subtlety against force. Mira's walk descriptions ("confident, almost taunting," then "softening") substitute for embodied contradiction. The key-turn at the wall is unmotivated by prior interiority; Eli's hesitation dissolves without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    The guardian operates primarily through label-only interiority ("spiralingly calm," "silent empathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The stranger's emotional arc—from despair to hope—unfolds through summary ("they spoke of loss, of regret") without dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final lightening reads as declared rather than earned through on-page cost; we see no specific path foreclosed or concrete price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to "plant forests of second thoughts" remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. His ability to "hear unspoken words" is mentioned but never shown constraining or enabling a specific on-page action with cost. Interiority relies on generic phrases ("felt an inexplicable pull," "sense of pride and accomplishment") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. No genuine internal conflict or visible cost appears; the ending declares success without forecloses a path or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to find freedom in embracing her true nature") remains abstract throughout; the "guarded heart" she locked away is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The moment she "lets go" and the barrier dissolves reads as passive reception rather than a choice with visible cost—no action is foreclosed, no competing good sacrificed. Embodiment is present in the opening ("calloused hands"), but the climactic beat relies on therapy-speak ("detach—from her fears, her doubts") and the final "combative tenderness" is asserted rather than enacted through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to cultivate lightness in grief") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her whittling and internal monologue remain mechanical and abstract—"The knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes"—without embodied emotional specificity or a visible trade-off between contradictory wants. The brother's loss is summary-only backstory that primes the ending but does not create on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final resolve ("a quiet resolve hardened") is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains an abstraction throughout—"aesthetically driven" and "cloud-shadow" are labels without grounding action or contradictory impulse. No micro-choices dramatize values under pressure; the protagonist simply absorbs sensations and recites without internal conflict or embodied cost. The final "breathless" and "heart full" are asserted emotional states rather than earned through struggle. The piece lacks the character-particular interiority and flawed agency required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to find beauty in imperfection") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices under pressure. His "innocently cunning" trait is told via exposition ("He had always been innocently cunning") rather than shown through embodied contradiction or trade-offs on the page. The concertina awakening moment feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; Elias's decision to "use the concertina as a tool for his next barter" lacks visible cost or struggle. Interiority leans on abstract summary ("He began to see his colorblindness not as a limitation") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to discover the texture of connection") but remains abstract and never dramatized through contradictory impulses or cost. Her journey through sounds is entirely passive—she listens, feels, realizes—with no on-page choices that forfeit anything or test competing values. The climactic moment ("felt a sense of purpose") is a label-only epiphany delivered via summary rather than embodied action. Interior voice relies on thesis-like abstractions ("balance between innovation and humanity") that feel imposed rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's grief is embodied through her workbench actions and the traced stencil, but her interior remains static across most beats—subdued throughout without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tattoo moment reads as externally triggered (curtains glow, stencil pulses) rather than emerging from her own wrestle between yearning and resistance. The final "renewed determination" arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternative path; she simply returns to work with confidence she "hadn't felt in years," which feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "steadily curious" trait is shown through her actions (reverse engineering the past, studying cards, measuring influence), and her collaboration with Mira creates a meaningful relationship under pressure. However, the characterization relies heavily on telling rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene—she moves smoothly from solitary work to collaboration without internal friction. The final moment ("patterns can be reversed") reads as thesis statement rather than earned insight through dramatized cost. Mira's transformation from exhausted victim to awed witness lacks embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared but her choices feel predetermined rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The kneeling gesture and whispered word are micro-choices, but the pagoda's response feels like a reward for patience rather than consequence of a risky decision. Internal experience remains abstract—"anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia"—without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization that "the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than one forced by visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("drawn to the moments when day surrendered to night," "uncovering the forgotten") but her interior life relies on abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic decision to "metamorphose the shadow" arrives without visible cost or trade-off—she presses stone to vial and achieves transformation through assertion rather than struggle. Embodied emotion is minimal; phrases like "luminous regret" and "heart alight with luminous regret and unwavering hope" label feelings rather than dramatizing them. The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality, more thematic wishfulness than earned character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interiority consists largely of abstract reflections ("layers of naivety, layers of fear") rather than embodied perception under pressure. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; instead, she arranges tools "with purpose" and places the tail tip on a shelf in gestures that feel symbolic rather than conflicted. The chameleon con and its impact remain entirely off-page summary, denying the reader any dramatized wound or recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("closure seeker" and "to learn to read the stories in scars") is declared but never dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The telepathic connection with plants and the coffee-ring examination are label-only traits—mentioned but not shown constraining behavior or forcing trade-offs. The final "scars on her soul began to fade" delivers an unearned epiphany via assertion rather than embodied cost. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("closure," "wounds," "buried truth") without character-particular texture or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—finding where unused love is stored—is poetic but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or embodied cost. Her "trembling hands" and final sense of purpose are gestural rather than specific to her psychometry practice. The decision to take the film strip feels inevitable from the start, with no genuine internal resistance or trade-off visible on the page. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("the weight of each letter") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira remains abstract—a collection of poetic traits rather than a person making choices under pressure. Her "gift" of hearing unspoken words is declared but never constrains a decision or creates friction; she simply listens and rests. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration") and the backstory childhood memory is inert, adding atmosphere but no present cost. No meaningful choice or endurance with visible consequence appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's motivation ("to cultivate the sparks") is declared but never encounters genuine friction or choice cost. Her interior consists largely of stock fantasy-register phrasing ("otherworldly light," "fragments of hope") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The archive sequence unfolds as a series of received actions (sand guides, clock hums, jars reignite) rather than decisions that foreclose paths. The final "understanding" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eamon's motivation remains abstract throughout; his "void" and search for "insight" are labels rather than embodied needs with contradictory pulls. The translocations are told-only—he "would wake" disoriented—never dramatized with micro-choices under pressure. The ending declares clarity ("he understood then") without showing what internal cost or foreclosed path this understanding entails. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("labyrinth," "wild frontier of your mind") that sounds diagnostic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to leave "the life she thought she wanted" remains abstract; the "unused courage" concept is labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice—punching the air and accepting the star stamp—lacks visible cost or forfeiture; the leash metaphor is told ("The leash had broken weeks ago") without showing what was renounced. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weight of their footsteps in the air") and the epiphany arrives unearned, declared rather than built from on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is often abstract ("to embody stillness," "to weigh the price of tranquility") rather than grounded in embodied contradictions. The nerve-regeneration backstory and his decision to "remain" are told without dramatized friction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. The final choice—to play and become "keeper of truth"—feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; the surge of knowledge replaces earned internal conflict. Diagnostic label-speak ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") sits on the page as claims rather than behaviors under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to unmask the pretender is declared but her internal contradiction or hierarchy of values never surfaces under pressure. The pretender's final collapse feels unmotivated—no prior scene shows Elara constraining their options through specific choices, only vague messaging. The confrontation resolves via a symbolic gesture (the ink pellet) rather than earned character cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart quickened") without embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on reflection and abstract wondering ("why some paths disappear") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her tapping habit is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction. The final realization feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she assembles information and arrives at insight without visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "curiosity grew" and "her mind drifted" instead of physical contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is declared early ("to discover meaning in the mess") but her interiority leans on stock phrasing—"awkward confidence," "strange energy," "thunderous serenity"—rather than embodied contradiction. The vision sequence tells us what she sees rather than showing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her decision to reignite the rebellion emerges from a mystical download rather than dramatized internal conflict; the cost of her new resolve is asserted ("the quiet confidence") but not enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interior defaults to stock phrases ("heart lighter than it had been in years") and therapy-speak ("cherished and feared"). Her discovery of plant telepathy and decision to use the embryo lack embodied contradiction—she moves from one declarative stance to another without simultaneous competing impulses. The guard encounter offers a micro-choice, but his instant capitulation removes pressure before it can test her values. The final walk with the embryo feels asserted rather than earned by prior internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zara's motivations are clear—she seeks peace and processes trauma through art—but her internal experience leans heavily on therapy-speak labels ("somatic markers" as survival mechanism, "pearl of stillness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic slip on the cliff offers a genuine physical stakes moment, but her epiphany ("quiet strength within her") arrives through assertion rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final sketching scene shows agency, yet the weight of her decision feels predetermined rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior arc tracks through metaphor-laden reflection, but her transformation relies heavily on telling rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's wisdom is invoked as external validation rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional progression leans on therapy-speak constructions ("luminescent ache," "necessary darkness") that abstract rather than embody. The final ascent reads as resolved insight without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is present and her pursuit is coherent, but her emotional progression relies on stock phrases ("anger…burned deep within her," tears welling) rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's death functions as setup but never creates a genuine on-page choice between competing impulses; her anger transforms into "something quieter, more resolute" through revelation rather than dramatized struggle. The woman's dialogue borders on therapeutic exposition ("It's a mirror. It reflects the moments we try to escape"), and Elara's final acceptance feels granted rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("bravely conflicted") is asserted repeatedly but never shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to access the network feels inevitable from the start, with no genuine internal opposition that would foreclose alternate paths. The phrase "bravely conflicted" appears as a label without embodied cost—she trembles, her heart races, but these are generic markers rather than character-particular manifestations of torn loyalty. The closure choice lacks visible sacrifice; we're told of "triumph and dread" but see no concrete price paid that alters her situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's pacifist identity is established but remains largely static; her acceptance of the blade feels unmotivated by prior internal conflict. The interiority leans toward soft labels ("her heart tightened") rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's arrival introduces relational pressure, but his function is largely expository; no meaningful status shift occurs between them. The final stance—"her father's legacy no longer defined her"—is asserted rather than earned through a visible renunciation or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("to catch that echo") but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. His "cool-headed" trait is label-only; no on-page contradiction or stress reveals interior complexity. The goddess arrives without Kael making a single decision that narrows his options, and the rail spike's "purpose now clear" epiphany is unearned exposition. Interiority relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("emotions transliterated") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor's motivation to discover hidden truths is clearly established, but her interior life reads more as summary than embodied contradiction. The trait "devotedly observant" remains largely label-only; we're told she notices telescope misalignment but don't feel the cost of that observational compulsion pressing against other needs. The final act of recalibrating a telescope feels symbolic rather than a choice forged from competing impulses, and the "orbits of regret" motif is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's guilt is stated but her internal contradictions remain flat—she stares at amber, tattooes, stares again without simultaneous pull and push. The decision to write letters as the lost child arrives without visible cost or embodied hesitation; the firmware "latches onto guilt" reads as metaphor-only machinery rather than character-driven pressure. The final freedom ("no longer steady but free") is declared rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a live path. Backstory dominates without micro-choices that tilt present stance until the letter discovery, pushing the opening third into orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's "whimsical" and "socially perceptive" traits are declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice. The motivation "to discover meaning in this chaos" remains abstract—no micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values or force visible trade-offs. "Lilac unease" is a label applied three times without physical manifestation or contradiction. The ending grants her "courage to stand in the mess" as an unearned epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is articulated through abstract label-speak ("gentle radical," "retrocognitively trapped") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied want/fear conflict. The mosaic work proceeds without visible internal friction or cost that would make renunciation credible. Interiority remains high-level summary ("she felt compelled," "she believed") instead of particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara is defined by label-only traits ("synesthetically blessed," "encore-seeking") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The duplicate character (the young woman who is "a version of herself") creates confusion rather than pressure—her despair is asserted through stock descriptors ("eyes hollow as if she'd seen the end of all things") rather than particular choice under constraint. The transformation happens through prop magic (the coin's color shift) rather than earned internal reversal. Therapy-speak intrudes at the peak: "intertwine the past and the future, create something new" reads as diagnostic self-awareness no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("affection for humanity," "skepticism was her shield") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The night-long work montage tells us she moves with "somatic markers of intuition and memory" but never dramatizes a micro-choice under pressure where cost is visible. Emotional states are labeled ("unease," "hope") without embodied contradiction; the geode becomes a passive talisman rather than a decision point. The final smile and determination arrive without foreclosing a live option or revealing a hierarchy of values through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to map emotions is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life relies on abstract labels ("curiosity was piqued," "profound connection") rather than embodied contradiction. The fossil triggers emotional flooding described generically ("joy, sorrow, longing") without character-specific texture. The final chamber scene asserts purpose without a visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies on generic mystical diction ("deliberate grace," "quietly inspired") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is asserted but never dramatized through conflicting impulses—she proceeds smoothly through her task without genuine struggle or trade-offs. The bone-button discovery triggers a surge of connection described in abstract terms rather than specific sensory or emotional cost. No visible renunciation or choice forecloses a path; she simply completes her work and walks away with "heart full."

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("fixing what's broken," "find where unused courage waits") is declared but never embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory dominates without anchoring micro-choices that alter present options—being "burned" and "cautious" is told, not shown through competing desires in scene. The pill and letter pivot feel unearned; no prior dramatized struggle makes her final realization credible. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("courage felt buried, unused") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    The coachman's motivation is declared but never tested under pressure; he sits, listens, and receives an answer without meaningful internal conflict or choice. The figure's appearance and departure are passive events happening *to* him rather than decisions he makes. The closing realization ("not an answer but a way of seeing") reads as unearned epiphany rather than knowledge won through struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("distill complexity into essence") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract throughout; her "zen-minded" trait functions as a label rather than shaping contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from personal curiosity to community teaching arrives without visible internal friction or cost—she moves from solitary potter to village instructor in a single paragraph with no dramatized resistance. Interiority relies on summary ("she felt a connection," "deep sense of peace") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The glass's glow provides external feedback but Elara's choices never narrow options or foreclose a path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early ("to reflect light into dark corners") but remains largely metaphorical label rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The lockmaster arrives with matching lantern carvings—convenient symmetry that flattens agency; she passively receives validation rather than making a costly choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability" function as labels without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final exchange offers mutual recognition but no visible cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation ("translate isolation into independence") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her internal state remains abstract—"brittle determination" and "reincarnation memory" function as labels without embodied conflict or micro-choices that foreclose options. The orb integration at the climax feels passive; she receives visions and power rather than making a choice that reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. Therapy-speak ("coexist," "embodiment," "bridge between the extinct and the eternal") in the final beats replaces on-page emotional cost with meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is asserted ("to find the thread that connects all things") but never tested through contradictory impulses or meaningful choice under pressure. Her "inevitably whimsical nature" reads as label-only; no on-page action demonstrates whimsy constraining a decision. The placement of the spiral feels unmotivated—no dramatized stakes compel her to leave it, and the "profound sense of peace" arrives as summary rather than embodied cost. Interiority relies on stock spiritual phrasing ("invisible web," "tapestry") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "cautiously hopeful" stance is named rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her technical competence reads cleanly, but internal conflict remains thin—decoding the signal and activating the counter-frequency proceed without meaningful hesitation or competing desires. The ending asserts "grit" and "peace" rather than dramatizing a visible cost or foreclosed path; her decision to stay vigilant restates her opening posture without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and prudent adventurousness are stated but rarely constrain on-page choices with visible cost. The key moment—squeezing through the narrow passage—stages the fear but resolves it through abstract "embracing the mutiny" without concrete struggle or renunciation. Her father's disappearance provides backstory motivation, but interiority leans on label-speak ("her claustrophobia returned with a vengeance") rather than embodied sensation that drives micro-choices. The final smile and "wistful rebellion" feel asserted rather than earned by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's face blindness is stated but never constrains a live choice—she simply "focuses on intent" without dramatized cost. The methodical trait appears as label rather than embodied tradeoff. The figure encounter generates no micro-choice that tests her stated motivation; she kneels and sketches without internal friction. The final "shift" and "lighter heart" are asserted emotional payoffs unearned by prior struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "nervously confident" trait appears as a label without constraining choices; the final decision lacks visible cost because her great-uncle's appearance and the ritual resolution arrive through exposition rather than internal struggle. The spongey dread is asserted but not embodied in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart quickened," "voice steady despite her fear") rather than character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Bridge-Song remains abstractly conceived—"dynamically observant" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices. The fiddler's journey feels propelled by external clues (the glass flake, scaffold wraps) rather than internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Motivations are declared ("to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") but never dramatized through competing impulses or visible cost. The hitchhiker exists only in summary, undercutting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is perceptively calm in label but not enacted through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure. The encounter with the father's former partner offers a potential moment of tension, yet Elias's response ("This place has already been stripped of its worth") reads as assured platitude rather than embodied struggle. Interior access drifts into summary ("his mind working like a puzzle solver") and therapy-adjacent epiphany ("some paths circle back, not to trap us, but to teach us") instead of specific, flawed perception. The final closure—walking away at peace—lacks visible cost or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete choice with cost. Her "gift to heal with words" remains entirely label-only; no scene shows her using it, failing at it, or paying a price for it. The epiphany "about acknowledging the burdens she had carried in silence" arrives without prior dramatization of those burdens or any micro-choice that earns the shift. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("fractured memories," "shared vulnerability") without embodied contradiction or a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's motivation to discover what mirrors don't show is established, and her internal conflict about a past failure surfaces under pressure. The "frozen confession" moment where she admits "I failed" feels somewhat rushed—the weight of her guarded nature unbending lacks sufficient embodied buildup across prior beats. Her warlike serenity is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation reads as resolution but the cost (what path is foreclosed) remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to find the intersection of dreams") remains abstract throughout; her choices feel predetermined rather than wrestled from competing impulses. The "root-bound visionary" and "purposefully curious" traits are label-only, never constraining an on-page decision with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("anxious elation," "heart raced") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The scars glow in sync with the clipping but function as magical plot tokens rather than markers of genuine struggle that shape present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to mend souls is clear and consistent, but her "reckless idealism" is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to stay carries weight, yet the confrontation with her shadow-self feels abstract rather than embodied—"fiercely gentle" appears as label rather than constraint. Internal contradiction is present (sacrifice vs. self-preservation) but doesn't act simultaneously in scene; it alternates in dialogue with the figure rather than complicating a single high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is established through backstory and reflection rather than present-scene choices that reveal character under pressure. The interiority leans heavily on therapy-speak ("insulating himself emotionally with facts," "wracking his brain," "confidently uncertain") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens rather than embodies emotion. The final "realization" that purpose must be created feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Internal contradiction is largely absent; he moves from stated emptiness to stated hope without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eliara's motivation is clear—haunted ambitions driving her search—but interiority relies on stock phrasing ("mix of fear and excitement," "sense of completion"). The pivotal planting moment lacks embodied contradiction; she moves from hesitation to action without visible competing impulses. The final fruit-plucking reads as epiphany delivered rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. "Haunted ambitions" appear as a label without showing what specific fear or failure drives her forward.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" is stated early but remains largely abstract; her internal contradiction never manifests as simultaneous opposing impulses in scene. The climactic pool sequence offers descriptive interiority ("sharp mind," "strange sense of peace") but lacks embodied tension or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The realization about identity as "process" arrives as philosophical summary rather than earned struggle, and the final satisfaction reads tidy—no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("her heart sought something deeper") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The pearl scene shows her touching and examining but not making a difficult choice with visible cost—she simply follows the pull. The transformation at the end (recognizing herself as "a bridge, a conduit") arrives as an unearned epiphany without prior internal conflict. Emotional progression is abstract and therapeutic ("her motivation crystallized") rather than embodied and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior motivation (self-forgiveness) is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The medication backstory and accordion-as-vessel device remain largely ornamental exposition rather than generating on-page micro-choices with visible trade-offs. The encounter with the acquaintance offers a brief external pressure point, but his wisdom-dispensing role feels convenient rather than earned through prior relationship tension. Embodied emotion is minimal; most interiority reads as summary ("raw ache of unfiltered memory") rather than specific perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"veiled dreamer" functions as a label rather than a person with embodied contradictions. Her motivation is declared ("cautious exuberance," "to find her answer") but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost; she moves through the library without friction or choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "burned brighter") and the final smile bypasses the struggle required to earn transformation. The watch chooses her, removing agency from the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied pressure. The "accidentally telepathic with plants" trait remains label-only; plants whisper urgent commands ("Propagate. Protect. Prevail.") but never constrain her choice or create friction. The final action—drawing the bow—feels unmotivated by prior interiority; we see no internal struggle, no micro-choice that reveals competing values. The "mulberry ache" is repeated as a placeholder emotion without embodied specification, and the Dominion scouts freeze conveniently rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "capture one last spark" is declared but never dramatized as a genuine internal conflict with contradictory impulses. Her shift from seeking sparks to embracing stillness reads as an epiphany delivered by the traveler rather than earned through on-page struggle. The traveler's resurrection and subsequent teaching role feel convenient, undermining agency. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("tremor in her soul," "lucidly watchful") without embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation remains abstract throughout—yearning she "couldn't name" and a quest for "contentment" never translates into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The betrayal mention is pure backstory with no on-page cost or micro-choice that alters present tactics. The lake vision sequence lists prior lives in summary rather than dramatizing a choice under pressure, and the final "whole" declaration is an unearned epiphany grafted onto passive reception of visions. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "quiet unrest," "heart quickened," "warm embrace."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is presented entirely through labels—"conscience for hire," "sincerely insincere"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Mara remains off-page throughout; we are told she is "sincerely insincere" and wrapped in doubt, but no on-page choice dramatizes her struggle or tests her under pressure. The final act (sealing the letter with the shard) is Elias's alone and carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("welcome nuance into certainty") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("felt the weight of her mission") and therapeutic self-awareness ("a reckoning with her own carefully woven lies") rather than embodied contradiction. The backwards-aging premise remains ornamental; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates how living in reverse pressures her present actions. Her final decision to reveal the truth arrives without visible cost—colleagues are mentioned in reflection but never appear to challenge her, so the forfeiture remains asserted rather than dramatized. The motivation "to teach vanishing to appear" functions as a thematic label recycled across beats without showing what specific trade-off Elara accepts by speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout; "their resolve was as unyielding as the stone" tells rather than dramatizes through contradictory impulses. The mission ("appraise through bird patterns") is stated but never tested by conflicting desires or cost—Kael simply waits, observes, receives understanding without friction. Emotional progression is flat: "heart swelled with understanding" at the reveal operates as pure summary. No embodied contradiction or hierarchy of values emerges under pressure; the protagonist functions as a passive receptor rather than an agent wrestling with flawed judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's motivation is declared but never internally complicated. His "longing" for the keystone and desire to prove manual magic's worth remain static labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The keystone's touch delivers an unearned epiphany ("the sacred could be found in the simplest of acts") that reads as thematic summary, not a discovery earned through prior causality. No visible cost forecloses a path; he simply returns to "a world where his methods would still be considered outdated" with newfound belief—Earned Stasis requires on-page sacrifice or renunciation, which is absent here.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the color of sound" is declared rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The key tag functions as a prop that pulls him forward without internal resistance or cost-laden decisions. His "wandering purposefully" and final vow arrive without prior struggle that would make renunciation or commitment meaningful. The character reads as a conduit for thematic declarations rather than an agent forced to trade competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation is declared ("to wavelength align with purpose") but remains abstract throughout; the phrase functions as a label rather than an embodied desire with competing costs. Her "quietly enthusiastic" trait appears only as stage direction without constraining choices. Internal experience consists largely of summary ("her mind drifted," "she wondered") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "smile" and "beacon of hope" read as performance rather than earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's heartbreak over a lost soul is established but never tested by an on-page choice that forces contradiction or cost. Her interior is filled with elevated abstractions ("crystallize their essence through scattered light") that read as thematic glosses rather than embodied thought under pressure. The naming act at the end feels declarative rather than earned through struggle; no visible trade-off emerges between her grief and her newfound purpose. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the friction and micro-choices that would demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eliard's earnest naivety is established early but operates mostly as a label rather than creating contradictory impulses in scene. His devotion to the bell-repair feels more like programmatic execution than a choice that costs him something immediate—the task proceeds methodically without visible internal conflict or a meaningful renunciation that forecloses a path. The embodied emotion is thin: "heart swelling with hope" and "hands trembling" are generic tags rather than character-particular sensation. The final stance shift (feeling purpose) arrives without a dramatized struggle that would earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior is largely absent; his "precisely humane" trait and "quiet compassion" are asserted but never tested through contradictory impulses under pressure. The journey unfolds as observation and gentle curation rather than forced choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "harmonize logic and intuition" is told rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "midnight pattern seeker" remains abstract throughout—no biographical anchors, no embodied contradictions, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("attentively inventive mind," "unwavering focus and creativity") without character-particular texture. The seeker's climactic understanding arrives as assertion rather than earned through visible struggle or trade-off. Muscle memory and the parachute buckle are told as important but never dramatized in a choice that costs.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "fractured sense of identity") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist remains passive through most beats—Lira hands them swords, the brain responds autonomously—with no micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final merger is declared ("The brain was not a duplicate to be fought over but a part of them to be embraced") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Therapy-speak pervades peak moments without dramatized embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eli's motivation is clear—restore lost laughter—but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("mournfully eager," "desperate attempt") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

The final smile is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("dimensionally homesick" / "make friends with uncertainty") reads as label-only rather than embodied contradiction. The closing choice to wait lacks visible cost on the page—no on-page forfeiture of an active opportunity, only a passive deferral. Interior monologue leans toward abstraction ("foggy lucidity of her thoughts settled into clarity") rather than concrete, character-specific perception under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("sorrow," "ache") rather than shown through action or physical tell.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's arc from "hopeless alchemist" to creator is present but relies heavily on sudden clarity ("the penny drop") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior experience leans toward therapeutic self-awareness ("stoically sensitive, her emotions buried beneath layers of failure and disillusionment") and the final shift feels asserted more than earned through dramatized micro-choices. The frozen bloom functions as an emblem rather than a lived constraint that forces visible tradeoffs. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("hands trembling") but much of the interiority reads as summary.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara reads as a cipher for theme rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her interiority is stock ("her heart steady," "strange sense of peace") and her epiphanies arrive unearned—she simply realizes assumptions are wrong without dramatized cost or resistant thought. The moment she "discarded that assumption, too" (paragraph 5) is told summary, not embodied struggle. No micro-choice forecloses a path; she moves frictionlessly through insight to insight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract—"discover the texture of connection"—and never crystallizes into a concrete want tested by cost. The shadow-man's question momentarily poses internal conflict, but her resumption of weaving feels automatic rather than earned by contradictory impulses. The childhood memory anchors backstory to present action, yet the final choice to continue weaving lacks visible tradeoff; we're told she "knew her work was far from over" without dramatizing what path she has foreclosed or what competing desire she has sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("balancedly curious," desire to reclaim direction) but rarely tested by contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's claustrophobia is declared but never meaningfully constrains her choices—she "pauses" once but immediately "presses forward" without cost or tactical adaptation. Her motivation ("stand by the unremembered," debt to Dr. Voss) is told in exposition rather than tested through competing desires or embodied hesitation. The vault sequence offers no micro-choices that reflect her stated fear; she simply "steels herself" and proceeds. Internal contradiction is absent; she operates as a competent agent moving through obstacles rather than a character whose flaw shapes her path.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's internal life is largely absent; we see her positioned as defiant and determined but never experience contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her realization about the shell and synchronization arrives as declarative insight rather than embodied struggle—"It was then that she realized" bypasses the messy cognition of discovery. The statues crumble conveniently without forcing Elara to renounce anything or face a visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains label-only: "beauty" and "defiance" are asserted but not dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation (finding where broken promises heal) is established through backstory, but his on-page choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted. The sister's disappearance provides context, yet we see no internal contradiction during the mission—he executes his plan smoothly without meaningful hesitation or cost to his values. The "respectfully rebellious" trait is labeled but never tested; no moment forces him to choose between respect and rebellion with visible consequences. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart heavy with hope and sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carpenter's motivation is clearly signaled, and his silence adds character specificity. However, the transformation at the climax—suddenly singing with a voice he doesn't have—feels unmotivated; the text claims "his voice had been stolen" yet he sings without any dramatized struggle or cost to reclaim it. The emotional arc from silent craftsman to singer lacks the interior contradiction and embodied friction required at this length. The halo fragment's warmth and the carousel's response are told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)

    Elara's interiority is abstract and stock throughout—"cipher of longing," "weaver of stories"—with no embodied emotion or contradictory impulses in scene.

Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weight of her motivation," "scars badges of honor") without character-particular contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is assigned multiple abstract roles ("weaver between worlds," "guardian of the unseen threads") but these labels remain ungrounded in concrete contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and her internal restlessness creates some tension, but her emotional arc proceeds smoothly without genuine contradiction—she moves from task to resolution without internal conflict forcing difficult trade-offs. The backstory about her mother's broken mask (~15% of text) anchors in the present but doesn't tilt a live choice; it contextualizes rather than complicates. The final "mending herself" realization feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("heart heavy but at ease") and the spirits' resistance dissolves without forcing Elara to sacrifice anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to interpret silence with empathy") but never tested by a competing impulse or dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated and her analytic trait shapes her approach, but her interior experience remains somewhat distant—she observes and reflects more than she struggles with contradictory impulses.

The sailor functions as backstory rather than live pressure, and the ending epiphany feels declared ("she realized") rather than earned through a tangible sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is elaborately furnished with poeticized emotion ("quietly explosive," clouds as emotions) but her actual choices under pressure remain thin.

The "return" to the gondola with string repaired feels like a soft reset that clears stakes without dramatized consequence. Interiority leans heavily on atmospheric assertion ("she felt it in her bones") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)

    Elara's curiosity is asserted repeatedly but her micro-choices under pressure are thin—she follows a beam of light without genuine internal conflict or cost. The phrase "diligently curious" and "sociable isolation" are label-only descriptors never embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Captain Thorne's disappearance is told backstory that doesn't tilt present stakes through an on-page micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation—learning "the rhythm of repair"—remains abstract throughout; the phrase is repeated but never grounded in a concrete, on-page micro-choice that reveals what it costs her to pursue it. Interior life leans heavily on stock metaphor ("her heart pounded," "her breath visible") and philosophical generalization ("the interconnectedness of all things") rather than embodied contradiction. The hall-of-mirrors visions gesture at internal conflict (younger, older, broken, whole) but are summarized rather than dramatized as live pressure that forces a decision. No visible mistake or renunciation with felt cost anchors the final "newfound confidence."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by contradiction or cost; she orchestrates from a distance without friction or sacrifice. Kael and his allies remain undifferentiated stock helpers—botanist, sculptor, musician—whose micro-choices are entirely cooperative.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "vouchsafe a future" is asserted but not grounded in concrete choices under pressure. The puppet-mending shows physical engagement, but internal contradiction is absent—she doubts briefly then commits without visible competing impulses.

Embodied emotion is present in "fingers trembling," yet the resolution arrives through passive patterning rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to guide travelers is asserted early, but her internal contradiction between hating the role and staying is told rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. The decision to use the nut-map feels prompted by the nut's pull rather than arising from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final planting carries a sense of earned action, but the causal chain leading there reads more as discovery than as a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority leans on abstractions ("stubborn sense of duty," "faint hope") rather than character-particular textures.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interiority leans heavily on abstract processing ("symphonically attuned," "weave the pieces together") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grief is declared and reflected upon but never dramatizes competing impulses in real time—she moves smoothly from observation to insight without friction. The final choice to "climb out" arrives as narrated summary rather than a moment where two wants collide with visible cost. Micro-choices are absent; the transformation is told rather than earned through on-page struggle.

The final decision to "hide no more" arrives as assertion without visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply leaves with the invitation in her pocket. Thaddeus functions as exposition-delivery rather than applying immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") but her interior remains generic label-speak without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The planting action never encounters resistance or cost that would reveal character under pressure. Her emotional state is described ("sense of peace") rather than dramatized through perception shifts or bodily response. The discovery of the plaque feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation driven by a need to conjure meaning—but the character remains somewhat static until the transformed slide forces a shift. The "gently meticulous" trait is told more than shown through specific micro-choices under pressure; her stepping closer "against her orderly nature" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallization (preservation → connection) is legible but arrives through external revelation rather than earned internal conflict. Interiority leans toward abstract ("edge of oblivion") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's interior motivation is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. She moves through the market with steady resolve, but her actions read as competent maneuvering rather than genuine struggle—the confrontation with the thieves is won through verbal assertions ("I've been playing this game my whole life") without visible cost or a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The watch fob functions as a prop rather than an object that forces a difficult trade-off. Her backstory (father's trade, growing up in this world) is told efficiently but does not anchor a present micro-choice that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her choices never force meaningful internal conflict. The "luminous skeptic" trait remains decorative; her skepticism dissolves without resistance when confronted by the cloaked figure. The final decision to "follow the ring" lacks visible cost or foreclosed options—she simply accepts the call. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("paradox that defined her very being," "turmoil within") rather than embodied contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to break free is stated clearly, but her interior process lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The discovery of the forgotten self-portrait provides external permission rather than wrestling with internal resistance on the page. Her transformation reads too smoothly—trembling hand to steady hand without visible friction—and the "wild-eyed" painting offers therapy-speak epiphany ("You were meant for more") rather than embodied struggle. The final choice feels declared rather than earned through dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's gift (gilded leaves that wilt near dishonesty) creates an interesting constraint, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("felt the weight of silence pressing on her") rather than embodied contradictions. The final choice to inscribe the conversations feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—we're told "she understood now" without witnessing the micro-choices that lead to that understanding. The calligrapher occupation remains ornamental; we never see her crafting process constrain a decision under pressure in the present timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a static archetype—the contemplative artist—without contradiction or vulnerability that complicates her stance. Her "seasonally mute" trait is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice or creates friction. Interior life consists of abstract belief statements ("she believed it contained the purest form of truth") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to descend is unmotivated by prior struggle; she simply completes her task and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to resolve inner static is present, but her choices feel more programmatic than earned through contradictory impulses. The miniaturization sequence shows agency, but the emotional cost—losing nostalgic memories—is told rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal what she's sacrificing in the moment. The "fragmented wholeness" operates as a label rather than a lived contradiction that complicates her decisions under pressure. Internal conflict remains abstract ("static," "dissonance") without specific embodied sensation or competing desires acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clara's motivation to uncover stories is stated but her interior life remains generic—"her heart quickened" and "emotion swirling within her" are label-only. The decision to open the mailbox lacks embodied hesitation or contradictory impulses; she simply inserts the key when given one. Mrs. Ellis delivers exposition rather than applying pressure through a relationship crucible. The final realization ("she had found a purpose") is an unearned epiphany, not a choice that forecloses a visible path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented through abstract labels ("lyrical code breaker," "calm defiance") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her interior life remains opaque; we see choreographed movements but no contradictory impulses or stakes-driven decisions that foreclose options with visible cost. The dice and journal function as props she manipulates, not constraints that force her into dilemmas. Her triumph is declared ("surge of triumph") rather than earned through a choice that reveals her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eli's motivation to recover deleted memories is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The wildflowers and whale function as symbolic tokens without constraining an on-page choice. Interiority relies on abstract yearning ("clarity," "hope") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final "smile" and "understanding" read as unearned epiphany without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("profound sense of peace," "weight of her responsibility") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her motivation to "smooth the hush" is declared but never tested by a credible on-page obstacle that forces a trade-off or reveals internal contradiction. The summoner's competence proceeds without genuine struggle or blind spots; she completes the ritual smoothly, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending's sense of accomplishment is asserted rather than earned through causality that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to understand the building's language is present but remains abstract; her micro-choices (tightening hand around seal, accepting Elias's presence) show caution but lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Elias functions as a cipher delivering exposition rather than a character with agency—his "patiently nimble" trait is labeled but never dramatized in a choice with cost. The final knock with sugar in hand reads as mechanical completion of instruction rather than an earned shift that forecloses a path; no visible price paid on the page beyond mild social discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's "charmed skeptic" stance is stated but not dramatized through micro-choices; her skepticism dissolves instantly upon touching the shell with no visible internal friction. The interiority relies heavily on abstracted emotion ("achingly familiar," "heart raced") rather than embodied sensation. The figure's insight ("your isolation has made you strong") lands as unearned epiphany—there's no prior scene work showing how isolation constrained her choices or what cost she paid to reach independence. The final transformation into "independence" is declared, not demonstrated through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to forgive is clearly established, and the rose thorn as a tool of emotional release grounds her interiority. However, the moment of transformation feels too smooth—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; instead, the forgiveness unfolds as a linear, contemplative process. The father's betrayal is told rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final choice lacks visible cost beyond the metaphorical weight-lifting. Embodied emotion appears in "hand trembled" and "weight lift from her chest," but these remain somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance feels asserted ("felt a sense of peace") without visible cost or dramatized struggle—no foreclosed path appears on the page. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("richly perceptive mind sifting through layers") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The seashell and figure are props rather than pressures that force micro-choices with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to salvage something pure") but not tested by on-page friction or contradictory impulses. Her actions—examining, placing, focusing, whispering—read as unobstructed ritual without internal conflict or meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The character feels more like a conduit for atmospheric set-dressing than a protagonist whose flaws or desires generate complication. Emotions are labeled ("heart quickened," "tremor in her chest") rather than embodied through contradictory physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a static philosophical figure whose interior life is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "scintillatingly somber" presence and "demure audacity" are asserted labels without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The whistle and tea whisk handling offer gestural moments, but no genuine internal conflict emerges—she contemplates patterns without cost, arriving at peace through reflection alone. Motivation is abstract (appreciate hidden effort) and never tested by a choice that forecloses a live option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—excavating truth—is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her interiority relies on label-speak ("sharply observant," "intuition told her") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to reinforce the seal feels convenient rather than earned by prior micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply sits back exhausted with the diamond "now just a stone."

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains abstract—a "lonely visionary" label recycled without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His climactic choice to "activate the portico" lacks embodied hesitation or visible cost; the visions flood his mind in summary rather than forcing a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Interior language leans on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "trembling hands") and the final smile is described as "bittersweet" without dramatizing what he has renounced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("translator between generations") is declared but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Interior life is abstract and label-heavy ("positively wistful," therapy-adjacent phrasing like "redemption for lost voices") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The grandmother memory functions as backstory decoration; it seeds no present micro-choice. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("felt whole") without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect the key is declared but her "logically emotional" nature reads as label-only; the warring impulses never manifest as contradictory action in scene. The confrontation beat shows her wavering ("her resolve wavered") then instantly recovering with no visible cost or trade-off—she simply channels the key's power to win. Interior language leans on therapy-speak ("logically emotional devotion," "warring within her") without embodied contradiction. The figure's reveal and Elara's final stance feel mechanically resolved rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; we're told she seeks to "sculpt patience from impatience" but never see her struggle with her own impatience in scene. The internal transformation is summarized across paragraphs ("she began to unyoke herself") without embodied cost or a visible choice that forecloses a path. Secondary characters arrive as abstract "visitors" without distinct pressure or resistance, flattening the relational crucible. The final sense of completion reads as assertion rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared but her internal conflict with her mentor remains abstract throughout. The journal discovery prompts forward motion, but her emotional reactions feel labeled rather than embodied—"her calm faltered for a moment" telegraphs state without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "she felt free" and smile are asserted outcomes rather than earned through on-page cost; we see no micro-choice that forecloses a specific path with the mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal resolve forms clearly through concrete sensory anchoring (handling the clockwork heart, wandering the shop), but his shifts remain largely contemplative rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transition from doubt to resolve is signaled but never tested on-page with a visible cost or difficult micro-choice that forecloses a path. Thomas exists only in reported exposition, flattening what could be a crucible relationship into backstory summary. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("quiet resolve forming," "the weight of his task") dilutes specificity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to create the yearning algorithm is stated but her interior remains surface-level throughout. The "steadily curious mind" is label-only; we see tinkering but no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle when the algorithm stabilizes. The arrow tip functions as a talisman symbol but never constrains a choice or forces a trade-off. The breakthrough and bell-ringing feel declarative rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation—finding deleted files—is stated but never dramatized through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her "brightly attentive" attribute is label-only; no scene shows the cost or tradeoff of this trait. The decision to "lie" and continue investigating offline appears abruptly without prior internal conflict, and the final choice to "expose the truth" lacks visible cost on the page—it reads as declaration rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and stated ("to map empathy onto action"), but her interiority reads generic and abstracted. The "shadow-laced peacekeeper" trait is mentioned but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the crystal ball feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; we see her processing reflections but no visible cost or foreclosed path that would validate the change. Embodiment is thin—"weighted breath" is the sole physical marker in a story that spans significant emotional terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's core motivation—witnessing endings—is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The conversation with the man about "the sound of it coming" offers a reflective beat, but her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The parasol functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a choice-shaping object. The final "weight lift" and "grip tightening" read as asserted resolution without prior on-page struggle that would make renunciation or acceptance feel earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("mismatch," "understanding," "space between") rather than embodied contradiction. The moment she traces the charred edge offers concrete grounding, but the epiphany about embracing mismatches arrives through summary rather than a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. Internal conflict is stated ("too practical for dreamers, too passionate for pragmatists") but never dramatized as simultaneous impulses acting in scene. The final shift feels declared rather than earned by prior causality that altered her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested by a competing desire or meaningful cost. Her "strangely honest nature" appears as a label without constraining a single choice. The consecration unfolds without friction—no hesitation, doubt, or price paid—making the climactic act feel like ceremonial busywork. Interior life consists of abstract reverence rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and personal (factory loss backstory), but her interior remains abstract and distant throughout. The work consists entirely of arranging photographs without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "perceptively calm demeanor" and "intuition honed through years" are told labels rather than embodied choices under pressure. No credible cost forecloses a path; she simply completes her task and leaves "lighter than it had been in weeks" without on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation to decode the crystal is clear and sustained, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("weathered innocence," "respect for the power of language") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to walk away with the spent crystal feels more like graceful acceptance than a decision that costs him something specific on the page. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal; he hums, scribbles, and observes without internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined primarily by the "precognitively forgetful" label, which is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation to "capture the sound of growing older" remains abstract; we see wandering and marking but no genuine internal conflict or hierarchy of values tested under pressure. The final moment—hearing the sound and releasing the chalk—reads as convenient arrival rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclosed paths. Embodied emotion is present in physical gestures (kneeling, brushing surfaces) but interiority leans on poetic abstraction ("tidal longing," "prism for the future") without character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is declared but never tested through competing desires or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final success arrives without visible friction or renunciation—she simply works through the night and achieves her goal. The "luminous ache" and fulfillment arc reads as emotional summary rather than embodied cost; no micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and she pursues it consistently, but her competence is nearly frictionless—she knows "exactly what each patient needed" and executes without meaningful struggle. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through the story as a serene conduit rather than a character under pressure. Mrs. Bennett and Claire's reconciliation unfolds through Elara's facilitation, but their interiority remains thin, reducing the emotional stakes to a managed outcome rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains largely abstract ("quietly deliberate" is told repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory impulses). The final choice—activating the key—feels mechanically executed without embodied emotion or visible internal conflict during the climactic moment. Her mentor's disappearance provides backstory weight, but no on-page micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The workshop scene shows some embodied connection (fingers brushing the automaton), but peak beats lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "forgiving skeptic" stance is asserted but never tested on the page—she questions legends yet immediately commits without internal friction. The motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" appears as poetic tell rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The guilt over her friend's substitute body is introduced late and remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with visible cost. The symbolic stone drop feels like therapy-speak ritual rather than a genuine renunciation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira's motivation (to share light without using fire) is clearly rooted in a childhood trauma and drives her present action. However, the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction—her calm focus on polishing never wavers, and no competing impulse tests her commitment. The final walk to the village feels like fulfillment rather than a choice with visible cost. The backstory exceeds ~30% of the text but remains anchored to present stimuli (the sea glass, the grotto's mist) and interleaves with micro-choices (beginning to polish, holding the glass up), so BRR does not cap here.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is clearly stated and drives her garden-tending actions, but her interior life relies heavily on abstractions ("honeyed hush," "watchful dreamer") rather than embodied contradiction. The confession backstory is told rather than dramatized, weakening the stakes of her vulnerability. Kai's arrival produces micro-choices (the pendant touch, the notebook exchange) that feel genuine, but the final shared sitting lacks a foreclosed path or visible cost—it reads as mutual comfort rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested through escalating choices. Her "conflicted nature" toggles between generic impulses ("part of her wanted to turn away... another part yearned") without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final writing moment is declared ("she found her peace") rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("her fear of failure, her doubt") and label-only emotions without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by a genuine obstacle or cost. Her internal experience consists entirely of stock embodiments ("heart swelled with hope") and therapy-speak epiphany without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation arrives without struggle or trade-off—she simply succeeds because the narrative wills it, making her arc feel ornamental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her actions are described with patient precision, but she demonstrates perfect competence without blind spots or mistakes that could compound. The character remains a vessel for prompt elements rather than an individual whose flaws and contradictions drive inevitable consequences. Interior experience consists largely of craft-procedure summary ("She hummed a low, melodic tune") without embodied emotion or pressure-driven micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") is presented as label rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. His "peripherally focused" trait and locksmith occupation appear as told attributes without constraining choices or revealing hierarchy of values through micro-decisions. The "years of practice" and humming tune function as generic competence markers rather than embodied particulars that emerge under the specific stress of this repair. Emotional progression remains smooth and declarative ("felt a sense of peace") rather than layering contradictory states through credible irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior texture leans heavily on abstract concepts ("fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "calcified within her") rather than embodied contradiction. The encounter with the figure generates some pressure, but her final "choice to understand" arrives without visible prior struggle or micro-choices that test competing impulses. The dialogue exchange shows thematic positioning more than character-specific friction. No genuine cost forecloses a path on the page; the weaving shift at the end is gestured toward but not dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her relationship with the carving is embodied through physical work, but her interiority relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shift from grief to peace feels more contemplated than earned through on-page struggle; her carving progresses smoothly without genuine setbacks or micro-choices that foreclose paths. The lion metaphor does accumulate meaning, but the final "resilience" realization reads as stated insight rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara's motivation to "negotiate with her own ghost" remains abstract throughout; the ghost is defined as "a shadow of her eroded ambitions" but never dramatized as a choice-forcing pressure. Interiority relies on therapeutic summary ("regret clung to her like a second skin") rather than embodied contradiction. The camera wheel's voice offering wisdom feels like an external solution rather than a choice Mara earns through prior struggle, undermining agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's motivation is stated ("puzzle out new equations for hope") but remains abstract throughout; his choices—opening vents, propping mirrors—feel illustrative rather than pressured by internal contradiction. The "stoic wonder" and transformation proceed smoothly without visible cost or foreclosed paths. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("functionally creative mind began to turn") and the final realization arrives as an epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and the final choice to complete the clock demonstrates agency with visible cost. However, the protagonist's journey reads as primarily reflective rather than pressured by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the abandoned dream feels more thematic frame than embodied contradiction. The motivation to complete her father's clock arrives through whispers and memory rather than forced by present-scene friction. Backstory dominates (~35% of text) but anchors via concrete cues (crystals, petrichor, the blank clock face) and primes the final choice, meeting the reflection-led exception test.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("understand the architecture of lies") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her walk along the canal and discovery of the journal unfold without internal conflict or embodied stakes—she simply finds what she seeks. The final moment ("stood tall") asserts transformation without showing what path was foreclosed or what competing desire she renounced. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("her heart ached," "felt it in her bones") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared clearly (preserve ancient knowledge) but never tested or contradicted on the page. Her "infinitely patient" trait is merely asserted through description rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure. The piece offers no internal conflict—she traces knots, experiences a moment of understanding, and succeeds without visible cost or renunciation. The final smile signals triumph without any path foreclosed or trade-off made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The traveler's interior work is present but remains abstract—"to write obituaries for the living" and "understand the geography of healing" function as declarative labels rather than embodied contradictions. The encounter with the elderly woman offers a glimpse of witness-as-action, but the traveler never faces a consequential choice that costs her something or forecloses a path; she observes, writes, and departs unchanged. The woman's transformation is told through tears and thread-exchange rather than dramatized through resistant micro-choices. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("geography of healing," "monument of hope") in reflective passages weakens specificity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("reawaken beauty") but remains abstract throughout. His decisions—descending, assembling the machine—lack embodied hesitation or competing impulses; the assembly proceeds mechanically without visible cost or doubt in the moment. The "bitterly sweet" realization and final "quaking reverie" are labeled emotions rather than contradictory pressures acting simultaneously. Internal conflict is summarized retrospectively ("his heart sank") instead of dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established (atonement evolving to transformation), and the interior work is embodied through her physical actions with the sand and seeds. However, the characterization leans on abstract declarations ("spark of unyielding compassion," "heart hardened by whispers") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to plant seeds feels thematically apt but lacks a visible on-page cost or foreclosed path—she simply tries, hopes, and feels peace without evident sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is labeled "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" but these traits never constrain choices or create internal contradiction. Her journey from skepticism to wonder occurs through passive discovery rather than conflicted decision-making. The box's testing ("demanding she prove her worth") is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Her transformation at the end—"no longer just a luminous skeptic"—is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains abstract throughout—"otherworldly sentimentalist" with "weight of generations" reads as label-only characterization without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of therapy-speak ("profound connection," "delicate balance") and diagnostic self-awareness ("she realized," "she understood") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "discovery" is asserted rather than earned through prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. Motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" remains abstract; her journey is contemplative but lacks on-page internal contradiction or meaningful resistance. The mentor's spectral guidance operates as backdrop wisdom rather than a force creating genuine friction. The final realization—"not something to be solved but something to be carried"—reads as unearned epiphany, delivered through reflection rather than dramatized struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies from duty to broader purpose, but the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("incremental absolution," "searing reverie") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from winder to "keeper of time" feels declared more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The fisherman and baker moments are summary gestures that tell us about change rather than showing Elias wrestle with competing impulses in scene. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending grants peaceful resolution without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "understand stories hidden in threads" is clear but largely static; his sustained focus across hours shows endurance rather than a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interior remains abstract—"his mind alight with the possibilities"—lacking embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Backstory about the grandfather and the general love of "unknown threads" primes the work but doesn't tilt present stakes through a micro-choice. The ending closure ("a connection to the past that would forever shape his intentions") is declared rather than earned through a dramatized change or renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ignorance Cartographer remains a concept-label rather than a character with embodied interiority. His trembling hands are mentioned, but internal contradiction—groundedly imaginative versus fearful—never dramatizes as simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene. The transformation from stagnation to innovation is declared through metaphor ("the air seemed to shift") rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost: he walks away with a scroll, smiling, having "begun to live" the future without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is established, but her interior life remains shallow—she experiences excitement and determination without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The decision to "cloak herself in mystery" and transcribe the lyrics lacks meaningful cost or competing impulses; she simply proceeds methodically. Her copyist profession is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character-specific perception under pressure. No micro-choices foreclose paths or reveal hierarchy of values at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated but never tested on the page; she moves through the gallery with reverence but makes no difficult choice. The task is presented as already decided, and the scattering unfolds without internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on abstract claims ("weary," "grief and beauty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The rocking chair and mask are observed, not engaged as crucibles that alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's motivation to preserve ancient methods is stated but rarely tested in scene—he polishes the cog, clutches it, follows Lira, then collects more artifacts without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The "abrasive calm" and "rationally rebellious" labels are asserted repeatedly ("his abrasive calm," "rationally rebellious mind") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Lira appears functional but one-note; her scavenger role and "defiance" are told, not shown through distinct speech or pressure-driven choice. The final realization—"competing narratives…were not opposites but threads in the same tapestry"—arrives as an unearned epiphany, summarizing theme rather than emerging from prior dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") rather than embodied contradictions. The students remain generic; no individual voice or resistance emerges to test her commitment. The final "victory" arrives without visible cost—she clings to her premise throughout, and no path is foreclosed. Internal conflict is asserted in the opening but never dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's memory-tasting gift is introduced but never constrains a choice or creates friction—it's decorative rather than instrumental. Her motivation ("create something beautiful from the ruins") remains abstract; the story tells us she wants to spark rebellion but never dramatizes competing impulses or a visible trade-off. The grandmother's pruning wisdom is invoked twice but functions as thematic echo rather than a contradiction Elara must navigate under pressure. Internal conflict is summarized ("doubts") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "involuntarily truthful" trait is label-only; it never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. Her motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, and her descent into the chamber meets no internal resistance. The final "smile" arrives unearned, a tidy emotional resolution that skips the struggle required at this length. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "trembling hands") rather than character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains an abstraction throughout—"inadvertently profound," "attuned to subtle shifts"—but we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. His "sanctifying" of objects is told rather than embodied; we watch him arrange and murmur, but no visible cost forecloses a path. The climax ("he felt a difference") is assertion without dramatized struggle or trade-off, and the final walk past whispering houses is summary rather than choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's telepathic observations create consistent interiority, but the statue's core motivation remains abstract—"guardian of nuance" functions as a label rather than a dramatized want with cost. Elara's arc from certainty to caution is sketched but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene; we get alternating summary states instead. The final "gratitude" arrives weeks later via telepathic report, diluting embodied consequence. Micro-choices exist (Elara tightening her hand, deciding to test further) but feel more illustrative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is heavily labeled rather than embodied—"grim optimist," "balancedly daring" appear as declarations without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The mentor backstory and dice symbolism feel ornamental; they're told rather than used to drive micro-choices under pressure. The final realization ("not something to capture but to let go of") arrives as epiphany without prior dramatic contradiction forcing it. Emotional progression is summarized through abstractions ("the rupture had occurred...within her") rather than shown through embodied perception and credible irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") but never tested through concrete choice or contradiction. Her "methodically hopeful" trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the tension between hope and her insomnia's toll. The painting sequence unfolds without meaningful internal conflict—the brush "guides" her hand, erasing agency. The final calm arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is asserted rather than tested under pressure—she leads tours, worries about tradition, and executes a plan that succeeds immediately without credible friction. Internal contradiction is absent; her "rosewater dread" remains a label rather than embodied tension. The climactic bread-baking resolves too smoothly, with the community gathering and laughing on cue, foreclosing no path and incurring no visible cost. The protagonist reads as a vehicle for thematic delivery rather than a mind wrestling contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established and his actions remain consistent with his counter-clockwise rebellion theme. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("neatly inventive mind," "bleak exhilaration") rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment of trembling hands and racing mind gestures toward cost but doesn't dramatize what specific path has been foreclosed or what competing impulse he's suppressing. No secondary character pressure tests his commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Clara's motivation to confront fear is stated but not embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her interior reads as label-heavy therapy-speak ("unbosom your fears," "fear of being forgotten") rather than specific, character-particular thought under pressure. The final choice—confronting fear by acknowledging it—feels abstract and unmotivated by prior micro-decisions; no visible cost forecloses a path. The shadowy advisor remains a voice-device without pressure dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leeward remains more archetype than individual; his motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is declared repeatedly but never contradicted or complicated by a competing impulse. The restlessness mentioned at the opening vanishes without dramatized internal friction or cost—he simply plays and achieves peace. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart full and his spirit at peace" labels rather than enacts the shift, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's quiet drive is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her descent into the tunnel and approach to the pedestal proceed without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The mentor backstory occupies significant space but functions primarily as setup rather than tilting present choices through micro-decisions. Embodied emotion is thin; reactions to the watchers and the living shell remain externalized description rather than contradictory feeling acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her "emotionally rational" trait remains largely a label—she "dissects feelings" but we see no on-page contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her archive discovery proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal conflict or choice under pressure. The final "deeper understanding" feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and her peace at the end arrives without visible foreclosure of a path.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life is rendered through label-heavy phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "hushed blaze of anticipation") rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation to become "the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is told and reiterated but never tested by a competing desire or cost on the page. The moment he finds the journal and decides to continue the repairs lacks internal friction; he simply "resolve[s] harden[ing]" without visible tradeoff. The transformation from surveyor to dream-keeper is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("trace honest origins") is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or trade-offs. Her interiority relies on label-only phrasing ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The stamp's significance is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final chamber discovery lacks visible cost—she simply reads text with no foreclosed path or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clearly established—grief transformed through craft—but his interior life leans heavily on abstract labels ("luminous torment," "hollow," "mockery of his pain") rather than embodied contradiction. The revelation that "the shadow that had detached was not a piece of his soul, but a shield" arrives as a declared insight without prior dramatized tension between competing impulses. The final choice to "honor" rather than "escape" grief feels thematically legible but lacks micro-choices under pressure that would demonstrate genuine internal conflict. Lira's presence applies external pressure but remains primarily advisory rather than a crucible forcing tough trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zara's motivation is clear and her journey from survivor to seeker tracks, but her internal conflict remains abstract. The awakening feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Epiphanies arrive through crystal-gazing contemplation without the visceral struggle or micro-choices that would earn them. The final shift to "seeker" reads as a label rather than a transformation paid for with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's "perpetually surprised expression" is mentioned three times but never constrains a choice or creates meaningful internal contradiction. His motivation to "decode the frequency of belonging" remains abstract—never dramatized through embodied conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The pilgrim and matrix chip serve as quest tokens rather than pressure points that force Kael to sacrifice anything on the page. The final "quiet resolve" is asserted, not earned through prior struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt is clearly established and embodied through physical gestures (clenching the watch, trembling legs), and his profession as a forger of lineages creates authentic internal contradiction. The final choice to "stop adding to the lies" represents genuine renunciation with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis ("the guilt gnawing at him like a relentless tide") and the epiphany arrives through symbolic driftwood rather than dramatized human pressure, which weakens the earned quality of his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared through exposition rather than tested under pressure—her "uncommonly thoughtful nature" exists as label and mentorship memory, not lived contradiction. The climactic exchange shows no visible internal conflict between competing impulses; her choice to offer the drawer pull arrives smooth and pre-decided. Kael's arc—from wounded pride to tentative agreement—lacks embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing desires. The final handoff feels like symbolic ceremony rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular in places (tracing the compass, kinship with poles), but the motivation shifts between internal reflection and action without micro-choices that visibly constrain later beats. The "align heart and actions" goal remains abstract; we see her paddle away, but the choice doesn't foreclose a path with felt cost—she simply tucks the compass into her pack and continues. Embodied emotion appears ("chest pressed," "legs wobbling"), yet the peak moment of releasing the compass dependency reads more as summary relief than as contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "merrily melancholic smile" acknowledges complexity, but the smile itself is labeled rather than enacted through specific gesture or bodily contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("clean slate seeker," "jaded wonder," "kindle empathy") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His decision to drop the baseball and wade in reads more contemplative than conflicted—no visible cost forecloses a path. The final stance ("empathy… something to carry") arrives via reflection rather than dramatized choice, and the "procedure" remains vague enough that his agency feels attenuated.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to reforge a bond beyond death") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The guardian's wisdom arrives as expository gift rather than earned insight, and the climactic "metamorphosis" pivot—realizing the bond is with herself—reads as therapeutic epiphany delivered via dialogue rather than embodied struggle. Internal states are labeled ("her heart ached," "sense of purpose") without the contradictory simultaneity required for high-band characterization. The final choice lacks visible cost: she simply accepts the revelation and walks away smiling.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her internal contradiction remains abstract—"willingly perplexed" functions as a label rather than embodied ambivalence. The nephew memory provides emotional weight, but the decisive act (shedding the brooch, pressing the saucer) lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply receives a vision and resolves to return. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("weight of her absence like a stone in her chest") and the epiphany arrives via magical revelation rather than earned struggle. The final promise feels declared rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is characterized primarily through abstract labels ("pacifist," "steadfast resolve") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her emotional progression from "gravity of sorrow" to "gravitationally lighter" to "heart raced" reads as告示板 states rather than embodied struggle. The "stitching" action functions metaphorically but never reveals a micro-choice hierarchy or internal conflict that would make her final step back into the ship feel earned. Therapy-speak intrudes at key beats: "shadow work—confronting the darkest parts of oneself to find the light within" is diagnostic exposition that flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") remains abstract throughout; her choices feel guided by external mystical forces rather than earned internal contradiction. The "whispering hush" orchestrates her detour, reducing agency to passive following. The bottled lightning bug release at climax reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path—she walks away "lighter," with "spirit renewed," a soft emotional reset. Interior voice relies on therapy-speak ("profound sense of connection," "state of being") and stock epiphany language that flattens particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's actions follow a clear goal, but her "calmly inventive" nature is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The mentor backstory and her knowledge of the cradle arrive via exposition rather than earned discovery. The final choice to activate the cradle feels undermotivated—Thorne's hesitation provides no genuine obstacle, and Elara's risk calculus remains abstract. Internal conflict is largely absent; she proceeds without visible doubt or cost to her certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation (understanding sacred patterns) is consistent and drives his actions, but his interior life remains abstract and declarative. The precognitive curse is told rather than shown constraining choices; we see visions mentioned but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "understanding" feels like an unearned epiphany delivered through exposition ("The sacred patterns were not just in the eels or the stars; they were in everything") rather than dramatized realization. Embodied emotion is minimal—no sweat, tremor, or breath patterns under the high-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("cartography of scars") is told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. The final decision to write "uncensored" arrives without visible cost or a prior scene showing what censorship actually foreclosed. Interior states are labeled ("furiously tranquil," "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The envelope-opening beat lacks agency—Elara passively receives and reads rather than making a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("turn questions into destinations") is declared but never embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The mechanical arm is mentioned repeatedly but functions purely as decoration—its servos whir and gleam without constraining or enabling any on-page decision. Mara exists only to trade abstractions; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion drives either character. The final "realization" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's "monthly molting" trait is label-only; it never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible friction. His motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" remains abstract—he writes poems and stands on rooftops, but no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or costs. Clara is functionally interchangeable; her backstory (the grandfather's letters) delivers exposition without altering her present stance. The ending declares permanence ("this self…was here to stay") without dramatizing the renunciation or trade-off that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is signaled ("steely longing," "strategically creative mind") but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from playing "for herself" to "with newfound purpose" lacks a causal trigger in her prior choices; the film reel delivers insight passively. The strategic plan and its execution remain ornamental—she follows compasses and loads a reel without meaningful resistance or cost that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization remains largely abstract—"empirically whimsical" and "reality checker" are labels never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The creature's riddle is answered with thematic summary rather than lived tension. The seed-planting decision carries no visible internal cost or foreclosed path; villagers exist only as background. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart steady," "her mind racing") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's slow-spoken trait and bonsai patience are declared but rarely constrain choices on the page. His motivation to find "the color of unspoken apologies" remains abstract; reading the letters aloud is the only concrete micro-choice, but it feels convenient rather than a struggle against an internal contradiction. The friend's vanishing and the regret are backstory summary without present friction. Emotional progression skips from weary to "lighter than it had been in years" without embodied cost.

    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final realization is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand the "cartography of scars" is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving the decision to open the envelope. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "trembling hands" and "furiously tranquil gaze," with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final choice to write is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of censorship with visible cost in confronting past scars. Minor abstraction in "rarefy" moment slightly limits peak emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in his mechanical arm's twitch. The final realization is earned through dialogue, but the arm feels decorative rather than constraining choices, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's molting personalities and motivation to forge beauty from anarchy are well-dramatized through concrete interiority and micro-choices, though the trait lacks deep internal contradiction in scene. Clara's quiet strength adds relational pressure, and their friendship forces choices that alter the library's state. The final permanence feels earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's grief and motivation are concretely embodied through the clock and piano; her strategic creativity drives the plot, and the final change is earned by the film reel experience with visible cost in the renewed playing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and consistent, driving her quest. Her interiority is somewhat abstract (e.g., "luminous doubt"), but micro-choices under pressure, such as answering the creature's riddle, reveal character. The final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, though emotional embodiment could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's slow speech and bonsai background consistently inform his patient, intentional actions; his motivation to find the color of unspoken apologies drives the narrative, and his final release of regret is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the dissolution of the letters.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and sensibility are clear and coherent—her work on neutron stars, attraction to the greenhouse, and desire to “strip away the needless drama” all align. However, her interior conflict is muted: she moves fairly smoothly from curiosity to awe without much contradiction or pressure that forces a hard choice. The final realization about transformation feels emotionally right but largely declared rather than earned through a tough decision. The character feels specific but not yet deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s craft, resilience, and motivation are clearly sketched, and her decision to retrace the smuggler’s path follows logically from those traits. However, her interiority leans on summary and abstraction (“Her motivation was clear…”) rather than embodied, character-specific reactions to danger and loss. Internal contradiction is almost absent; she rarely feels genuinely torn between impulses. The apprentice relationship, central to the stakes, remains emotionally underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to bridge the sonic past and silent present—is specific, coherent, and present from first paragraph to last. Her embodied relationship to the tuning fork and the heat-mapping device grounds her interiority in concrete action. However, her inner conflict is relatively smooth: frustration is mentioned but not sharply dramatized against competing impulses or moral costs. Kael functions mostly as a catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core drive (a weary undertaker compelled to “give rest a permanent address”) is clear and coherently expressed through his choice to rebuild and deploy the lens. His interiority has some texture—weariness, inadvertent stubbornness, faint solace in the “chased stillness”—but rarely shows sharp contradictory impulses under pressure. The final emotional shift (from burdened to relieved) is earned but a bit tidy, with limited sense of cost beyond fatigue lifting. Adding one beat where his compulsion clashes with fear or hopelessness would deepen him significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation and basic psychology are clear and consistent, and her actions (anonymous giving → public leadership) align with that throughline. However, she is rendered almost entirely as morally steadfast and selfless, with little contradiction or real flaw on the page. The emotional life is more summarized than embodied, especially at key turns (her decision to step into the moonlight, her acceptance of being the visible leader). The relationship with the widow is functional rather than pressure-bearing, offering little in the way of interpersonal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to resolve a past-life failure and locate “unused love”—and her actions track that motive. We get some embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath slowing), but her inner life stays relatively simple, with little genuine contradiction or irrationality under pressure. The climax gives her a large realization with minimal on-page struggle, so the change reads a bit easy. Relationships are entirely off-stage, which keeps her psychology somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s obsession with time and lost ancestry is clear and consistent, and her embodied responses (trembling, pull toward the fragment) give her some lived specificity. However, she encounters little genuine internal contradiction or resistance; once the fragment appears, she moves almost frictionlessly toward the pedestal. Her transformation at the end feels somewhat preordained and low-cost, more bestowed than struggled for. The characterization is solid but lacks the sharper, messier edges and conflicting impulses expected at a top literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The liberator’s goal and competence are clear, but they read as an archetype rather than an individuated person, with little contradiction or textured interiority under pressure. Emotion is often summarized in stock phrases (“eyes burned with a purpose”) rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic perception. Secondary characters are faceless “men,” so no relational crucible ever forms. The final “freedom” moment lands conceptually but not with a deeply earned, character-specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and emotional texture are clear and specific, and her sensory world (hearing colors) meaningfully individualizes her. However, her inner conflict stays relatively smooth—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk she might turn away from this quest. The final reframing of pain into beauty feels slightly tidy, with limited dramatized struggle in the moment. Still, her actions align cleanly with her motive and yield a credible, if gentle, change.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira has a clear longing and a competent, cautious surface, but her interiority remains fairly generalized (“her heart ached”) and she rarely feels genuinely under pressure. The switch from thief to anointed bearer of the jar happens quickly, with little on-page ambivalence or cost. Elara is mostly a delivery mechanism for exposition, with her grief and attachment to the jar stated rather than embodied. The final sense of “purpose” is more told than earned through contradictory impulses resolved in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (crafting “safe zones for inquiry” rooted in past silencing) are clear and consistent, and the bookmark/grandmother backstory grounds them personally. Her internal contradiction—control vs. abandon, fear of vulnerability vs. desire for openness—is legible and paid off in the final gesture. However, the emotional journey unfolds with relatively little on-page friction, and some language edges toward abstracted self-knowledge (“vulnerability,” “growth began”) rather than fully embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—reclaiming a stolen identity and proving vulnerability as power—is clear and consistent, and her interiority (phobias vs practiced bravery) is grounded in specific images like shaking hands and the seashell. However, moments such as “Vulnerability…was power. Proving that had become her sole motivation.” tip into declarative, therapy-adjacent summary rather than dramatized conflict. Her final shift in self-conception is earned but arrives a bit neatly, with limited sense of ongoing flaw or cost. The absence of on-page relationships or a concrete antagonist keeps her conflict primarily internal and slightly one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle’s motivation (mapping an endless night) is clear and consistent, and small choices—especially using the personal childhood story last—track with that drive. However, interior conflict is faint: the “mildly obsessed” trait never generates a real contradiction or visible cost, so the emotional range stays narrow. Embodiment is mostly externalized through setting rather than through the body. The final stance (quiet satisfaction, work ongoing) feels credible but not deeply earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Unit-7 has a clear core motivation and some interior life—its shift from “Unit-7” to “seeker” is conceptually strong. However, its emotional experience remains abstract and largely summarized rather than embodied (we don’t feel fear, doubt, or resistance). The epiphany arrives smoothly, without much dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. This keeps the character from feeling fully particular or from paying a visible cost for transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to thaw mistrust with Kian through risky honesty—is clear and consistently dramatized, and her hesitation versus desire for openness gives her a modest internal contradiction. Her embodied emotion (petrichor, tracing the ticket, doodling as proxy speech) feels specific rather than generic. Kian is thinner but still legible as a wary then softening counterpart. The shift from guardedness to tentative reconnection is earned, though the emotional cost lands on the gentler side.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by care for the garden and the marbles-as-memory project, and his interiority feels specific to an aging, stoic caretaker. The quiet internal contradiction—believing his work is futile while continuing faithfully—is credible. However, his emotional progression toward insight is fairly smooth and tidy, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage in the moment. The final realization lands, but at elite level we’d want more tension between impulses as he works and especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s core drive and personality (“icy warmth,” dismissed dreamer) are clear and consistent, and her key choices (pulling and then re-adjusting the lever) align with that motivation. However, her interior conflict stays relatively surface-level: there’s little on-page struggle between fear for the station and hunger to prove her theory. Embodiment of emotion is serviceable but generic—her calm feels asserted more than complicated. The final shift toward responsibility is plausible but not deeply earned through layered micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clara’s motivation—to decode the ghost-composer’s message and reclaim her own spark—is clear and consistent, and her musician’s sensibility gives her interiority some specificity. However, she encounters little genuine friction or contradiction; her attraction to “in between spaces” is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted choices. Emotional beats lean on generalized wonder and “pull” rather than sharper, character-particular reactions. The ghost, as a second presence, functions mainly as an icon rather than a pressure-bearing character.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and specific—her “fault-tolerant” relationship with truth and the felt jaggedness of this particular truth make her read as more than an archetype. The embodied details (smudging the page, feeling the station “breathe”) ground her emotional state well. The wanderer is thinner but still functions as a credible relational pressure. The final shift—accepting the truth as a seed and choosing to “occupy the margins”—is earned but perhaps a touch tidy, with limited sense of lingering flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motive (reckless explorer seeking the truth about her father) is clear and consistent, and her decision to press on despite fear tracks. However, her internal conflict between skepticism and budding belief is mostly told rather than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses on the page. The final choice to turn the valve feels emotionally plausible but almost frictionless, with little visible cost or hesitation at the peak. As a result, she reads solid but somewhat generic rather than fully particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s vocation and solitude are clear and particular, and her decision to follow the swan’s map arises plausibly from her role as observer of change. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: we’re told she “grips reality loosely” and seeks balance, but we rarely see sharply embodied contradictory impulses on the page. The transformation after the mirror—her deeper understanding of decay and rebirth—reads more as an asserted insight than a struggle we’ve watched her earn. A bit more dramatized ambivalence at the choice to leave the library or to engage the mirror would sharpen motivation and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly drawn—her calming, therapeutic instincts and use of the curl as a personal talisman feel coherent and consistent, and Finn’s fear-into-wonder shift is credible. However, both characters verge on archetypal “healer” and “awestruck child,” with limited contradiction or moral friction under pressure. There’s little sense of what it costs Elara to open herself or what she risks emotionally in this interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore dreaming and “collect the stories walls have heard”—is clear and consistent, but largely asserted rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. She functions as a competent chosen expert without real visible flaws or internal contradiction. Her emotional life is gestured at (“heart quickened”) but not embodied in specific, idiosyncratic ways. The change at the end (satisfaction, success) comes easily, with little sense of cost or risk borne by her character.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    Li Wei’s core desire—to pursue the lighthouse and “transpose” life into a new key—is clear, but it reads more as stated intention than dramatized inner conflict. Emotional texture is generalized (“surge of clarity,” “renewed purpose”) rather than embodied or character‑specific, and contradictory impulses (fear vs. longing, obligation vs. risk) never really surface. The micro-choices (continuing to write, touching the specs, deciding to go) are present but low-friction, with little sense of cost. As a result, Li Wei feels more like a function of theme than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The priest’s motivation and function are clear, but he reads more as a symbolic role than a fully individuated person. Interiority is almost entirely conceptual; we don’t feel conflicting impulses or embodied emotion, only mission-driven abstraction. His final “declaration” feels thematically apt but not earned through visible internal struggle. This limits the felt cost of his success.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The writer’s artistic drive and odd nostalgia are clearly motivated and consistent, and their small sequence of choices (writing on the shell, then activating the harp) feel character-rooted. However, internal conflict remains soft: we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses, just a generalized urgency vs. exhaustion. Emotion is often filtered through elevated abstraction rather than idiosyncratic, embodied detail, which keeps the character slightly archetypal. The final collapse carries cost but doesn’t feel like a hard, specific value trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core desire and fear are clear, and her emotional throughline (dread, awe, relief) is consistent, but her psychology remains generalized rather than deeply particular. Much of her conflict is told in abstract terms (“The darkness in her own heart stirred”) rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses. Her final acceptance feels somewhat too smooth, with little on-page resistance or visible cost. The alternate Elaras function more as illustrations of possibilities than as hard relational crucibles that force sharper choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and transformation are clear and specific, rooted in her deafness, craft, and emotional numbness, with the backward-song experiment emerging credibly from her desperation. Interiority is mostly well embodied through tactile and vibrational perception, giving her a distinctive way of experiencing the world. However, a few lines lean on generalized diagnostic phrasing (“Emotional numbness had become her constant companion”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction under pressure. The final shift into “raw, aching aliveness” is earned but could carry more on-page ambivalence or cost to deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a coherent core—meticulous, solitary, principled, and curious—and his choice to investigate at real personal risk is motivated and consistent. The solitude-vs-responsibility tension is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in specific embodied moments. Lines like “His curiosity, always credible, now bordered on recklessness” tell us his inner conflict instead of letting it leak through more idiosyncratic thought or action. The final shift (“integrity demanded action”) is believable but a bit too declarative to feel fully earned at a literary-mag level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is distinct—a cautious, grief-avoidant man whose relationship with scent is both emotional and behavioral—and his decision to finally open the vial feels motivated by accumulated pressure. His interiority during the visions is specific enough to feel lived-in (the jasmine-and-rain association, the hospital scene) rather than generic. However, his internal conflict stays relatively tidy: he hesitates and then yields without much on-page contradiction or self-deception in the moment of choice. The woman in the cloak functions as a catalyst rather than a character, adding little relational pressure once she exits.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and history are clear, and his interiority has some specificity (freedom vs. solitude, the rope as guilt and cost). However, his conflict remains largely conceptual, with few embodied, contradictory impulses under immediate pressure. The final act of coiling and relinquishing the rope reads smooth and lightly costly rather than jagged or hard-won. Strong but not yet at the ruthless, irreducible level this venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive (“seeking beauty in the unfinished”) is clear and governs her choice to play and then tell a story, and her acoustically focused perceptions give her some specificity. However, her emotional life is relatively smooth and unconflicted—hesitation yields quickly to fulfillment without much contradictory impulse or visible cost. The final realization about the hush feels earned but somewhat tidy, with limited complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly sketched—professional, meticulous, motivated by “insight with empathy”—and her actions align with those traits. The affectionate detachment and faint ache at the end give her some contradiction, but these tensions are lightly tested rather than forced into a genuinely difficult choice. Kael exists only as a projected psyche, so relational pressure remains abstract. The final stance (accepting half-truths as her workable currency) feels earned but low-cost, keeping this just below a truly standout character study.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her history with the locket and her attention to “silent contributors,” and her micro-choices (approaching the man, deciding to write, inviting Clara) track cleanly with that. However, her inner life under pressure feels too smooth—there’s little contradiction or real ambivalence when she risks breaching privacy and later risking an in‑person meeting. Clara is more a gentle presence than a fully realized counterforce in scene. The final sense of lightness around the locket is emotionally coherent but carries minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation (to belong after displacement) is clear, consistent, and plausibly drives her choices from arbor-obsession to the Echo quest. Specific sensory attention (her calloused fingers, marsh-reed craft) grounds her interiority. Internal contradiction—yearning for kinship but acting mostly via quiet, safe dedication—is present but under-dramatized rather than pressured in scene. Her final sense of belonging feels earned but reported more than embodied in a concrete, costly on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation (creative stagnation plus her grandmother’s stories) is clear and carries through, and her micro-choices (stepping onto the ledge, following the pull, descending) align with that. However, her internal conflict is minimal: she feels surprisingly little fear or doubt in the face of enormous, reality-bending events. The final realization about “honoring rhythm” is thematically tidy but comes without much on-page struggle. This keeps the arc from feeling deeply earned at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to mathematize emotion and resolve her mentor’s disappearance) is clear and consistent, and her actions follow logically from that drive. However, her inner life stays relatively tidy—there’s little dramatized contradiction between fear of danger and pull toward discovery, and emotions tend toward summary over embodiment. Her final stance (choosing harmony over control) is conceptually earned but not felt as a hard-cost decision on the page. More textured irrationality or visible hesitation at key beats would deepen her beyond an archetypal reflective mage.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crawl space dweller has a clear, consistent motivation and a gentle, coherent interiority, and the final realization about visibility grows logically from earlier beats. However, there’s very little genuine internal conflict—no palpable tug between safety of hiding and risk of being seen—so the choice never feels sharply pressured. Emotions skew summarized and abstract (“heart filled with purpose”) rather than concretely embodied. The closing shift is credible but arrives as a tidy affirmation more than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interior life is specific and credible: control as safety, curiosity about plant behavior, and fear of change are all clearly dramatized rather than merely asserted. Her arc from control to surrender feels earned by the accumulated focus on the leaf and the storm, even if some beats are summarized (“She knew what she had to do”). Contradictory impulses—need for control vs attraction to the leaf’s autonomy—are present but sometimes told in abstract terms instead of fully embodied. The lack of other on-page characters narrows the relational crucible, but for a solo piece the motivation and change are coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is clearly sketched—insomniac, self-deprecating, driven to “thresh meaning” from chaos—and her actions (following the rain, treating the brooch as a key, accepting the book) align with that. However, internal conflict is thin: she wants meaning and then simply moves toward it, with little hesitation or competing impulse on the page. Her emotional responses are mostly summarized rather than embodied (e.g., “Her heart raced” without deeper contradiction). The old woman functions more as a device than a pressure-bearing relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motive (doubt about her clairvoyance, seeking answers) is clear and carries through to the end, and her final reframing of her gift is thematically coherent. However, her interiority is largely explained rather than dramatized, with little embodied emotion or contradictory impulses on the page. The transformation from doubt to purpose feels somewhat frictionless, with no concrete cost or resistance dramatized in the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation as an archivist who refuses the elders’ dismissal is clear and consistent, and her small but real shift from isolated seeker to chosen keeper reads as earned. Interiority is concrete enough—her attention to patterns in pooled water, her tactile relationship to the valve—but rarely digs into contradictory impulses or deeper doubt. The sudden acceptance of an enormous burden is slightly under-complicated emotionally. The gray-cloaked woman functions more as a mouthpiece for exposition than as a source of genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s profession, temperament, and core tension between safety (meticulous mapping) and risk (embracing the unknown) are clearly established and feed her final choice. Interiority is present but leans on familiar abstractions (“trembling certainty”) rather than sharply individuated perception. Her hesitation before punching the ticket is motivated and credible, though the cost remains more stated than felt. The piece avoids glaring inconsistencies but doesn’t yet render her as uniquely lived-in or flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is coherent—a gentle skeptic with a quiet longing—but her interiority leans on generalized language (“a void, a longing”) rather than sharply embodied, character-specific conflict. Her shift from skepticism to acceptance happens smoothly, with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse at the peak moment. The most revealing beat is her decision to climb the abandoned tower, but even there the unease is narrated rather than dramatized through concrete behavior. The final change feels credible but lightly earned and largely cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elyr’s core motivation (boredom evolved into dangerous curiosity) is clear and consistent, and his choice to press on despite knowing the amulet is cursed feels motivated. However, his interiority leans on abstractions like “endless, aching void” rather than concrete, character-specific embodiment. There’s little genuine contradiction beyond “I know it’s dangerous but I want it,” so his final “spark of purpose” reads more told than earned through layered conflict. The emotional beats skim the surface instead of exposing a distinctive psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s honesty vs her father’s con artistry is clear, and her internal conflict around “a fresh start” vs truth is well-motivated, especially in her refusal to give the ink pot back. However, the emotional evolution at the end feels somewhat rapid and neat, turning a lifetime of conditioning with her father into a tidy insight in a few lines. The father’s softening reads plausible but underdeveloped; we get one strong beat of complexity, then a quick shift to tentative alliance. Still, her final stance against running is credibly seeded by her earlier thoughts and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her meticulous practice feels grounded in specific habits (notepad, quill, ritual listening). However, she faces almost no real opposition or internal contradiction on the page, so we don’t see her values tested or any visible cost beyond mild exhaustion. The “specialness” of this night registers, but her emotional movement is subtle rather than transformative. Strong characterization for a vignette, but not yet at elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    The wanderer’s motivation is clear and consistent—seeking the “texture of memories” as a death-certificate error survivor—but their inner life stays largely conceptual rather than embodied. We get little in the way of concrete, contradictory impulses or specific emotional friction beyond generalized yearning. The strongest moment is the reaction to the letter to Elara, where their namelessness “echoes” the boy’s desperation, but even that is told more than viscerally felt. The closing shift into “guardian of the forgotten” reads earned enough, though the cost of that stance is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation and vocation are clear and coherent, and her shift from debunker to seeker tracks cleanly. Her emotional life is rendered in concrete gestures (touching the shell, playing the cello) rather than labels. However, internal conflict is smoothed over: the “myth buster” skepticism never truly pushes back against the grandfather’s mysticism on the page. The final acceptance comes with minimal dramatized struggle or visible cost beyond a gentle reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s core motive—to protect Luminara’s culture from erasure—is clear and consistently tied to her “culture shock absorber” role and decoding of the graffiti. However, her interiority is relatively smooth and virtuous, with little contradiction or moral friction under pressure. Vorin is sketched as a flat antagonist, more symbol than person, which blunts relational pressure. The final stance (placing the chip, rallying the city) feels earned but emotionally low-cost and very tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivations (duty to the Initiative, loyalty to her mentor, reverence for history) are clear and consistent, and her grief is woven in without melodrama. However, her interiority leans on somewhat familiar phrases and doesn’t quite reach the level of idiosyncratic, contradictory impulse you’d expect at elite level. The tension between obeying mission control and honoring the hidden message is present but underdeveloped into a true tearing conflict. Her final endurance—staying through dawn—feels earned, but the emotional cost could be more sharply particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is clearly motivated, competent, and particularized by her blindness, tactile focus, and ethic of care, but she experiences almost no internal conflict or meaningful doubt. Her motivation “to restore not just the drone but the trust of its owner” is stated rather than tested, and nothing on the page forces a difficult trade-off or reveals a sharper flaw. The traveler exists mostly as a prompt and a thank-you, so relational pressure never really forms. The final sense of her as an “anchor” feels credible but lightly earned, more affirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s professional identity and lifelong obsession with river sources are clear and consistent, and her actions (following the mist, kneeling at the fissure, annotating the phrasebook) align with that drive. However, her "dry-witted" characterization never materializes on the page, and internal conflict is muted—she moves from doubt to fulfillment with little dramatized ambivalence. The closing peace feels earned but low-cost. Overall she reads distinct and credible, but not deeply conflicted or fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias’s goal and primary trait (patient, ritualistic restorer) are clear, but he reads more as a symbolic figure than a psychologically specific person. Interiority is thin and largely summarized (“His mission was clear”), with no contradictory impulses or visible emotional cost to his effort. His choices never feel pressured or difficult, so endurance is asserted rather than tested. As a result, the ending’s “guardian” stance lands conceptually but not as a hard-earned character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s motives (survival shifting to wonder and discovery) are clear and consistent, but her interiority is generalized and leans on abstractions rather than particular, embodied reactions. The fear of suffocation and entrapment never really degrades her thinking or produces contradictory impulses on the page. Her transformation from panic to peace happens quickly and is told more than dramatized, so the “cost” of that shift feels light. Overall, she functions as a viewpoint more than as a fully idiosyncratic person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motive (redeem the family legacy, escape the hush) is clear and consistent, and the final choice to reject silence grows plausibly from what he learns. However, his internal conflict is mostly articulated in abstract terms (“chased hush,” “wanted to be heard”) rather than embodied in concrete, pressured moments. The emotional cost of defying his inheritance is asserted more than dramatized. Still, he reads as a specific, non-generic character with a coherent inner drive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost bride’s core motive (repaying a debt across lifetimes) and her ambivalence about freedom are clear and consistent, with a credible inner conflict between longing for release and loyalty to a broken promise. Moments like clutching the bead while “grappl[ing] with conflicting emotions” show simultaneous impulses rather than tidy stages. However, her psychology and history with the groom remain mostly abstract, and some feelings are labeled rather than embodied, which limits depth. The final stance—a glimmer of hope tempered by reckoning—feels earned but not yet maximally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s central motivation—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is clear and consistent, and her dedication carries through to the end. However, she lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; she reads as a serene, faultless artisan rather than a pressured human. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and there is no sharp micro-choice where conflicting impulses collide. The final endurance feels conceptually earned but not deeply dramatized on a character level.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation as a diaspora returnee seeking to restore faith is clear and consistent, and her gentle, listening approach to the land tracks with that desire. However, internal contradiction is minimal: her doubts are told rather than dramatized, and she faces no real temptation to quit or betray her aim. The final “sense of belonging” comes quickly once the tomb is opened, without messy or conflicted processing on the page. The arc feels emotionally plausible but too tidy and low-cost for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s motivation (decoding marginal messages, valuing surface mail) is clear and consistent, and her competence feels grounded. However, her interiority leans generic—she rarely experiences genuine doubt, contradictory impulses, or a visible cost beyond mild time pressure. The “carefully inventive” label is told more than dramatized, and her emotional arc from curiosity to “futuristic nostalgia” is smooth rather than conflicted. At elite level, we’d want at least one choice that visibly hurts or complicates her.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is sketched with clear vocation, habits, and a believable mix of skepticism and longing, and her fear at the knock plus readiness with the dagger gives her some edge. Her swift pivot from doubt to resolve once Lira speaks, however, underplays internal conflict and the cost of belief. Lira functions more as an exposition channel than a fully realized counter-presence. The ending “purpose” lands, but the emotional price or contradiction behind it is only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and consistent, and her final choice to open and read the letter feels earned by the established regret and purpose. However, her psychology is more archetypal than particular; we get little of her idiosyncratic thinking or concrete past beyond “someone she had left behind.” Contradictory impulses are underplayed—she moves fairly smoothly from quest to catharsis without much in-scene hesitation or self-sabotage. The cost is felt but somewhat generalized rather than deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, gentleness, and stubborn hope are clearly established and stay consistent, and her motivation to decode the cast and protect the child’s memory feels grounded. The “shrewdly innocent” contradiction is interesting but under-exploited in on-page choices. Her internal conflict (innocence as liability vs. refusal to harden) is present but stays relatively smooth, without a sharp, costly misstep. The final stance shift to being “the ocean’s voice” is earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s central drive (burnt-out artist seeking lost joy) is clear and consistent, and the film encounter reawakening her purpose is credibly motivated. The interiority stays somewhat general—her despair and renewal are told in broad strokes rather than through sharply particularized contradictions or embodied reactions. Her decisive change at the end (choosing to paint again) is earned but emotionally “clean,” with little sense of lingering cost or ambivalence. Adding one moment where she doubts or resists this new calling would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara has a clear, consistent motivation (restore the mural, then answer the garden’s call), and the hesitation before “exchanging certainty for curiosity” gives her at least one credible internal conflict beat. However, her interiority stays fairly generic—her emotions are summarized (“heart raced,” “mind a whirlwind”) rather than rendered in character-specific texture. The decisive choice feels lightly sketched rather than deeply earned through accumulated contradictions. Secondary figures (the obsidian-eyed woman, the coin figure) function more as archetypal guides than as characters applying personal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly sketched as a charming, competent rogue with a specific history (linguistics lecturer turned clandestine operative), and his motives for protecting the Lexicon are coherent. His embodied reactions—the quickened heart at the seed, the instinctive reach for the dagger—give him some texture under pressure. However, internal contradiction and moral ambiguity are light: he rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses, so his final commitment costs him little on the page. Dr. Krane functions more as an expositional ally than a crucible, limiting relational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s motivation and interior landscape are clear and consistent, and the piece sustains a coherent sense of who she is as an artist. However, her inner life is stated in fairly abstract terms—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—rather than dramatized through specific, pressured micro-choices. The “shyly unstoppable” contradiction is more labeled than embodied; we rarely see shyness and drive collide on the page. The final shift toward peace is plausible but feels more asserted than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s role and core motivation are clear and consistent, and her embodied responses (the trembling hands, the overwhelm when channeling the Vessel) register. However, she moves through the story with little genuine ambivalence or contradictory impulse; her key actions (following the call, taking the Vessel, singing) feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The “foxglove regret” is intriguing but underexplored as a conflicted state. As a result, the final endurance feels more dutiful than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive and flaw (“carefully reckless”) are clearly established and tied to a concrete past mistake, and her internal promises show a credible arc toward greater humility. Her fear-based silence is psychologically plausible but explained a bit neatly, softening ambiguity. Embodied emotion is present in gestures and hesitation, though much of her struggle remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. Kael functions mainly as a receptacle for her growth, appearing late with limited nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s characterization as a precise, analytical machinist with an ethical bent is clear, and his interiority (“resolve dappled with doubt and hope”) mostly feels specific rather than generic. Motivation—balancing villagers’ fear and scholars’ curiosity—is explicit and consistent, and his observational, methodical choices track with that. However, his inner conflict is a bit too clean: he “trembles” but encounters little true resistance, and the final resolve comes without a strongly felt personal cost. The claim that he must “risk everything” is never substantiated with concrete jeopardy or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving lost songs) is clear and consistent, and her rituals with pigeons, dust, and meteorite reveal a particular psychology. However, her internal conflict largely stays at the level of summary (half-truths, reinvention) rather than dramatized contradictory impulses in specific pressured moments. The shift from reinvention to “truth” at the end feels somewhat tidy, with limited visible cost beyond implication. Strong interiority, but not yet at the depth and complexity demanded for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand sacred thresholds and her father’s absence—is clear, consistent, and carries through to the final choice to leave the logbook behind. Her interiority is specific (codes as “necessary distances”) and mostly embodied, though the emotional conflict remains relatively straightforward and tidy. The arc from obsessive seeking to accepting a painful distance is credible, if somewhat smooth. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses under pressure in the present scene, rather than mainly in retrospect.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—her search for a “rhythm of belonging” and her responsiveness to light patterns feel character-rooted rather than generic. The burnt feather and her profession both hint at prior wounds and obsessions, giving her some dimensionality in a short span. However, her internal conflict is largely summarized via realization rather than dramatized through messy, contradictory impulses under pressure. The final shift in understanding feels a touch too smooth and declarative for someone in imminent physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s vocation, personal wound (grandmother’s laughter), and present goal are clearly motivated and consistent, and her actions with the glass and seeds track well with those motives. Interiority is particular enough to feel like a distinct person, not a type. However, her emotional progression from frustration to peace is a little tidy and under-contested, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The final acceptance reads more as a gentle slide than a hard-earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias has a clear worldview and motivation, and his analytic/whimsical duality is distinct, but it’s mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. His internal conflict with “monotony” remains abstract: we’re told he “had once been a man bound by monotony,” but we never see a concrete temptation to slip back or a cost to resisting it. Emotions stay at a calm, essayistic register even at the climax. The closing stance (“he was its antidote”) feels asserted rather than earned through hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation (defying the nostalgia ban by inscribing memory into her own skin) is clear, particular, and consistent, and her choice to stand rather than flee feels psychologically earned. Interiority is well embodied through sensory focus on gaps, petals, and dust, not abstract labels. The internal conflict between fear of erasure and need to “fledge” is present but could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine doubt or temptation to comply. The sentinel is thinly drawn but functions effectively as an external pressure rather than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias is specific—a harbor glazier with a ritualized relationship to light, patterns, and reflection—and his core motivation (“illuminate what truly matters”) is clear and consistent. However, internal conflict is minimal; he rarely grapples with competing impulses or real doubt. The final decision to “share his reckonings” feels largely unpressured and low-cost, which softens the impact of his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has a coherent interior life—haunted, competent, drawn to broken things—and his motives (survivor’s guilt and a need to redeem himself) are clear and consistent. The connection between his scars, the box’s cracks, and his need to “balance the guilt” gives him specificity beyond a stock brooder. However, his emotional shifts are smooth and somewhat tidy, with little on-page contradiction or genuine resistance as he moves toward acceptance. The final acceptance feels earned enough for this length but could use one sharper moment of self-deception or relapse to deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (“logical dreamer” seeking “equations for hope”) are clear and consistently expressed through her actions and ritual. However, her interiority skews generalized and conceptual rather than idiosyncratically embodied, which softens the sense of a singular, flawed individual under pressure. Internal conflict is muted: she adapts to the tide without real hesitation or contradictory impulses, so the final realization costs her little on the page. The arc from seeking to realizing reads coherent but emotionally low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s vocation and legacy-burden give her a clear, specific motivation, and her cautious yet driven behavior tracks cleanly with that. However, internal contradiction is underplayed: she rarely seems genuinely tempted to abandon the mission or frightened by the warnings (“To listen is to lose oneself”) in a way that alters her choices. Her emotional reactions skew summarized rather than deeply embodied, so the final acceptance of “purpose” feels slightly tidy, with limited felt cost. Still, the throughline from obsession to chosen responsibility is coherent and credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and sacrifice are clear and consistent, and her calm focus under pressure tracks well with her choices, especially when she sings louder despite the toll. However, her interiority is mostly archetypal and told from a distance; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a textured inner struggle on the page. Emotional embodiment leans on generalized phrasing (“her heartbeat steady”) rather than specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final cost lands, but her inner conflict around paying it remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and internal tension—ideals eroded by long exposure to war, yet a need to “anchor her ideals in practice”—are clear and consistent, with the clipboard nicely tied to her identity. However, her emotions are often told in abstract terms rather than embodied in specific, character-particular perceptions or contradictions in-scene. The leaders remain faceless archetypes, offering no relational crucible or differentiated pressure. Her climactic speech tracks with prior setup but reads more as authorial thesis than a messy, personal breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s core contradiction—amoral profiteer vs. secret sentimentalist seeking ecological redemption—is clear and character-specific. However, much of this is told in exposition (“secretly sentimental,” “redemption she didn’t deserve”) rather than dramatized through in-scene micro-choices or destabilizing impulses. Her journey to the damp patch proceeds with near-perfect composure, so we rarely see her flaws or blind spots actively complicate decisions. The final act feels motivated but emotionally smoothed, with limited felt cost beyond generalized guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she intends to awaken the city from complacency—and her actions cleanly flow from that. However, her interiority leans toward noble abstraction (“weight of her task,” “cost of defiance”) rather than sharply particular, contradictory impulses, so she risks feeling emblematic more than fully individual. The “chaste courtesan” paradox is intriguing but under-explored in terms of lived conflict on the page. Her final stance—accepting that her role will be altered—is credible but not experienced as a painful, specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivations and inner life are clear and coherent, and his artistic ethics provide a credible engine for reflection and choice. However, he is almost entirely unopposed on the page—his turmoil is reported rather than dramatized, and his serenity-plus-insight balance keeps him from feeling deeply flawed or internally contradictory. The argument that sparked all this is offstage, so we never see him under interpersonal pressure. His final shift in purpose is believable but emotionally tidy, with limited sense of cost or lingering doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and coherent, and her actions (building the spiral, adding the wings, humming) align well with her esoteric realist stance. However, she faces almost no concrete opposition or dilemma on the page, so we see limited contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict under pressure. Her emotional life is more inferred through setting and symbolism than dramatized in embodied, choice-driven beats. The closing sense of “for now” endurance is gentle rather than a charged, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her technical tenderness toward objects gives her some texture. However, internal conflict is mostly summarized (“after forgiving yourself”) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page, so her change reads more like a stated premise than a struggle. Under pressure she remains serenely competent; there’s little sense of risk, doubt, or cost in her choices. The final recognition of her own name is moving but comes without enough prior resistance or moral tangle to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Foresight’s central motivation is clear and sustained, but they face little real friction or contradictory impulse on the page, so their inner life feels more emblematic than individuated. Emotion is largely summarized (“haunted them for years”) rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final realization arrives smoothly, without much depicted struggle or cost. As a result, the character reads as a strong concept more than a fully realized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s core motivation (curiosity and desire to seal a covenant) is clear and consistent, but largely told rather than embodied in specific, pressured choices. His “frugal” and “empirically ironic” traits mostly stay at the level of labels, with few concrete behaviors that dramatize them. The shift from skeptic to devotee is asserted, not really fought for on the page, so the internal conflict remains thin. As a result, the final acceptance of his role reads more like a premise being fulfilled than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara and Kael are clearly motivated and distinct, and her commitment to nonviolent persuasion tracks through her choices, but their inner lives lean on generalized, therapeutic language (“resentment is heavy”) rather than character-specific texture. The “scheming pacifist” angle is asserted more than dramatized; her manipulation never feels morally fraught on the page. Kael’s shift from hard resentment to “How do I start?” lands but feels somewhat quick and low-cost for the depth of hurt implied.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (capturing the runaway dream) is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a mirror maker shapes how she approaches the sextant. Interiority is present but relatively restrained; we get desire and curiosity more than a layered conflict between groundedness and longing. Her final stance—rooted in the present yet willing to cross the “bridge”—is earned but low-cost, with limited visible internal struggle on the page. The wanderer functions more as a catalyst than as a source of relational pressure, so character dynamics stay fairly simple.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and consistent, particularly her mix of regret and determination centered on Lyra and the broken vow. Her micro-choices with the bag objects and the ribbon feel character-driven, not arbitrary. However, the internal conflict remains fairly straightforward—her shift from doubt to acceptance comes smoothly, with limited dramatized resistance. The final emotional resolution edges toward tidy rather than deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to pursue forbidden knowledge—is clear and consistent, and we get a decent sense of her worldview through her reflections on inheritance and mystery. However, her interiority rarely shows genuine contradiction or fraught trade-offs; she moves from bewilderment to “surge of purpose” with little felt resistance. The emotional states are more labeled than embodied, and her breakthrough feels somewhat granted rather than wrestled for. The relationship with the “keeper of stories” is sketched, not really tested or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara has a clear skill set and goal, and her “carefully resourceful” nature is shown through research and trap navigation, but we rarely see genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her emotional life is summarized more than embodied, and Kael remains a thin sketch whose urgency never complicates her choices in a meaningful way. The final bargain with the guardian feels competent but too smooth, with little sense of personal cost or risk. Overall, character is functional and coherent but not yet distinctive or deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (find the garden / recapture what was lost, tied to Lyra) is clear and consistent, and her curiosity for the anomalous feels character-specific. Interiority is present but often couched in generalized language (“mixture of curiosity and sorrow,” “felt incomplete”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her final realization about embracing her “blissfully aberrant” self is thematically apt but arrives somewhat tidily, with limited on-page struggle in the decisive moment. The relationship with Lyra is emotionally potent but mostly summarized instead of dramatized, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s professional motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her actions (studying the seal, decoding the rope, stepping through the door) align with that. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and there is little internal contradiction or emotional struggle under pressure. Her adaptability is asserted more than tested, which flattens potential complexity. The closing realization feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira’s external motivation—to protect harmony by finding the bloom of hush—is clear and consistent, and her competence with the ice cracks and stone tracks with that goal. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she’s steady, resolved, and emotionally undercomplicated. Embodiment stays abstract (“her heart steady despite the weight of her task,” “her body weary but her spirit light”) rather than specific or character-particular. The final endurance choice (becoming guardian) is thematically apt but carries little felt cost beyond mild fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s central motivation and dedication are clear and consistent, and her sacrificial choice aligns with them, but her internal conflict is under-drawn: the hesitation over losing memories is brief and smoothed over. Emotions are often summarized (“her hands trembling with thistle-blown hope”) rather than grounded in more specific, character-particular embodiment. We don’t see much contradiction or messiness in her psychology, which makes the final sacrifice feel a bit too clean. The result is a solid but not deeply textured characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role, longing, and meticulousness are clearly established and her actions align well with her archivist motivation. However, her interiority stays relatively smooth: we don’t see strong contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure, only a quiet fulfillment of duty. The “preemptively nostalgic” trait is mostly told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The closing recommitment feels emotionally apt but low-cost, more a continuation than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to defy the fortress’s hopelessness—and her actions align cleanly with that goal. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance, internal or external, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her interiority is fairly generalized (“her heart ached, but her resolve deepened”) rather than idiosyncratic. The final “cost” is mostly stated (the battle is far from over) rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and consistent, and her response to Kael’s criticism gives her some texture, but her internal conflict is underdeveloped—she never feels genuinely torn between doubt and conviction. The shift from “to discover” to “to become part of” time’s texture is thematically apt but lands as a smooth affirmation rather than a hard-won, costly turn. Embodied emotion is light; we see her “warmly observant” nature more than any fraught, contradictory feeling. Kael as a relational crucible is mostly hypothetical, since he never appears on the page to apply live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing for open sky, her claustrophobia, and attachment to the doll are clear and specific, and her preparation for the inversion shows coherent, motivated action. However, internal contradiction is relatively soft—her feelings toward her father’s obsession and her own guilt or ambivalence remain underdeveloped, so the final internal shift feels somewhat straightforward. The emotional cost of changing after tasting “true silence” is more told than textured in embodied behavior. Overall she reads distinct and motivated, but not yet deeply conflicted or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias and Mira are clearly motivated and distinct, and his quiet vocation plus the vial give him some specificity. However, both remain relatively unconflicted internally; Mira’s anxiety dissolves a bit too smoothly, and we don’t see much contradiction or cost in either character. The relationship dynamic is gentle and coherent but never really pressured. The final shift for Mira feels earned but low-stakes and almost therapeutic rather than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and her competence as a lore keeper is credibly shown through reading murals and solving the mechanism. However, her interiority stays fairly generic—there’s little contradiction between fear and desire, and almost no moment where her values are truly tested. The “wisely adventurous” trait is told more than dramatized via painful tradeoffs. Her final understanding feels plausible but arrives without much emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s duty, scars, and ethos as a careful bridge-burner form a coherent, motivated core, and her choice to sacrifice a scar for the sanctuary is credibly earned. However, her inner conflict is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page; we’re told the cost “weighed heavily” more than we feel it through behavior. Emotional states lean on generalized phrasing (“hollow ache,” “loaded emptiness”) rather than highly particular, embodied reactions. The result is strong but not yet cuttingly specific characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara has a clear backstory and trait set (pyramid scheme survivor, “virtuously mischievous”), and her curiosity about the bolt and willingness to step through the portal follow plausibly from those. However, her interiority remains fairly generic—she’s “intrigued and slightly unnerved,” then hopeful—without much contradiction or textured emotional embodiment. Her past trauma with schemes never meaningfully complicates her decision to trust the glitchy texts, so her key choices lack felt cost. The final shift into “guardian” feels more assigned than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s desire to understand her family’s downfall is clear and consistent, and the gramophone/journal interactions align with that motivation. However, she remains more archetypal than sharply individualized, with relatively generic interiority (“her mind racing,” “the truth was painful”). Internal conflict is underdeveloped: there’s little sense of competing impulses or real reluctance, and the acceptance of her role as “dynasty ender” lands as tidy rather than costly. The closing shift to “keeper of a hidden truth” feels earned enough, but not deeply fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric’s interiority is specific (his fixation on the program, the armor as burden, the puppet imagery) and his withdrawal is dramatized rather than just told. His motivation—to reengage with possibility—is legible and his final self-redefinition as storyteller feels causally prepared. However, his shift happens with little visible resistance or contradiction on the page; he moves fairly smoothly from detachment to “shivering bliss.” The cost of this transformation (what he risks or loses) remains mostly conceptual, softening the sense of a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s characterization as a former foster child turned archivist is specific and coherent, with her curiosity about the button and choice to write Liam’s story emerging naturally from her history and stated motive. Her emotions are mostly embodied through tactile interactions with the files, dust, and objects rather than pure labels. However, internal conflict is soft: her shift from pain to purpose happens smoothly, with little on-page ambivalence or felt cost. Some traits (“broken-hearted,” “tactfully hopeful”) are told rather than dramatized, though not egregiously.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, with concrete ties to the histories and the key, and her choice to broadcast rather than flee is credibly rooted in those traits. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“tyranny of indifference”) rather than specific, conflicted feelings in the moment. We rarely see genuinely contradictory impulses under pressure; she reads as almost uniformly steadfast. The result is a strong but not deeply multi-layered characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he plays to hush the prophecy—but he reads more as an archetype than an individuated person. Interiority remains generalized, with little contradiction or textured emotional life beyond haunted focus. Micro-choices (keep playing vs stop) don’t meaningfully shift his stance or reveal new facets. The final endurance feels earned but low-cost and not deeply personalized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and consistent—duty, curiosity, reverence for folklore—but she faces almost no real friction or contradictory impulses on the page. Her “transformation” into guardian of forgotten truths is largely asserted rather than tested through a difficult choice. Emotional texture is gentle and somewhat uniform, with little embodiment beyond standard “heart raced” style phrasing. The arc reads credible but low-pressure, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tinkerer has a clear core—perfectionist yet tolerant of brokenness—and his curiosity credibly drives him from workshop to cavern. His internal shift from controlling time to accepting uncertainty is motivated by the journey, though it lands a bit too cleanly and declaratively. Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, which keeps his arc from feeling fully lived-in. The lack of on-page relational pressure also limits the depth of his contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand the weight of names) is clear and consistent, and we see her make micro-choices under pressure (approaching and entering the furnace despite fear). The interiority is specific enough—regret over the search party, attraction/unease toward the coin—and the final acceptance of the coin as hers feels earned. However, her inner conflict resolves somewhat cleanly, with little sense of genuinely competing impulses at the end, softening the cost of her change. The emotional progression is credible but a bit too tidy for top-tier literary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a soul collector feels specific rather than generic. However, “modestly fearless” never quite generates on-page contradiction or cost; she meets little internal resistance and moves through the scene with near-ideal composure. The shadow-father’s confession is affecting but sketched in broad strokes, limiting complexity. Her closing sense of having “found a piece of herself” is earned but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation and history as an interrogation survivor are clear and coherent, and the strap serves as a strong personal anchor. However, her internal conflict is under-pressured; we’re mostly told her stance rather than watching her wrestle with contradictory impulses in real time. The realization about mercy arrives a bit too cleanly, with limited dramatized struggle leading up to it. Emotional states skew toward abstraction (“trauma responses,” “recalibrated to survive”) instead of more idiosyncratic, embodied moments.

    Lila’s motivation and history with the lighthouse are clear and consistent, and her occupation as a translator of forgotten stories fits her actions. However, she faces little real internal contradiction; she wants to honor histories and simply proceeds to do so without moral or emotional friction. The result is a sympathetic but somewhat flat interior life. The final “change” is more confirmation of an existing self-concept than a hard-earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is clearly drawn, with his trade, ghost-sight, and fixation on ceilings cohering into a believable, particular worldview, and his micro-choices (studying dust, climbing, installing the barrel) track cleanly with those traits. However, internal conflict is muted: his “weightless burden” is asserted more than dramatized, and he encounters little genuine resistance or self-contradiction under pressure. The shift from burdened to peaceful lands emotionally but with limited visible cost or moral friction. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly layered or piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motive (“to compress eternity into a single, perfect moment”) is clear and threads through the piece, and her curiosity and willingness to step off the platform are consistent with it. However, interiority is largely declarative rather than conflicted—she rarely feels torn, frightened, or morally pressed. The transition from worker to “caretaker” comes quickly and with minimal on-page cost or ambivalence. This keeps her from fully escaping a slightly archetypal, Chosen-One initiation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—vindicating her theory and seeking redemption—but her interiority leans on summary rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses in the climactic scene. The “defunct revolutionary” past and tarnished reputation set up compelling potential conflict, yet we rarely feel her actively torn on the page. Her emotional responses around the shard and visions are specific and embodied (“tears…not of joy but of burnished sorrow”), which grounds her. The change at the end (external vindication, internal wounds persisting) is credible and earned but could cut deeper with more in-scene micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias has a clear trait (curiosity) and vocation, and his hesitation vs. fascination around the box gives him some texture, but his inner conflict never sharpens beyond mild unease. The stranger is essentially a delivery mechanism and vanishes before any relationship pressure can develop. Elias’s final understanding (“mending what isn’t torn…”) is conceptually earned but emotionally light, with little sense of personal cost or contradiction resolved. The result is competent, slightly archetypal characterization rather than a deeply individuated psyche under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to follow her grandfather’s compass and seek “the place where explanations fail”—is coherent and sustained, and her choices (following the compass, entering the tunnel, accepting the loss of the compass) align with that motive. However, she encounters little genuine resistance or internal contradiction; her “sensibly eccentric” nature is asserted more than dramatized as a source of tension. The one real renunciation—letting the compass sink—is thematically apt but comes with minimal felt cost on the page. A bit more conflict between curiosity, fear, and grief over her grandfather would deepen her beyond the archetypal mystic explorer.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s vocation, obsession with the slide, and mantra “Reimagine” give her a distinct profile, and her motivation is consistently articulated. However, her emotional life under pressure feels smoothed out—fear and exhilaration are named but not deeply embodied—and internal contradictions never really bite. Her final shift into “keeper of timewoven alliances” is clear but low-cost and largely affirmational. The characterization is solid but lacks the messy, pressured ambiguity that would feel truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation—to capture a dreamlike cathedral and understand nocturnal beauty—is clear and consistent, and her choice to undertake the journey and then paint through the night aligns with that drive. However, her emotional life stays relatively smooth; we get intensity but little contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. The ending realization feels earned enough but carries minimal on-page cost beyond fatigue and distance traveled. Interiority is largely thematic and lyrical rather than sharply character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation as a civil-rights archivist driven to uncover buried truths is clear and consistent, and her actions—traveling to the lagoon, arranging debris, offering the diary—align with that aim. However, her interiority is fairly one-note (grief + determination) with little on-page contradiction or genuine micro-conflict under pressure. The “retrocognitively trapped” trait is asserted rather than dramatized, so it doesn’t deepen her behavior or choices. The closing shift to hope is believable but carries limited visible cost or internal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation and competence are clear, and her actions align with her stated purpose, but she faces almost no resistance and exhibits little internal contradiction under pressure. The rejection of nostalgia is asserted more than dramatized, so her values are not truly tested. Emotional experience is sketched rather than deeply embodied. The ending choice to leave feels consistent but comes without a strongly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s vocation, curiosity, and sense of reverence come through clearly, and her actions are motivated and consistent with her role as an oath scribe. However, we don’t see much internal contradiction or real ambivalence when the prophecy emerges; she moves quite smoothly from curiosity to acceptance. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied under real pressure. The ending choice to say “I remember” lands, but it doesn’t feel like it costs her anything or forces her to renounce an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (understanding “borrowed time” and using the vortex to heal the world) is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. However, “furiously tranquil” never quite materializes as a live contradiction in her choices; she moves through the scene with near-total composure and little real ambivalence. Interiority is present but leans toward archetypal, prophetic language rather than character-particular thought. The final acceptance of responsibility feels earned enough but comes without much visible internal struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and contemplative temperament are clear, and his occupation and habits feel coherent with his inner life. However, he experiences very little genuine internal conflict or contradiction—he’s almost entirely aligned with the story’s thematic stance from the start. His final “becoming keeper” feels more like an anointment by the world than a pressured choice with visible cost. The emotional palette stays relatively generalized, with few sharply individualized reactions under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is clearly sketched—competent, proud of her work, spiritually curious—and her reactions to the lantern feel consistent and grounded in that nature. Her inner shift from “maintenance worker” to “keeper of stillness” is legible and earned by the lantern experience. What’s missing at this level is real contradiction or friction in her: she accepts the lantern’s call and her new worldview with little resistance or cost. The result is a credible but somewhat too-smooth arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motivation—to understand and then restore the covenant—is clear and consistent, and his perceptiveness is well dramatized in how he reads the environment. However, he experiences almost no real resistance, doubt, or contradictory impulse; once “chosen,” he simply proceeds. The lack of visible cost or moral friction at the climax flattens his arc into acceptance rather than earned change. As a result, he feels more like a gentle archetype than a fully particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to fix the malfunctioning flow of time and understand the urn fragment—is clear and drives her actions, but her interiority remains relatively generalized and low-friction. We rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure; she moves from discovery to solution with little visible doubt or cost. Thaddeus has a clean, functional motivation yet feels lightly sketched emotionally. The final sense of “belonging” is earned enough to work, but not deeply rooted in on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (approaching the kite, offering the feather, sharing poetry) follow from that. The wanderer is somewhat thinner but still coherent, with a plausible sadness and receptivity. What’s missing is real internal conflict: she rarely wants two incompatible things at once, so the emotional arc feels linear and safe. The final change for him (“You’ve reminded me…”) is credible but minimally priced and arrives a bit easily.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation and temperament (gently systematic, brazenly calm, legacy-focused) are clear and consistent, and his actions track logically from them. However, his interior life remains largely untroubled; we don’t feel real contradiction or doubt as death approaches. The death sentence feels more like framing than an active psychological pressure on the page. His final acceptance is emotionally plausible but not hard-earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her skeptic/fascinated contradiction is well-seeded (“luminous skeptic,” “spent her career dismantling myths” yet drawn to the tower). Her interiority is mostly concrete and filtered through sensory experience, though emotions skew reflective rather than pressured. The final softening of her skepticism is earned by the journey but feels low-cost and a bit tidy. Secondary character (the pilgrim) is evocative but exerts almost no active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The coachman’s core motivation—reclaiming a battlefield with a garden—is clear and consistent, and his actions (planting, listening to birds, speaking to spirits) align with it. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told his heart is “heavy” and then sparked by “possibility,” but we don’t see contradictory impulses or real doubt. The “keeper of dead languages and weaver of concord” reads more as a role-label than as a felt, conflicted psyche. His change by the end is modest and largely asserted, so the emotional cost remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is sketched with concrete history and embodied aging, and his reluctance-turned-curiosity feels coherent, but his inner conflict is under-pressured and resolves a bit too cleanly. The shift from retirement to re-engagement with mystery is handled, yet without a sharp, character-specific cost. Lira functions more as a prompt than as an active crucible, so the relationship doesn’t significantly transform either of them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand the temporal collapse and guide others—is clear and consistent, and her “blessed pariah” status gives her a distinct frame. However, her interiority stays abstract (“true north of existence,” “fragility of existence”) rather than embodied in concrete sensations or contradictory impulses in the moment. The final resolve to see her role as a calling feels somewhat declared rather than earned through difficult micro-choices on the page. The lack of present-tense interpersonal or situational pressure keeps her change from landing as fully costly or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s core motivation (restore the sky / reclaim lost wonder) is clear and consistent, and his “chivalrous thief” identity gives him a mildly distinctive center. However, internal conflict is mostly summarized (“had long since traded his sacredly playful nature for the harsh realities of survival”) rather than dramatized in hard choices. The climax doesn’t force a visible sacrifice beyond a symbolic chess trade, so the cost of his transformation feels light. Overall he reads coherent but not deeply particularized or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clearly articulated (crisis actor, desire to “unbind,” historian of small gestures), and her shift at the end feels earned by the walk and conversation. However, her conflict remains mostly abstract and tidy—she moves from role-confusion to insight with little genuine resistance or mess. Kael has a readable presence and status but is more function than person. The final realization (“You’ve always been a historian…”) borders on too neat for the complexity implied.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s core motivation (to understand “the shape of home”) is clear and consistent, and her escape impulse versus her need to confront memory gives her some genuine contradiction. Her magic and avoidance habits feel like natural extensions of her psychology rather than labels. However, the internal struggle resolves too smoothly once the stone appears; there’s little sense of real risk that her attempt might fail or that she might turn away. The final wholeness reads more as a declared state than as the end of a visibly contested inner battle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s guilt and drive for self-forgiveness are clear and consistent, and the chess-piece habit plus her methodical decoding of the tapestry give her some specificity. However, her inner life leans on generalized language (“the weight of her guilt”) rather than sharply particular thoughts or contradictions in the peak beats. The final shift toward self-forgiveness feels somewhat tidy and under-contested, with little sense of what darker impulses she’s resisting in the moment. The exile status is barely dramatized, so a potentially rich flaw/backstory vector remains mostly label-only.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation and interiority are clear and coherent—her desire to “refract a single truth into many” and her defiance of the elders carry through every beat. Emotional experience is embodied enough (the weight on her chest, the trembling voice), though some phrasing leans on generic abstraction (“weight of her longing,” “shard of her heart”). The internal conflict between wanting release and resisting the cost is present but could be sharper and messier; her final acceptance comes a bit smoothly. Still, her arc from seeking to reshape forgiveness to recognizing it as a self-wound she must heal feels earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and we get some rooted, sensory interiority (trembling hands, smell of oil and rust), but her inner life stays fairly one-note—uncertainty transmuting into conviction without much contradictory pull. Her shift from fear to “We are all broken… but it is in our brokenness that we find strength” feels more like a clean thesis than a messy, earned reckoning. There’s little sense of her making a painful trade-off; the risk to her and to the workshop never really bites back on her psyche. Overall she reads coherent but somewhat schematic rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to fulfill an old promise and create something timeless) is clear and consistent, and her painterly lens gives her some specificity. However, her emotional life leans toward summary and label (“intimately aloof”) rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. Her turning point—deciding to paint and then to display the work—comes with little felt resistance or cost, so the change reads somewhat easy. The arc is coherent but not yet psychologically deep enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s quiet, doubt-ridden nature is clearly established and his actions (examining the cork, following the woman) align with that characterization. His internal motivation around “whispers vs shouts” is specific, if somewhat on-the-nose. The emotional shift from doubt to clarity is earned enough by the pattern of sensations and encounters, but it lands a bit too cleanly, with little visible cost or enduring contradiction. The woman functions more as an archetypal guide than a fully realized character, which slightly flattens the relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her choice to follow the calls and build the beacon coheres with her grief-inflected sense of duty. However, her interiority leans abstract (“navigate the geography of loss”) and idealized, with little on-page contradiction or messy impulse under pressure. The arrival of refugees elicits a simple swell of fulfillment rather than a more complex mix of fear, doubt, or overwhelm that would deepen her. The emotional progression from isolation to purpose is credible but a bit too smooth for top-tier literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motives (rational control, psychological safety, withdrawal after the empathy virus) are clear and consistent, and his choices—taking the eye, seeking Mara, then returning it—track well with those traits. The involuntary truth-telling creates a credible internal conflict, though it’s only lightly dramatized (one on-page outburst). His final stance about “choosing which truths to carry” feels earned but slightly tidy and thematically worded rather than fully embodied. Mara functions cleanly as a secondary character, but she applies information rather than real pressure on his values.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and textured—his habits, attachment to the Edelweiss, and attraction to “gaps” feel particular rather than generic. His motivation to pursue the stranger’s trace is credible and consistent, and the final acceptance of the borrowed memories is earned. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal contradiction under pressure; his solitude and curiosity never really clash in a way that forces a difficult choice. Emotional embodiment stays more atmospheric than bodily, keeping us slightly outside him at decisive moments.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias has a clear situation (lonely, map-obsessed) and takes concrete actions, but his interiority remains mostly summarized rather than textured, and his “empirically intuitive” nature never complicates his choices. His transformation from directionless dealer to purposeful guardian is asserted rather than felt through contradiction or sacrifice. The loneliness that opens the piece barely pressures his decisions. The final sense of purpose lands, but without visible cost or a sharp internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    The queen’s motivation (recurring dreams, disenchantment, responsibility) is clear and consistent, and her decision to go despite warnings tracks. However, her interiority leans generic—she rarely feels like a singular personality rather than “a fantasy queen with doubts.” The transition from disenchanted to purpose-driven happens quickly and without much visible inner resistance on the page. We don’t really see contradictory impulses grinding against each other in key moments like entering the grotto or confronting the starlit figure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation—to “capture the density of presence”—is clear and consistent, and Kael’s role as trusting friend is coherent. However, there is almost no internal conflict or visible cost; Elara never doubts, fails, or risks the friendship in any meaningful way. Emotional states tend to be stated rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways (“his heart full”). The ending change in their relationship reads more as affirmed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent: she’s a lucid dream chronicler driven to “distill chaos into narrative,” and her jealousy of past selves is a concrete, character-particular flaw. The emotional progression from envy and confusion to gratitude reads earned, with the grave and the scroll both feeding that arc. Internal conflict—envy vs. present self-worth—is present, though it sometimes gets summarized rather than fully dramatized in on-page micro-choices. The resolution skews a bit tidy, with the new stance arriving cleanly and with limited mess or lingering contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clear, specific, and internally consistent; her anosmia, precision, and “trembling calm” coherently drive how she handles both clocks and Mira. Her emotional life is mostly shown through embodied attention to objects rather than labels, which works well. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (grief vs. compensatory gifts) resolves a bit tidily, with little on-page resistance at the end. Mira functions credibly but mainly as a catalyst, not a fully pressured relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desire “to transform scars into stories” is clear and consistently dramatized through her physical scars, the quill, and the ceremony. The internal contradiction between rational scholar and superstitious child is strong, especially when she deliberately revisits old beliefs as a coping tool. Emotions are mostly embodied (trembling fingers, crystallizing quill), though some phrasing drifts toward summary and neat self-understanding. The final shift toward peace feels earned but a bit too tidy, with limited sense of lingering flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in the bottle, the archive, and the orchard, and her need to apologize feels credible and consistent. The moment where the apology becomes a “current” rather than words is a strong, character-rooted choice. However, her inner conflict is relatively smooth—there’s little live contradiction or resistance once she commits to the ritual. The change at the end (lightness, reconnection) is earned but somewhat tidy for this emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    The witness has a clear, consistent motivation and role, but reads more as an archetypal function than a fully embodied person. Interiority is largely abstract (“knew this book was…a key”) rather than sensory or emotionally specific, and we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from “end of history witness” to “beginning of a new unity” is conceptually strong but not earned through concrete struggle. As a result, the change feels more declared than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and quasi-mystical drive to understand “what clocks really measured” are clear and consistent, and his small on-page choices (staying after the whistle, examining the key, turning it in the hidden slot) all align with that motive. However, his interiority leans general and tidy—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine risk to destabilize him, so the final peace feels somewhat cheaply won. Embodied emotion is light; we get heart pounding but not much idiosyncratic, character-specific texture. The change at the end is believable but low-cost, more declared than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara has a clear professional frame, a formative relationship with her father, and a legible internal shift, but her emotional life stays generalized and largely unconflicted. We get labels like “spatially gifted mind” and “physics of letting go” without much dramatized struggle or contradiction on the page. Her decision to trust the intruder feels relatively easy, with little sense of a real cost beyond vague unease. The shadowy figure functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized character exerting pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and coherent, with a clear blend of rebellion and pragmatism shaped by her father’s history. Her emotional state is mostly embodied through tactile interaction with the lantern and the library space. However, the final realization (“In the end, Elara realized…”) tips toward a neat epiphany that flattens some of her earlier contradictions. The father–daughter dynamic, while vivid, remains largely conceptual since he never appears on the page to actively pressure her.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eli’s loneliness, professional detachment, and wary fascination with the disc are clear and consistent, and his final phone call reads as a credible shift from “cultivated estrangement” to tentative connection. His motivations—to maintain distance, then to use the disc, then to reach out—are legible and causally linked. However, his inner life is more told than dramatized, with limited on-page contradictory impulses under pressure. The transformation works, but it feels a touch smoothed-over rather than wrestled-for.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s vocation and desire to “preserve the weight of small moments” are clear and consistent, and her care with the locket feels particular to her. However, she experiences almost no true internal conflict or contradiction; her curiosity and purpose are never tested. Mara is more a benevolent exposition source than an active pressure on Elara. The final “choice” to document the story is aligned with her initial setup and thus carries limited sense of change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (a “cure for loneliness”) is clear and carried through, and the connection between her work in disaster relief and her loneliness gives her specificity. Interiority is present and mostly concrete, but some feelings are summarized in broad abstractions (“depth of longing,” “fragility of human connection”). Her decisive change—reframing loneliness as something cured through created connection—is motivated by the station experience, though the cost of this shift is lightly sketched rather than deeply felt. The “desperately jocular” trait is told rather than dramatized, weakening contradiction and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s core traits and motivation are clear and appealing, and her sensory world (vibration, language through skin) individualizes her. However, she experiences little genuine resistance—internal or external—so we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The realization that the depths she seeks are within is thematically apt but arrives without much dramatized struggle, which softens its impact. Actions align with motives, but the arc feels more gently fulfilled than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s vocation, paradox (“confidently uncertain”), and relationship to the pen give her a distinct outline, and her choice to step into the void and write is consistent and motivated. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: there’s little dramatized hesitation, fear, or competing impulse at the key moments. Emotional states tend to be told in summary (“she felt a strange comfort”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final acceptance of peace lands but feels somewhat costless because her flaws and blind spots are not meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation and loneliness are clear and consistent, and the choice to keep “mapping” and then “shaping” silence gives her a modest but legible internal arc. However, her interiority leans on generalized reflection (“the words she’d whispered… none of it had mattered”) rather than concrete, character-particular memories or contradictions. We don’t see meaningful internal conflict beyond sadness vs. determination, so the final stance feels gently affirmed rather than hard-won. The cost of her choice—to remain unseen, remembered only by herself—stays more stated than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—the arsonist’s drive to “rescue a forgotten promise” coherently shapes every action—but interiority stays generalized, with little contradiction or genuine moral mess. We’re told about “volcanic tenderness” more than we feel it in specific, embodied reactions or difficult micro-choices. The “arsonist” label hints at a darker flaw but is never dramatized beyond a soft contrast (“not to burn but to uncover”). The ending shift to closure is emotionally legible yet feels low-cost and somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is clear and largely consistent—her anxiety, grounding habit, and desire to reclaim agency all track—but she rarely displays genuinely conflicting impulses in-scene. The shift from feeling haunted by entangled memories to fully embracing them as a “gift” is a bit swift and tidy for the depth of trauma implied. Her rebellion is mostly asserted rather than tested under real pressure, as the scientists and their control stay off-page. The final identity turn (“no longer just a guinea pig—she was a weaver of dreams”) is thematically apt but edges into slogan rather than a costly, dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    Eli has a clear role, a distinctive sensory talent, and a credible, if somewhat thin, desire to “prove” the quiet approach matters; Mira provides a nice counter-pressure with her confident, challenging energy. However, Eli’s interior conflict is underdeveloped—there’s little felt struggle between fear, curiosity, and loneliness in the key decision beats. The final realization about whispers lands more as a tidy thesis than an earned, messy change in self-understanding. Emotional embodiment tends toward abstractions (“weight of the moment”) rather than specific, character-particular reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    The guardian is an evocative archetype but remains largely opaque internally; their “motivation” is stated as a metaphor rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The stranger’s shift from burdened to lighter is clear but emotionally generalized (“flicker of hope,” “unburdened”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular detail. Relationship dynamics (silent guide/confessor) work, yet there’s little sense of what it costs either of them. The endurance/renunciation at the end feels more like a pose than a pressured, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but he feels more like an emblem of “contemplation” than a fully conflicted person. His gift and ideals are described rather than stress-tested; there’s no moment where he must choose between competing values. Emotional states are largely summarized in elevated language, with little embodied specificity. The ending offers satisfaction but no visible personal cost or contradiction resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s competence and guardedness are vividly established, and her micro-choices (picking up the scrimshaw, deciding to follow the call, letting it go) are consistent with a quietly driven character. The internal conflict—fearful self-protection versus the urge toward self-knowledge—is present but not deeply dramatized in-scene; she moves through key turns with limited visible resistance. The final shift toward “combative tenderness” feels earned by prior setup but could carry more on-page cost or messiness to reach top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly motivated by grief and survival under the mandate, with consistent actions (seclusion, whittling, private narration) aligned to those drives. Her history as an actor and her brother’s fate give her interiority some specificity beyond generic dystopian anguish. However, her conflict is largely stated rather than dramatized in hard choices, and contradictory impulses (compliance vs rebellion) stay more conceptual than behaviorally messy. The final resolve feels credible but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The poet’s motivation (to transcend boundaries through art) is clear and consistent, and their choices—to enter, to speak, to surrender—track with that. However, the character remains largely archetypal; “cloud-shadow poet” is evocative but never individuated beyond role and disposition. Internal conflict is minimal; they experience awe and surrender, but no real push-pull or contradictory impulse under pressure. The final “change” feels more like a smooth apotheosis than a costly, character-specific turn.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motives and worldview (colorblindness, trading in “awakenings,” seeking essence over color) are clear and coherent, and his actions with the concertina and plants arise naturally from them. However, his internal conflict is gentle and largely unopposed; contradictory impulses (shame vs. pride, doubt vs. faith in his methods) are only lightly implied. The final acceptance of “beauty in imperfection” reads earned but somewhat tidy and low-cost. Secondary characters function more as affirming presences than as crucibles that apply pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s goal and general temperament are clear and consistent, and her fascination with sound gives her some specificity. However, her interiority leans abstract and declarative (“to discover the texture of connection”) rather than embodied or sharply individualized. The piece gestures at growth (renewed purpose) but the change involves little visible cost or internal contradiction on the page. As a result, she reads more as a thematic vehicle than a fully pressured, particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is cleanly drawn as a grieving craftswoman whose routines, attachment to her husband’s work, and reluctance about the tattoo all feel consistent and grounded. Her micro-choices—the observatory as refuge, tracing the stencil, finally pressing it to her arm—are motivated and reveal a believable hierarchy of values. The internal conflict (clinging to the past vs. moving forward) is present but could be sharpened with more live contradiction in the peak moment. The final renewal of purpose feels earned, if somewhat gently won.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity and methodical mindset are clearly established and drive her choices, and Mira’s desperation and determination come through enough to feel real. However, internal contradiction is minimal—Elara never meaningfully wavers between competing impulses, so her arc reads as steady competence more than pressured change. The “saved and haunted” line hints at richer conflict that never quite appears in scene. The relationship dynamic is functional but not deeply tested; there’s little visible cost to their collaboration beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner conflict—devotion to forbidden knowledge versus erosion of innocence—are clear and consistent, with “anguished and joyful” aptly capturing her contradiction. Her micro-choices (trusting the archive’s unpredictability, focusing on absence, speaking the purify/remember word) track logically from those traits. However, the emotional shift at the end tilts toward neat insight rather than a fully messy, costly reckoning. The interiority is strong but sometimes told in abstractions instead of more character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to uncover the forgotten and then to preserve hope once she recognizes the shadow’s nature—is clear and consistent, and her archivist mindset feels particular rather than generic. The river stone as talisman grounds her emotionally and reveals attachment to the world below. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild; she moves from curiosity to insight to decision with little real resistance or contradiction on the page. The “luminous regret” is evocative but somewhat label-like, sketched more in summary than in fully dramatized, messy feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is clear and consistent, but leans on generalized abstractions (“layers of naivety, layers of fear, layers of doubt”) rather than sharply embodied, character-specific contradiction. Her key choices—reframing the tail tip, rearranging tools, shelving the talisman—are motivated but low-friction, with little sense of competing impulses in the moment. The gentleness and shaken conviction register, yet she risks reading as an archetype of “wounded caretaker” more than a singular person. The final stance feels earned enough for this length, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s core drive (closure-seeking, haunted by partial memories) is clear and consistent, and her plant-telepathy plus fascination with scars gives her some individuality. However, her internal conflict is relatively soft: once the plants say “Tunnel,” she follows with little hesitation or competing impulse, so choices never feel truly pressured. The final sense of healing arrives quickly and smoothly, without much dramatized struggle or cost. Characterization is solid but not yet deep or contradiction-rich enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking where unused love is stored—is clear and character-specific, and her psychometry practice gives her interiority a concrete anchor. We get some embodied emotion (trembling hands, weight of letters) and a credible shift from curiosity to purpose at the end. However, her internal conflict is muted: contradictory impulses (responsibility vs. fear, skepticism vs. belief) are only lightly sketched, so her final choice carries limited felt cost. A bit more irrationality or resistance in her reactions would deepen her as an individual rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s longing and cosmically attuned sensibility are clear and specific, and her family heirloom and childhood memory give her some depth. However, she faces almost no concrete on-page pressure, so we rarely see her make hard, revealing micro-choices. The “shadowed rapture” is more described than dramatized in contradictory impulses. As a result, she reads as an effective mood figure more than a fully tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara has a clear, coherent goal (reach the archive and rekindle the sparks) and her actions align with it, but her interiority remains relatively generic and unconflicted. The label “dreamless freight guard” hints at deeper contradiction that never meaningfully appears in scene. She encounters no serious resistance or moral tension, so her final stance (“protect their divergence”) feels earned in plot terms but emotionally low-cost. The result is a functional but not yet distinctive or pressured characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eamon’s curiosity and philosophical restlessness are clear and consistent, and his choice to follow the wind and activate the machine aligns with that motivation. However, his interior life leans on labels (“void,” “curiosity,” “insight”) more than concrete, character-specific embodiment. Internal conflict is thin—he’s puzzled and yearning, but rarely pulled between competing impulses in scene. The final realization feels somewhat unearned emotionally because we haven’t seen him truly risk or foreclose anything to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation (the broken “leash,” search for unused courage) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is reasonably embodied (“mist clinging to her skin like a second cloak”). However, her conflict remains mostly one-directional—once she boards, there’s little friction or contradictory impulse on the page. The final realization about the star transferring to her feels earned but also somewhat pre-packaged rather than born from a hard, dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has a clear core motive (to understand the cost of safety) and a legible shift from passive custodian to active keeper of truth. His interiority is somewhat abstract—more philosophical than sensorial—so we rarely feel contradictory impulses embodied on the page. The choice to play the piano and to “remain, not out of duty, but out of choice” is earned but could register with sharper emotional and physical specificity. Overall, strong, if a bit too serene and tidy for peak literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence comes through, but she lacks real internal contradiction or visible cost; she never seriously doubts or missteps. The pretender is more a function than a character. The moment when her heart quickens at the annotated book hints at deeper psychology but isn’t fully developed. The ending gives her a mild reconfiguration (from deceiver-hunter to seed of renewal) but without much emotional struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly sketched as a competent, contemplative scientist with specific habits (the tapping, her gaze, her history as a coral bleaching witness), and her curiosity about the atlas page feels motivated. The interiority is grounded in her work and worldview rather than generic angst. However, under real pressure we don’t see much contradictory impulse or cost, so the internal change at the end reads more as a clean realization than a hard-won shift under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation and inner state are clear, and her progression from drift to renewed purpose feels earned through the interaction with the stone circle and the opera glasses. The interiority is specific enough (bare feet on concrete, inherited glasses, memory of rebellion) to distinguish her from a stock “chosen one,” but her emotional struggle is relatively smooth, with limited on-page contradiction or real resistance. The final resolve—“She knew what she had to do”—lands, but without a sharply felt cost or visible flaw complicating that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is vivid and particular—an insurgent grandmother with plant-telepathy and a fraught relationship to tradition and regime—but her internal conflict is mostly told (“a gift she both cherished and feared”) rather than dramatized under pressure. Her motives are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. The brief interaction with the guard shows status dynamics but resolves too easily to deeply test her. The closing stance (choosing to lead a rebirth) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zara’s trauma, attachment to the photograph, and return to drawing create a coherent, specific inner life, and her micro-choices at the cliff edge and with the sketchpad are motivated and embodied. The freeze response at the precipice is well-rendered and linked to her history. However, the emotional progression edges into tidy epiphany (“she had found a way to carry her pain without being consumed by it”) and occasionally leans on abstract, therapy-adjacent phrasing rather than fully dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior life is vivid and consistent, with a clear emotional trajectory from paralysis to a fragile, earned resolve. Her motives—creative block, inherited pressure, fear of her own “necessary darkness”—are well grounded in her history with the cards and her grandmother. However, the shift from despair to renewed purpose comes a bit too cleanly, with little mess or backsliding at the moment of insight. More contradictory impulses on the page (e.g., a last-minute urge to flee the cards) would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief and determination are clearly motivated, and her micro-choices (releasing the drone, entering the tent, touching the vial, refusing to look away from the vision) align with those motives. The shift from anger toward quieter resolve is earned by what she witnesses of her brother, though it comes somewhat quickly and cleanly. Her interiority is specific enough to avoid stock grief, but the emotional contradiction (rage vs acceptance) could be more messily embodied under pressure. The other woman is more thematic mouthpiece than character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s duty-versus-curiosity conflict is clear and consistently embodied in her choices, especially the decision to access and copy the forbidden network. However, her interiority often leans on generic formulations (“her mind a storm of conflicting emotions,” “at what cost?”) rather than sharply particular perceptions. The job-specific perspective of a “cryogenic archivist” is underexploited in how she thinks and feels. The final stance—accepting she’s crossed a line with no going back—is motivated but could bear more idiosyncratic emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motives (pacifism, continuity through chaos, attachment to the farm) are clear and consistent, and her brief hesitation before taking the blade is a credible internal conflict. However, her emotions remain largely summarized and idealized rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions under pressure. Kael is functional but thin, existing mainly as a plot messenger and protector with little distinct interior texture. The final stance—that she has escaped her father’s legacy—feels a bit pre-declared rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to catch the goddess’s echo and restore the garden—is clear and consistent, and his cool, attentive temperament comes through in how he listens and mirrors the stars. However, his internal conflict is minimal; he never seems torn between competing impulses or costs, which flattens the emotional arc. The rail spike’s “secret” weight hints at a deeper relationship to objects and duty that the story doesn’t fully exploit. The goddess, while vivid as an image, functions more as an emblematic presence than as a relational crucible that tests or complicates Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor’s core drive (truth-seeking, observant, heir to a journalistic legacy) is clear and consistent, and her choices align with it. However, her internal conflict—regret vs. compulsion to investigate—is mostly stated rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses in scene. The emotional cost of her decision to expose the observatory remains abstract; she feels burdened but faces no concrete sacrifice. This keeps her from feeling fully particular or pressured in a way that would earn a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s guilt, skill, and history with translating baby cries create a specific, psychologically coherent protagonist. Her motivation to quiet the firmware’s “dissonance” is clear and consistent, and the discovery of the letters credibly intensifies her conflict. The internal shift—from avoidance to answering the mother via the child’s imagined voice—tracks emotionally, though it resolves a long-term trauma somewhat quickly and neatly. The ethical complexity of writing as the dead child is powerful but under-explored on the page, which slightly undercuts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to find meaning in the “unlearning”—is clear and consistently dramatized through her choices with the flake and the mandala. The “lilac unease” gives her emotions a particular color, and her mix of whimsy and gravity feels specific rather than generic. Internal conflict (seeking answers vs. honoring the hush and its cost) is present, though it stays relatively cerebral rather than deeply embodied. The closing shift—accepting mess and unease—is credible and earned but could land harder with more concrete, conflicted behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation and ethos (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) are clear and consistent, and her actions—staying, kneeling, reassembling the mosaic—align with that inner stance. However, her interiority is largely conceptual and idealized; we get more of her philosophy than her contradictory impulses or specific personal costs. “Retrocognitively trapped” is intriguing but under-dramatized as an active flaw rather than a label. The ending’s warmth feels somewhat untested by genuine doubt or failure, which blunts the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s characterization is clear and specific—an encore-seeking, theatrical ghost with synesthetic perception—and her motive to “lure possibility from the brink of despair” is consistently dramatized. The encounter with her despairing echo gives her a modest but real internal shift (“had found a piece of herself”). However, internal conflict is underplayed: she rarely hesitates or struggles, and the alternate self is more a foil than a fully pressured character. The result is strong but not yet deeply conflicted or costly characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation—using art to process the telepathy pill disaster—is clear, consistent, and drives every on-page action. Her “affectionate skeptic” stance comes through in her blend of doubt and care, though we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or costly ambivalence under pressure. Emotions are grounded in body and environment (static in the air, cool geode, fatigue) rather than abstract labels. The final resolve to continue her work is believable but carries limited felt cost, which keeps the arc from fully deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s vocation, curiosity, and sense of purpose are clear and consistent, and her reactions to the fossil’s phenomena are believable within the premise. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or real fear—she mostly welcomes each escalation—which flattens her arc. Key shifts (“Her motivation deepened”; “She had become the voice of the unknown”) are told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The final sense of purpose is earned enough for this length but comes with minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s vocation, task, and broad motivation are clear, and there are a few embodied touches (“hands trembling slightly”) that anchor her interiority. However, her inner life remains largely unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk in succeeding or failing. Her final shift (from deciphering prophecy to carrying possibility forward) feels more stated than hard-won. The endurance/cost component is faint, which limits the depth of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (atonement, “fixing what’s broken”) is clear and consistent, and her history as a burned spy gives that motive weight. Her interiority is mostly concrete and particular, though often shaded toward abstraction rather than sharply embodied contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation (not taking the pill, choosing to move forward) is plausibly earned by the letter and prior setup, but the cost of that choice remains somewhat gently sketched rather than sharply felt. More on-page friction between her fear, caution, and desire to act would deepen her as an individual.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The coachman’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his inward turn toward recognizing the “palimpsest promise” reads as an authentic, if quiet, shift. However, he remains largely archetypal; we get little in the way of idiosyncratic contradiction or embodied emotional struggle. His epiphany comes smoothly rather than through visible internal friction, so the change carries limited felt cost. The cloaked figure is a functional mouthpiece rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her shift from solitary inquiry to teaching others tracks logically. However, she’s rendered mostly as a serene, inherently kind seeker; there’s almost no on-page internal contradiction or pressure that forces difficult trade-offs. The glass dimming when her thoughts turn “inward or harsh” is mentioned but never actually dramatized, so we don’t see her wrestle with less flattering impulses. Her final peace comes without much visible emotional cost, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is clearly sketched—her gardening, belief in small acts of care, and curiosity about the lockmaster’s tool feel specific and coherent, and her choice to descend and reveal the tooth arises credibly from these traits. However, her interior conflict is minimal; she rarely embodies contradictory impulses under pressure. The lockmaster remains more emblematic than fully human, mainly serving as a mirror for her outlook. The final “kindred spirit” realization lands emotionally but without much visible cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clearly articulated (“translate isolation into independence”) and linked to the reincarnation memory, but her interiority stays relatively smooth and unconflicted, with little sense of competing impulses under pressure. She moves from edge to core to orb without serious doubt, fear, or resistance, so the final transformation feels more granted than earned. Emotional embodiment is present (her boots sinking, clutching the sundial) but seldom deepens into character-specific contradiction. The arc is coherent but lacks the textured struggle expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her profession as a love-letter ghostwriter gives her a slightly distinct lens on connection. However, she faces almost no real internal conflict; there are few contradictory impulses or moments where her values are genuinely tested. The epiphany arrives smoothly, without much struggle or ambivalence on the page. Her emotional experience is pleasant and coherent but not especially complex or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s competence, wariness, and stubbornness are clear and reasonably consistent, and her choice to interfere subtly rather than block the signal aligns with that. However, her inner life remains fairly generalized—“cautiously hopeful,” “determined,” “grit”—without much contradictory impulse or embodied emotional texture. Hank functions only as a stock pressure source and doesn’t deepen her characterization. The final stance (“she would stay vigilant”) feels plausible but not strongly earned as a painful or conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core traits—claustrophobic yet driven, prudently adventurous, haunted by her father—are clearly established and consistently motivate her actions, especially pushing through the tight passage and then reframing her fear at the climax. Interiority is solid but somewhat generalized at times (“her mind racing with possibilities”), and her final transformation from fear to strength comes quickly with limited dramatized struggle in the peak moment. The relationship with her father is emotionally effective but lightly sketched, serving more as mythic backstory than a fully textured bond. The cost of change—what she truly risks or gives up by “embracing the mutiny”—remains more thematic than concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly defined—face-blind, methodical, driven by a need to see “beyond surface features”—and her behavior in the quarry aligns with these traits. The fear/determination split when the figure appears gives her some dimensionality. However, her internal conflict is mostly declared rather than dramatized; contradictory impulses don’t grind against each other in scene so much as get summarized. The closing “shift” in her empathy feels a bit tidy, with limited on-page cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core drive (honoring her great-uncle and uncovering the truth) is clear and tracks consistently into her actions with some embodied emotion (“spongey dread” vs. nervously confident behavior). However, her internal conflict never sharpens into a specific moral or emotional bind at the climax; we’re told she understands “the true cost of bravery” but not made to feel what that cost is for her in concrete terms. The final choice feels thematically right but somewhat generalized because her competing impulses (personal reunion, public restoration, planetary safety) aren’t dramatized against one another. Her great-uncle, when he appears, primarily functions as exposition and validation rather than as a relational crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Bridge-Song’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and the interiority stays focused on curiosity and purpose, but there’s little contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. Motivation (“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) is restated rather than dramatized through difficult tradeoffs or moments of doubt. Emotional response to the hitchhiker’s disappearance feels oddly calm and abstract, with more attention on motif language than embodied grief, fear, or urgency. The closing choice to step into the sanctuary and play reads as natural but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias has a clear, consistent motivation (understanding his father and the place) and a defined trait (calm perceptiveness), but his inner life remains relatively undisturbed—there’s little felt struggle or contradiction as he moves through the train. His emotional response to finding the journal and confronting the partner is too smoothly processed for the implied weight of legacy and regret. The final “peace” feels more asserted than fought for, with minimal visible cost. Secondary character (the partner) exists mainly to validate Elias’s calm rather than truly pressure him.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s driving motives (decoding the inscriptions, healing her own fractured past) are clear and consistent, and her interiority is gently rendered. However, her internal conflict remains largely implied rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of real resistance or competing impulses, so the final shift toward “no longer alone” feels somewhat pre-ordained. The “heals with words” trait is asserted but never really tested under pressure. The change at the end reads more like a calm affirmation than a costly, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eira’s motivation (to uncover what mirrors don’t show) is clear and coherently tied to her guarded nature and past failure, and her internal shift at the end feels earned. The interplay between “warlike serenity” and inner turmoil gives her some dimensionality. However, her emotions often arrive in generalized, thematic language rather than sharply individuated, embodied moments, which blunts specificity. The final acceptance costs her something conceptually, but that cost could be more sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—mend the covenant, find the “intersection of dreams”—and her interiority is present, but often in generalized terms (“anxious elation,” “purposefully curious mind”) rather than character-specific textures. Her choices (entering the maze, placing the clipping) align with her stated goals but lack palpable internal contradiction or genuine hesitation. The scars as reminders of past cost hint at depth but are not dramatized in the present, which softens the sense of a live, costly decision. As a result, she feels defined more by role and function than by idiosyncratic personality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core drive—to mend souls at the expense of her own freedom—is clear, consistent, and paid off in her final choice to stay. Her sacrifice of her voice and binding to the orchard give her credible texture, and the apparition of her older self effectively externalizes an internal path-not-taken. Internal contradictions (resentment vs devotion, fear vs commitment) are present but could be more sharply dramatized rather than mostly stated. The older self is more thematic mouthpiece than full character, slightly flattening the relationship tension.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and grounded in his history as a roadie and appraiser, and his emotional state is embodied through tactile engagement with the cloth and the space. His conflict—identity and purpose after compounded failures—is clear and consistent. The final choice to pocket the cloth and step outside reads as a believable, if modest, stance shift. The main limitation is that the epiphany lands a bit cleanly and rhetorically tidy, with less felt contradiction in the moment than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliara’s motivation is clear and consistent—haunted by her mentor’s departure, driven to recover lost knowledge—and the kindly, methodical trait mostly shows in her cautious approach and nurturing of the tree. The internal tension between caution and yearning is present but lightly sketched, with feelings often labeled rather than deeply embodied (“a mix of fear and excitement”). Her final sense of peace is motivated but arrives a bit too smoothly, without much visible struggle under pressure. The piece hints at richer contradiction than it fully dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, worldview, and guiding motivation are clearly and specifically rendered, and her reflective interiority around identity feels character-rooted rather than generic. Her actions (using the creel, orb, and pool) align with that motivation. However, under real pressure she encounters little genuine friction or mistake, and her realization about identity as process lands a bit tidy, with limited sense of cost or unresolved contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s role and longing for “something deeper” are clear, and her shift from bureaucratic inspector to spiritual conduit is legible and motivated. However, her inner life stays generalized—little concrete contradiction, fear, or flaw complicates her choices. The decision to ignore her “tight” timeframe costs her nothing on the page, so we don’t see value trade-offs under pressure. She reads more as an emblematic seeker than a fully particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner contradictions are clear and specific: the tension between the relief of clarity and the pain of unfiltered memory feels lived-in, not generic. Her actions (coming to the station, cataloging memories on the bellows, choosing to trace her own map) align with that drive. The medication history and guilt provide credible psychic pressure rather than a neat excuse. The secondary character is thin but does add a relational crucible moment that nudges her stance without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she comes seeking answers and accepts the role of conduit—but remains relatively simple and untested. Interiority has some nice texture (“cautious exuberance”) yet skirts cliché and doesn’t expose many contradictions or blind spots. Her choices (entering, following the hum, writing, leaving) are logical but low-cost, so the final resolve feels more designated than earned. The piece gestures toward a deeper transformation without fully dramatizing the struggle it would require.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s professional focus, plant-telepathy, and moral calculus (dream vs Dominion) are clearly motivated and consistent, and her choice to use the violin tracks with what we’ve seen. However, her internal conflict feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized; the “mulberry ache” is named but not deeply embodied in specific, contradictory impulses in the decisive moment. Her struggle between research/understanding and direct intervention is gestured at but not really tested. The cost she feels afterward is credible but somewhat lightly sketched for the magnitude of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive (“one last spark before oblivion”) is clear and her gentleness/precision feel character-specific, but her internal conflict between fearing and embracing stillness is only lightly dramatized and resolves with minimal struggle (“Teach me,” she whispered). The traveler functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a pressured character with wants. Her final shift of purpose is legible yet emotionally under-earned for top-tier work, with little tangible cost shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role as a devoted caretaker and seeker of contentment is clear and consistent, and her choice to follow the hairpin’s map reads as aligned with an established decisiveness. However, internal conflict is relatively muted: her unrest and the “forgiving the unforgivable” betrayal are summarized rather than dramatized, so contradictory impulses under pressure never fully materialize on the page. Her transformation toward contentment feels somewhat quick and low-cost, more granted by magic than wrestled with. The characterization is solid and coherent but not yet complex enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s core motivation (“to welcome nuance into certainty”) is clear and consistent, and his method provides some distinctive interiority. However, his emotional life feels abstract and largely unpressured; we rarely see conflicting impulses or real strain as he works. Mara is an idea more than a person, so relational pressure never materializes on the page. The final sense of “fulfillment” arrives without a visible personal cost or tension having been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—fear of the chaos full disclosure might bring versus the mounting need to reveal—is clear and consistent, and backwards aging personalizes her worldview. However, the internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices, which softens the impact of her final decision. Lines like “her heart heavy but unburdened” lean on abstraction instead of embodied contradiction. The change from withholding to revealing feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation and inner lens are clear and consistent, and the shift from seeking external appraisal to internal navigation is coherent and earned. However, the interiority leans abstract (“their resolve was as unyielding as the stone beneath their feet”) and rarely shows contradictory impulses or embodied ambivalence. We do not see real friction between duty, doubt, fear, or desire; the character mostly confirms what the narration has already suggested. This keeps the arc from feeling as psychologically complex as it could at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eli’s core motivation—valuing manual, heartfelt magic in an automated world—is clear and consistent, and his choice to risk mist walking under pressure aligns with it. However, his interiority leans on generalized language (“sense of clarity and purpose”) rather than character-specific contradiction. The panic in the trap moment is credible but brief, with little layered conflict between fear and ideals. His final shift feels somewhat tidy, with limited on-page cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s longing and quiet curiosity are clear and consistent, and his decision to follow the light and accept the vow tracks with what we’re shown. However, his inner life stays generalized—“a longing he couldn’t name,” “drawn by its enigmatic pull”—rather than sharply particular to him. The revelation that he’s always been driven “to discover the color of sound” feels retrofitted more than earned from earlier beats. There’s little sense of internal contradiction or cost beyond a gentle shift from passive longing to articulated quest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira’s core motivation (to find meaning and possibly rebirth for the contracted universe) is clear and mostly consistent, and her role as the village’s lot-caster gives her some specificity. However, she experiences little real internal contradiction—doubt is stated but never truly paralyzes or warps her choices, and once the essence appears, she pivots to certainty almost too smoothly. Emotional responses are somewhat generalized (“her heart raced,” “quietly enthusiastic”) rather than deeply embodied or idiosyncratic. The closing shift to determined navigator feels mildly earned but carries little visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s grief and shaken purpose are clearly motivated, and her choice to perform the naming ritual and then reclaim her scythe feels earned. Interiority is specific enough to avoid stock heartbreak, especially in the way she projects her sorrow onto the sea monsters. However, her internal conflict runs on a relatively single track—there’s limited on-page push-pull between despair and purpose in the moment of action. The closing realization borders on tidy (“Her heartbreak had not been in vain”), sanding away some potential ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliard’s motivation—naive faith that effort can mend both the bell and the world—is clear and consistently dramatized, especially in his patient, almost ritualistic work. His interiority is specific enough (ancestral devotion, doubt about “brittle” efforts) to feel individual, not generic. However, internal contradiction is mild; his doubts never seriously contest his hope, so his final stance feels more like continuation than a costly shift. The change is credible but not deeply earned under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is clearly motivated—his vigilance and desire to restore the town’s memory are consistent and believable—but he rarely comes under real psychological pressure. Interiority is present yet somewhat generalized; we don’t see genuinely conflicting impulses or moral ambiguity when he decides to reveal these histories. His “precisely humane” quality is more told than stress-tested. The final satisfaction comes a bit too easily, without a visible personal cost or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and her small sequence of choices (reading the starlings, following the flame, risking the altar) align with her stated drive to unify logic and intuition. However, her “secretly sentimental” trait is told rather than dramatized, and her internal conflict is too frictionless to feel truly tested. The emotional experience remains mostly summarized in elevated language rather than embodied in specific, contradictory sensations or mistakes. The final shift in self-conception comes easily, with little visible cost or failure along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    The seeker’s role, mission, and burden are clear, and the parachute buckle grounds a bit of personal history and motivation. However, emotions are mostly stated in abstract terms (“weight of the watcher’s burden,” “unwavering focus”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or conflicted impulses. The internal tension between inventiveness and responsibility is named but never dramatized in a sharp, in-scene clash of urges. The final “triumph” comes without a felt personal cost, so the internal arc remains shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motivation (end ego-numbness, reclaim self) is clear and consistent, and the final act of shattering the jar tracks with that drive, but the interior conflict is summarized rather than lived in the body (“Fear, anger, sadness, joy—they came in waves”). Contradictory impulses—fight vs. embrace the duplicate—are asserted more than dramatized in specific, scene-bound choices. Lira functions as a stock wise mentor whose pressure is mostly verbal, with little felt cost or resistance. The closing change of integration is earned at a conceptual level but feels emotionally under-struggled on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and protectiveness are clear and consistent, and his profession colors his outlook in a plausible way. However, his interiority stays fairly straightforward—there’s little genuine contradiction or moral friction, even when he senses the seed “felt different.” The pivotal act of dropping the key into the brook is motivated mostly by a vague “strange pull,” not a layered conflict of values. The closing sense of “this was his purpose” feels lightly earned rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his embodied connection to the pull cord gives him some specificity. However, his inner life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete, character-peculiar terms, and we see little genuine contradiction or moral friction in his choices. The claim that he is “mournfully eager” is more stated than tested under pressure. The final glimmer of hope feels earned but comes at relatively low visible cost beyond generic exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives (homesickness vs duty to the library) are clear and consistent, and her final choice to wait is credibly earned from those pressures. Her interiority is concrete enough to feel particular (the “interiorizing exteriors” moment is strong), though some feelings are summarized in abstract terms. The keeper is thinly sketched but functions effectively as a pressure source rather than a fully rounded character. I’d like one more embodied moment of real struggle before she refuses the key to deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive arc from “hopeless alchemist” to someone who embraces transformation is coherent and rooted in her history of failure, and we do feel her interior struggle in the ritual. However, the conflict is largely framed in abstract terms (“stifling destiny,” “creative destruction”), and we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses in-scene—once the idea lands, her transition feels relatively tidy. Her stoicism and sensitivity are mostly told rather than dramatized through clashing actions or self-sabotage under pressure. The final realization, while earned enough, resolves with minimal visible cost or lingering ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s role, competence, and motivation are clear, and her micro-choices around the console and the shard track logically with her goal. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict; the “assumptions” she discards are conceptual rather than viscerally fraught, so there’s little sense of risk or cost. Her emotions stay in a narrow band of calm focus and faint satisfaction, which limits depth. The final self-realization (“she had found herself”) feels more declared than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to restore *The Chronos* and its passengers—and her resilience is dramatized in her calm against the rift and the transient’s warning. However, she lacks genuine internal contradiction under pressure; she is almost entirely unwavering, so we don’t see competing impulses. Emotional experience is largely summarized rather than embodied, and the transient functions more as a mouthpiece than a fully pressuring presence. The closing sense that she is “forever changed” is told rather than earned through a visible shift in her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core drive (“to discover the texture of connection”) is clear and consistently motivates her choice to continue weaving despite the shadow figure’s warning. We get a glimpse of formative backstory with her mother and childhood drawings that ties neatly into her present vocation. However, interior conflict is sketched rather than deeply dramatized—the fear of unraveling and the compulsion to connect never quite grind against each other in embodied, contradictory impulses. The emotional texture remains somewhat abstract and elevated, with limited specific bodily response under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly motivated and coherent—her attachment to starlight and resistance to “obsolescence” feel rooted in her profession and temperament, and Kael functions as a credible foil. However, her interiority rarely reveals live contradiction or genuine irrationality under pressure; she moves from conviction to action without much inner friction. The “balancedly curious” trait is named but never really dramatized as a conflict-driving flaw or tension. The final resonance reads as an affirmation of what she already believes rather than a costly reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motive—to protect “vulnerable voices”—is clear and consistent, and the hearing aid / photograph decisions track with that. However, she faces almost no genuine resistance, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or costly trade-offs that would deepen her. Emotions are often summarized rather than made idiosyncratically embodied (“Her heart quickened; she knew this was her task now”). The final resolve to keep protecting stories feels more like reaffirmation of an already-stated trait than an earned shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s drive (debt to Voss, promise to “stand by the unremembered”) and her claustrophobia are clearly established and consistently motivate her actions. Interiority is specific enough—panic, ragged breath, narrowing walls—but could dig deeper into contradictory impulses in the key beats. The shift from phobia-dominated to managed fear at the end is credible but a bit tidy for this level. Voss as a relationship anchor is effective, though the on-page dynamic remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand the error of her own “death” and fetch wisdom from failure—is clear and consistent, and her emotional focus on the shard, ink, and ghost feels particular rather than generic. However, her inner life remains relatively smooth and unconflicted: we don’t see real contradictory impulses or a meaningful price for her final acceptance. Her anxiety tic (counting heartbeats) is evocative but doesn’t significantly shape her decisions. The closing shift (“the death certificate…no longer defined her”) feels earned enough, but the cost of getting there is underdramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s core motivation and role as storyteller are clear and consistent, and her physical responses (trembling hands, glowing veins) ground her emotionally. However, she remains largely defined by her mission and specialness rather than by conflicting impulses or a more layered inner life. The sacrifice feels somewhat generic because we don’t see a specific, personal cost beyond fatigue. As a result, her transformation into “guardian” lands more as a title shift than a deeply earned internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s goal and grief are clear, and her fixation on the arrowhead plus the lost colleague gives her a credible spine. However, her inner conflict (bitterness vs acceptance) is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. The key turn—she laughs and lets go—is a bit sudden and tidy for the depth of trauma implied. The missing cryptid feels more like a symbolic mirror than a pressure-bearing character, which keeps the transformation somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive to save the orchard through music is clear and consistent, and the locust shell links neatly to her curiosity and intuition. However, her internal conflict is described more conceptually (“the gap between knowing and understanding”) than dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene. Once she identifies the shell as a signal, her path feels almost entirely aligned and untroubled. The final transformation reads earned enough but lacks a sense of personal cost or difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s role, history with his sister, and quietly defiant ethic are clear and coherent, and his actions with Luma track well with that motivation. The mailman-as-bridge concept is strong and character-specific. Internal contradiction (fear vs. hope, loyalty vs. self-preservation) is only lightly dramatized on the page rather than truly grinding him. The emotional cost of his choice lands, but his inner life could cut deeper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    The carpenter’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his craft plus muteness give him some specificity, but his inner life stays largely on the surface. We don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure; once he finds the halo fragment, he moves in a straight line toward wonder and epiphany. The emotional beats are summarized rather than dramatized (“his heart full with a sense of purpose he had long forgotten”), which flattens complexity. The final realization feels somewhat unearned because we haven’t watched him struggle against a competing desire or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear (to “reawaken something lost” and find/protect the place where stories live), and her habits and ritualistic method feel consistent with her “odd-hour librarian” persona. However, her inner life is sketched more than deeply dramatized; we don’t see much contradiction, fear, or wavering as the stakes rise. Her emotional arc from obsession to guardianship is conceptually sound but largely asserted in a few lines rather than earned through conflicted moment-to-moment choices. The lack of visible cost or internal struggle at the climax keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire and method are clear and consistent, and her artistic process tracks well with her emotional state. However, her inner life stays relatively one-note—haunted longing that moves to serene acceptance—without much contradiction or real friction along the way. The final “courage to create it anew” feels more declared than earned through a difficult on-page choice, softening the sense of cost. The lack of visible internal struggle undercuts what could be a sharper, more individuated transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara has a clear goal rooted in her mother and a long-standing fear, and her locksmith competence feels integrated with her actions. However, her internal conflict (fear vs. boldness) is mostly told rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. Embodied emotion is present but often generic (“tremor in her heart”) rather than character-specific. The final release choice feels motivated but carries little on-page sense of cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (recovering stolen memories) and core trait (compulsive curiosity) are clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the environment feels particular. However, she encounters little real resistance, and we rarely see live internal contradiction or a visible cost to her drive. Her emotions skew toward summary (“a sadness Elara recognized”) rather than complex, embodied turmoil under pressure. The final shift to “knew she was exactly where she was meant to be” is earned enough but low-stakes and not strongly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation (quietly mentoring resilience through her archival work) is clear and particular, and her nervous habits and “combative tenderness” give her a distinct emotional texture. Internal conflict is present but mild—there’s little sense that she might genuinely fail or choose wrongly. Some key beats are summarized in abstract language (“Her own life was a testament to this…”) instead of being dramatized, which slightly flattens complexity. The closing resolve feels earned but low-cost, more confirmation than true transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her reverence for the orchard and the seed comes through. However, she has almost no internal contradiction or struggle; she is uniformly wise, gentle, and sure. Her choices (to plant the seed, to trust the ritual) face no resistance and reveal little new about her. The result is a likable but idealized protagonist lacking complexity for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to ground spirits and indirectly mend herself—is clear and consistently dramatized, and her profession and backstory with her mother’s mask give her a particular texture. Interiority is present and embodied (“silence pressing heavier on her chest”), but her internal conflict (duty vs. personal grief) stays fairly smooth and rarely produces sharp contradictory impulses in-scene. The closing realization about honoring stories risks feeling a touch declarative rather than emerging through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core traits—perceptive, methodical, empathetic—are clearly articulated and her actions (comparing footage, deciding to dig) track cleanly with them. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradiction; her “shielded openness” is told more than dramatized. Emotional states are summarized (“her heart heavy with reverence”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The closing stance as “guardian of silence” is thematically apt but carries minimal visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—curious, analytic, drawn to mortality as a puzzle—and her final reframing of “letting go” is credibly earned by the prior beats. The marine archaeologist detail grounds her competence and her methodical approach to the wreck. However, her emotional life remains somewhat abstract; we feel her curiosity far more than any sharp, contradictory pull (e.g., fear vs. compulsion), which limits depth. The relationship with Death as a quasi-character is intriguing but under-exploited as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to help the ghost articulate its existence and thereby also answer her own sense of unheardness—is clear and consistent, and her professional background as a cryptographer dovetails well with her artistic identity. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity, self-preservation vs. compassion) play out in real time. Her emotional experience is mostly summarized rather than embodied under pressure, so the final realization about “the true power of her gift” feels somewhat pre-declared. The arc reads more like a graceful fulfillment of destiny than a choice with real internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her grief and curiosity feel grounded in concrete actions (lingering in the library, pausing at the portrait). However, her interiority remains relatively straightforward; we don’t see much contradiction or real fraying under pressure. The final realization lands emotionally but a bit tidily, with minimal sense of a path truly foreclosed or a cost borne beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular, with nice touches like classifying clouds by emotion and cherishing the mentor’s telescope. However, her internal conflict is thin: she moves from belief to confirmation without much genuine doubt or competing impulse, so the leap into the cloud feels spiritually apt but not heavily contested. The suggestion that “someone—or something—wanted her here” never sharpens into a concrete pressure on her choices. The closing self-identification as “guardian” arrives easily, without much visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s sensory worldview and face-blindness are vivid and specific, and her calm focus under pressure feels consistent. However, her core motivation (“for the challenge it posed”) stays abstract, and we don’t see much real internal contradiction or cost beyond mild unease. The climax lacks a moment where she is genuinely torn or degraded by stress; she proceeds competently from entry to success. The closing reorientation of her feelings about stillness is nice but feels more declared than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (curiosity, loyalty to Thorne, desire for discovery) is clear and consistent, and her actions all flow logically from it. Interiority has some specificity (“sociable isolation,” the phrasebook as companion) but rarely shows true contradiction or cost under pressure. Her final shift—from lonely apprentice to connected successor—is believable but low-stakes and emotionally gentle. The lack of real inner conflict or hard choice keeps this below top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her internal focus on “rhythm of repair” gives her some specificity. However, her emotional life remains relatively smooth; we don’t see strong contradictory impulses or a serious moment of doubt in the hall of mirrors despite the “no one returns” setup. The visions offer insight but not much genuine struggle. The closing confidence feels earned enough but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characters are clear and role-defined (altruistic ghost, restless caretaker, specialist allies) with coherent, simple motivations, but they remain archetypal rather than individuated. Kael’s “restlessness” and attachment to his grandmother’s stories never deepen into contradictory impulses or hard choices. The allies are functionally sketched—botanist, sculptor, musician—without internal conflict or real friction among them. Elara’s altruism is stated but never tested or complicated on the page, so change and cost in characterization stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, worldview, and core motive are clear and specific, and we see her act under pressure (bleeding onto the shard, recommitting after doubt). Her emotional life is embodied rather than labeled, and the link between her cracks and the puppet’s works well. Internal conflict (fear of failure vs. determination) is present but not deeply knotted or surprising, and there’s limited contradiction beyond the obvious. The closing stance—accepting ongoing fragility while choosing to keep mending—feels earned but could carry sharper visible cost or moral tension to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (resentful duty tempered by stubborn care and secret rebellion) is clear and consistent, and her choices—saving the traveler, using the nut on the tree—flow logically from that mix. Interiority is concrete enough (“she hated it—the isolation… yet, she stayed”) without lapsing into therapy-speak. However, her internal conflict remains relatively straightforward; we don’t see truly contradictory impulses under pressure so much as a noble temperament fulfilling its obvious course. The final self-definition (“guide, breaker of curses…”) risks reading as slightly tidy and declarative rather than fully earned through messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is coherent and specific—her lens as a polymer chemist and grieving sister feels lived-in, and her shift from avoidance to a readiness to reconnect is credibly motivated. However, the emotional arc leans on somewhat generalized formulations (“atone,” “distance she’d allowed to grow”) rather than dramatized, conflicted impulses in the present moment. The decision to change is relatively smooth and tidy, with limited sense of ongoing self-contradiction as she chooses. Strong but not yet at the level of fully fraught, high-end literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and her choices (climbing, cutting, uncorking) all align with that drive. However, she moves through the piece with very little on-page contradiction or real doubt, so her inner life feels more emblematic than humanly fraught. Emotions are more implied by setting than embodied in her body or thought. The final “change” is large in the world but modest in her personal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive—smoothing the edges of painful memories—is clear and consistently tied to her actions, and her sensory gift is well-embodied through the “tasting” of etched regrets. However, she encounters little genuine inner contradiction; she endures, but we don’t see impulses in real conflict (revulsion vs duty, self-protection vs compassion) in the moment of greatest pressure. Her emotions are mostly summarized in elevated diction rather than rendered through messy, character-particular thinking. The final shift (lightened by taking on remorse) feels earned but somewhat easy because she never truly wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and occupation are clear and consistent, and her decision to act by climbing the tower and singing aligns with her established traits. However, her interiority remains largely summarized and idealized, with little contradictory impulse or real moral friction under pressure. Mr. Kovar’s brief moment gives a glimpse of specific character but the townspeople are mostly a symbolic crowd. The emotional shift at the end feels somewhat costless and tidy rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—an ex-aerospace engineer turned “archaeologist of abandoned dreams” is strong and consistent. However, her internal conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized, so contradictory impulses under pressure never quite ignite on the page. The risk to her mind from the synaptic process is mentioned but not felt moment-to-moment, which softens her choices. Her closing realization about being a “keeper of memories” lands but feels slightly too tidy for how little genuine resistance we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her archivist mindset fits the puzzle-solving task, but she remains largely uncontradicted and emotionally smooth. We rarely see genuine internal conflict, fear, or irrationality under pressure—her “latent blaze” is asserted more than dramatized. Her final acceptance of responsibility is credible but costs her nothing tangible on the page. The character feels functional and coherent rather than deeply particular or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—she wants to “create music in a silent world” and that value governs all of her micro-choices. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal contradiction or resistance; the work goes smoothly and her confidence is never troubled, so we never see her tested. Interiority has some specificity (reading cracks as sheet music, “empathy in motion”) but leans toward summary over embodied, conflicted feeling under pressure. The final sense of fulfillment is earned but low-cost, more affirmation than change.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alara’s motivation (questioning the covenant, wanting to redeem silence) is clear and consistent, and her chess practice and worry stone nicely externalize her inner life. However, her emotional arc moves in a smooth, largely unresisted glide from exile to clarity, with little sense of genuine inner contradiction or degradation under pressure. The revelation that exile is a “chance to redefine her purpose” feels somewhat unearned because we do not see her truly doubt or fail on the page. Strong interiority, but not yet the kind of knotty, self-opposed psyche expected at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding her grandmother’s silences as a path to empathy—is clear and consistently carried through, and her embodied ritual with the clasp shows a specific way of being in the world. However, she’s almost entirely without flaws or contradictory impulses on the page; there’s little sense of doubt, impatience, or resistance even as she performs a charged act. The emotional arc lands (a deepened sense of identity and connection), but the change is relatively gentle and unsurprising given how aligned she already is with empathy at the start. A bit more friction or self-deception would make her feel less idealized and more human.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s ambition, sensory gift, and vague inner emptiness are clearly established and stay consistent, and her final reorientation toward a lighter, more present way of living is credibly grounded in the preceding beats. However, her conflict remains mostly internal and low-pressure, with little in-the-moment contradiction between competing impulses beyond generalized longing vs. drive. The epiphany leans on explicit articulation (“The wisdom of the flower taught her…”) rather than fully dramatized struggle. Still, we get a distinct, non-generic interiority with plausible emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation (finding the source of resilience) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a pilot/orchard specialist comes through. However, her interiority remains fairly generic—she feels wonder and urgency but with little contradiction or sharply personal texture. The final “she had discovered… not just for the planet, but for herself” epiphany is asserted more than earned through specific internal struggle. Her decision to dedicate herself to the echoes is plausible but comes with no visible cost or conflicted feeling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s professional motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her attention to detail tracks with the investigative role. However, interior conflict is thin: she rarely shows contradictory impulses or moral hesitation, only efficient deduction plus a light wash of solemnity. The “rapidly adapting mind” is asserted more than dramatized. Her closing stance—rededicating herself to foresight—feels credible but not especially costly or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—rooted in her village’s loss of wonder—and her synesthetic perception gives her interiority some specificity. However, once the present-tense ritual begins, she encounters little resistance; her fears are named but not dramatized as genuine competing impulses. The final “quiet triumph” feels earned but largely because nothing seriously threatens it. A touch more on-page wobble or potential failure would deepen both her arc and the cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s core drive (atonement and understanding after the failed orb) is clear and consistent, and her hesitation before playing the flute tracks with that history. However, her interiority leans on generalized language (“haunted her dreams,” “felt a sense of purpose”) rather than character-specific textures. The fear/desire conflict is present but resolved too smoothly; we don’t see real degradation of thought or messy contradiction under peak stress. Her final stance feels credible but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s yearning to decode “the mathematics of emotion” and his identity-blurring habit give him a distinct interior life, and his overwhelm during the empathy surge feels motivated. However, emotions are often rendered in generalized, abstract terms (“complex tapestry,” “essence of human connection”) rather than sharply embodied sensations. His final understanding of empathy reads slightly like a declared realization rather than a fully dramatized internal conflict resolving on the page. The arc is coherent and credible, but not yet textured or specific enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s nervous competence, attachment to Alaric, and susceptibility to wonder are clear and mostly embodied (her reactions to the pendant, the cold, the ridge). However, her internal conflict is soft: she’s uneasy but never pushed into a genuinely difficult or contradictory choice, and the “surge of something…wonder, perhaps, or purpose” verges on generic epiphany. The scholar is thinly drawn and functions more as exposition than as a crucible for her character. The final shift toward shared purpose with the relic is motivated but carries little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—her belief in emotional residue and her methodical preparation feel lived-in. The moment she encounters the prism’s grief lands emotionally and shifts her stance from clinical curiosity to humility. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild; there’s limited sense of competing impulses or genuine risk to her self-concept, so the change feels gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s basic motivation (a half-understood mission to carry a message) and temperament (wistful, solitary craftsperson) are clear and consistent, and her key choices—following the puzzle, leaving home, stepping onto the bridge—track logically. However, her inner life remains somewhat generalized; we don’t see sharp contradictory impulses or a vivid hierarchy of values under pressure. The “sacrifice” of leaving home is told rather than felt in embodied detail, which softens the cost of the final choice. As a result, the closing transformation reads graceful but not deeply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motivation—to risk himself to revive the planet for his people—is clear and consistent, and his quiet determination tracks cleanly from forge to core. However, his inner conflict about “bartering his awakening” is mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene, so the trade’s psychological cost feels under-explored. Embodied emotion is light; we get resolve more than textured fear, doubt, or irrationality under pressure. The final sense of being “more and less himself” is intriguing but too briefly handled to fully land as a complex character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (uncovering a withheld truth) is clear and consistent, and her profession as a sensory map maker gives her a mildly distinctive lens on events. However, she experiences little genuine internal conflict: her emotional journey moves quickly from curiosity to revelation to acceptance without visible resistance or cost. The “guardian of the weave” realization reads as a bestowed role more than an earned, pressured choice. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a publishable-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—reticent, competent, quietly attuned to his environment—and his shift from vague ache to conscious guardianship feels earned by the chain of events. However, his inner conflict remains relatively simple; we don’t see much genuine resistance, only dawning recognition. The line “That glow had always fascinated him, a luminescent ache that reminded him of something he couldn’t quite name” is strong, but the later realization resolves that ache a bit too smoothly. More visible cost or ambivalence at the moment of accepting the role would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Herald has a clear desire (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) and a consistent temperament (laughter shading into awe and resolve), but interior conflict remains thin. Panic flickers and is “quickly replaced by curiosity,” short-circuiting sustained tension. Their realization that “this was no accident” arrives very easily, with little on-page struggle or ambiguity. The final acceptance of their role lacks a visible personal cost or contradiction that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is clear, rooted in his donor heart and sensitivity to others’ stories, and his gentleness with the grieving woman feels earned. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped; he never seems truly torn or at risk, just serenely insightful. The woman’s grief is sketched effectively but remains archetypal, with little individuating texture beyond “husband died a year ago.” The final “purpose” he adopts is consistent but costs him nothing on the page, muting the sense of a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated and competently sketched—the maintenance-worker vantage point is distinctive and his curiosity about “what trees witness” has some specificity. However, his interiority leans toward generalized summary (“the resilience of the human spirit”) rather than textured, character-particular thought. There is almost no contradictory impulse or real struggle on the page; once he feels the pull, he moves in a straight emotional line. The closing realization feels more like a narratorial thesis than a hard-won, idiosyncratic shift in his psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to rekindle the realm through recovered songs—is clear and consistent, and her actions track with that aim. However, her “scattered memory keeper” nature is mostly asserted rather than dramatized, so her difficulty remembering the final thread feels conveniently solvable rather than deeply conflicted. Emotional beats (“her hands trembled,” “her breath catching”) are somewhat generic and don’t reveal much contradiction or specificity. The final transformation into “the weaver” lands conceptually but without much felt cost or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is sketched with a clear core (compassionate recluse, self-concealing, drawn to paradox) and her curiosity-to-resolution arc tracks cleanly. However, her inner conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in concrete moments, so contradictory impulses rarely collide on the page. The final choice to “hide no more” feels plausible but lightly earned, with minimal on-page cost or struggle. Thaddeus functions more as a mouthpiece than as a pressure-bearing character.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her gardening choices align with her desire to “find the sacred in the ordinary.” However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction or pressure—her doubts, fears, or selfish impulses never surface, so she feels more like an emblem than a person. The “tenuous absolution” she feels at the end is not sharply earned by specific earlier missteps or guilt. Characterization is solid but too safe for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and core motivation are clear and consistent, and the “orderly vs. called-to-something-greater” tension is nicely crystallized in “Her gently meticulous nature now clashed with a newfound urgency.” However, her interiority stays mostly at the level of articulated purpose rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses in-scene, so her shift reads more as declared than deeply struggled through. There’s little sense of real cost or genuine flaw beyond devoted competence, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a prestigious-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lila’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and we see her make purposeful choices under pressure. However, her internal conflict is minimal—there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk of backing down. Secondary characters are thin, functioning mostly as stock antagonists or informants. The closing “reluctant guardian” stance is believable but not deeply earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core paradox—“luminous skeptic” drawn to the unexplained yet rational—comes through clearly, and her motivation to understand the weather-carriers and her own glow is consistent. Interiority is present but light; we’re told her mind “raced” more than we inhabit that racing in concrete, character-specific thought. Her final choice to accept the forests’ call is plausible but low-cost, with little visible fear, doubt, or sacrifice in the moment. The cloaked figure functions more as an expositional mouthpiece than a character applying direct relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s fear versus creative hunger is clear and specific, with the lock, cave, and forgotten painting all reflecting an internal contradiction. Her realization and final choice to paint herself read emotionally coherent, but the shift is a bit tidy and fast, with relatively little on-page resistance once the note is found. Moments like “a call she had suppressed for years, fearing the chaos it might unleash” verge on summary/therapy-speak rather than dramatized conflict. Still, her actions align well with her motives, and the closing renunciation of her old pattern feels earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to recover lost conversations and understand the oasis’s disappearance—is clear and consistently rooted in her gift and isolation. Her emotional life is embodied enough (trembling hands, weight of silence) to feel particular, though internal contradiction (hope vs fear of what she’ll find) remains underplayed on the page. The key turn—accepting the bitter truth and deciding to inscribe it anyway—feels earned but could register more cost viscerally. Relationships are absent in-scene, so her isolation functions but the crucible is primarily between her and the city’s secret.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s goal (preserving wonder through her art) is clear and consistent, but she faces no meaningful internal contradiction or difficult choice. Her emotional life is summarized in abstractions (“sense of peace,” “heart full of hope”) rather than particular, embodied reactions. The seasonal muteness and devotion to truth could generate tension, yet here they never complicate her behavior or demand sacrifice. The final “change” is essentially restatement of her ongoing stance, not an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (preserve farm, resolve “static”) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the cost—loss of nostalgic vividness—lands. The blend of logic/emotion and role conflict (caretaker vs cared-for) gives her interiority texture. However, the piece leans on abstract labels (“fragmented wholeness,” “static”) rather than more idiosyncratic, embodied reactions at peak stress, which mutes complexity. The final shift toward “more android than caretaker” is earned but stated rather than dramatized in behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s characterization as a curious, attentive curator is clear and consistent, and her choice to engage with the mailbox feels motivated by her established love of hidden stories. However, her internal conflict is mild—there’s little sense of real risk or competing impulses, so the emotional cost of her decision never sharpens. Mrs. Ellis is sketched effectively but mainly as a functionary for exposition rather than a full pressure source. The final “found a purpose” realization is believable but lands a bit too cleanly, without mess or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation (liberating buried knowledge, turning vulnerability into strength) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a “lyrical code breaker” feels specific, but she faces almost no real resistance or internal contradiction. Her emotional life stays largely at the level of mission-driven resolve without concrete, embodied ambivalence. Actions align with stated motives, yet we don’t see her forced into a costly or painful choice. The result is a solid but somewhat emblematic characterization rather than a fully inhabited psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motivation (recovering his own lost memories) is clear, consistent, and plausibly tied to his profession and the motifs (wildflowers, coffee grounds, whale). Interiority is present but tends toward smooth, single-track yearning rather than layered, contradictory impulses under pressure. His key action—performing the ritual and stepping into the memory-space—aligns with his motives, but the emotional cost of that choice is under-dramatized on the page. The ending shift to “understanding” lands, yet it feels a bit too calm and unconflicted to be fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motive—to hush the prophecy and preserve balance—is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is pleasant but fairly generalized, with little character-specific contradiction or moral friction under pressure. She never faces a real temptation to do otherwise, so her success feels skilled but low-cost. The final sense of vigilance suggests endurance but doesn’t sharply reconfigure who she is.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s interiority is clear and consistent—her mix of caution, curiosity, and latent longing for connection tracks well from the rooftop encounter to the final knock on the neighbor’s door. Elias has a distinct, compelling presence, but he functions more as an archetypal guide than as a fully realized, pressure-bearing character. The final choice (going to the neighbor with sugar) is motivated by prior beats and represents a credible, if modest, change with some implied social/emotional cost. Internal conflict is present but relatively gentle; we don’t see Clara pushed into genuinely fraught contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s skepticism versus her pull toward the shell is clear and consistent, and her isolation is credibly tied to why she’s chosen. However, her shift from skeptic to believer/archivist comes very smoothly once the figure appears; there’s limited pushback or messy ambivalence in the peak beat. Emotions are mostly described rather than embodied in idiosyncratic ways. The “you’re more than you believe” reassurance feels generic and softens the edge of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and history as a forger are clear and particular, and the internal conflict between preserving pain and erasing it is well-grounded in concrete objects (the scroll, the thorn). Her shift from bitterness to forgiveness is motivated, but the process feels a bit smooth and abbreviated for how longstanding the wound is. The line “Wisely enduring, I must forgive” leans toward a tidy self-diagnosis rather than a messier, more embodied struggle. Still, her final choice forecloses a real path—continuing to live in resentment—with a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to understand why some people echo—but her interiority leans archetypal rather than idiosyncratically human. We see some embodied emotion (heart racing, hand tightening on the shell), yet little real contradiction or moral friction under pressure. The final shift from “reed-blown melancholy” to resolve comes quickly and without visible cost beyond generic effort. Her relationship with the starlit figure stays schematic, more oracle-seeker than a developed dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is clearly motivated and competent, and her role as wreck-diver ghost whisperer is distinctive, but her inner life is more labeled than dramatized (“her motivation burned brighter”) and lacks real contradiction or doubt. We see almost no struggle or friction in her process, so her emotional cost at the end is implied rather than felt. Her choices mainly confirm an existing identity instead of testing or complicating it. The result is solid but not yet deep or cutting enough for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is clearly motivated by an unusual, well-defined value system (appreciating hidden effort) and her profession dovetails nicely with her philosophy, giving her specificity. However, her inner life remains mostly harmonious rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a real test of her beliefs. The “change” at the end is more an articulation of what she already believes than a pressured shift, so the cost of her insight feels low.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive and methods are clear and consistent, and her competence comes through in concrete actions (handling the diamond, reconstructing letters, choosing to contain rather than destroy). However, her interior conflict is relatively thin—she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses beyond “curiosity vs danger,” so the final sacrifice feels more dutiful than deeply fraught. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied, keeping us a bit distant. The closing vigilance reads as earned but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s core motivation (to use the portico to shape a survivable future) is clear and consistent, and his isolation and sacrifice are sketched credibly. However, his interiority leans on summary (“His motivation was clear…”) rather than textured, scene-level contradiction. The decisive choice to activate the portico feels somewhat preordained, with only light dramatized struggle on the page. The prophet identity at the end is earned conceptually but not deeply complicated by visible flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated and particular: a “vagrant penny poet” who bottles sounds to redeem forgotten voices is distinctive and consistent on the page. His interiority is specific (grandmother’s voice in a jar, his whispered “Speak to me”) rather than generic. However, internal contradiction and real micro-costs are underdeveloped; he rarely feels genuinely torn or compromised. The final sense of wholeness comes a bit too cleanly, with little dramatized struggle beyond the music box’s initial resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive (protecting the key and preserving balance) is clear and consistent, and her “logically emotional” tension is dramatized in the confrontation and hesitation with the cloaked figure. The internal conflict between distrust and resonance with the intruder’s claim is credible, though somewhat on-the-nose. The intruder remains thinly characterized, more function than person. Her final recommitment to guardianship feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and her inner shift toward patience is coherent with her actions. However, her emotional life remains abstracted; we rarely see impatience embodied in specific impulses or mistakes, so the transformation feels low-cost. The “revolutionary” aspect of her personality is mostly told rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s role, competence, and underlying need to escape her mentor are clear, and her methodical choices (studying the fissure, opening the compartment, entering the hidden chamber) align with that. However, her interiority leans on generalized formulations (“fortified vulnerability,” “storm of thoughts”) rather than sharply particular contradictions under pressure. The mentor relationship remains entirely off-page, so the emotional cost of breaking free is asserted more than dramatized. Her final sense of freedom feels somewhat frictionless given the gravity of the implied betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by guilt, doubt, and a desire to atone, and his internal progression from hesitation to resolve is coherent. His emotional states are often summarized in familiar phrases (“relief washing over him,” “a quiet resolve forming”) rather than rendered in more idiosyncratic, embodied terms. Alistair functions more as an archetypal sage and thematic mouthpiece than as a fully individuated character under pressure. The final shift toward action is credible but its cost is gestured at rather than concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s drive is clear and consistent—she’s obsessed with the yearning algorithm and motivated by a desire to “ring a bell no one hears yet”—and her years-long tinkerer identity is credible. However, interior conflict is thin: she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or meaningful doubt, and her emotional palette stays close to determined fascination. The arrow-tip backstory hints at a deeper psychology (survival, defiance) that the present-tense action barely presses on. Her final recommitment to work lands more as affirmation than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara has a clear professional role and motivation, and her “brightly attentive” nature is at least partly dramatized in how she notices patterns. However, her interiority leans heavily on summary (“Elara’s heart raced”) rather than specific, embodied contradiction under pressure, and we rarely see real internal conflict between job loyalty and subversive investigation. The final decision to expose the truth is believable but comes a bit too cleanly, without substantial dramatized hesitation or cost. Overall, she functions well as a protagonist but lacks the depth and idiosyncrasy expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a “shadow-laced peacekeeper” who wants to mend fractures is clear and consistent, and her choices (entering the shop, moving mirror to mirror, deciding to reconstitute the ball) align with that. However, her interiority leans archetypal and abstract—she rarely feels specifically flawed or internally conflicted, and there’s no meaningful contradiction between impulses under pressure. The final merging of her “shadow-laced nature with the courage of the anomaly” works conceptually but lacks an embodied, costly struggle leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s premise as a “euthanasia tourist” seeking endings is intriguingly specific and consistent with her actions, and we get a plausible emotional throughline from disoriented arrival to modestly steadier departure. However, her inner life remains somewhat summarized and tidy, with little in-scene contradiction or real irrationality under pressure. Mara and the man are functional but thin, mostly serving as vessels for theme rather than fully felt individuals. The final “weight lift” registers, but the cost of her former obsession and the difficulty of loosening it are underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is coherent and particular—her sense of being “too practical for dreamers, too passionate for pragmatists” feels lived-in and specific. However, her shift from pain to peace comes with little on-page friction or contradictory impulse in the moment, so the internal conflict feels smoother than it should. The role of sentinel is more atmospheric refuge than a pressure-bearing function, so it doesn’t deeply complicate her choices. The final realization is emotionally plausible but a touch tidy for the depth of loss implied.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara has a clear, consistent motivation and a few specific traits (half-masked, line walker, strangely honest) that do translate into action, especially in her dutiful consecration of the parapet. However, internal contradiction and live conflict are muted—her “strangely honest” nature never really costs her anything or puts her in tension with the prophet or the world. Emotional beats are mostly summarized rather than made thorny or embodied, which flattens her arc. The sense of fulfillment at the end feels appropriate but almost too tidy and undemanding.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, backstory loss, and present task create a coherent, particular inner life, and her methodical arranging of photos feels character-specific. However, she experiences little active internal contradiction on the page—her grief and purpose align neatly without a moment where opposing impulses clash in-scene. Her emotional state is often summarized rather than deeply embodied, which mutes the sense of real strain. The closing lightness (“her heart lighter than it had been in weeks”) is believable but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his scholarly focus feels believable, but his emotional life remains relatively generalized and bloodless. We’re told he feels triumph and sorrow, yet these are not strongly embodied or complicated by contradictory impulses. His reticence and reverence for language are asserted more than dramatized through concrete, pressured choices. The final acceptance of the crystal’s cost is thematically apt but not deeply earned through prior internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation (“to capture the sound of growing older”) and a distinctive trait (precognitive forgetfulness) that gives him texture. His actions—marking with chalk, following sculpture cues, arranging driftwood—align with that goal and reveal a contemplative, ritualistic temperament. Internal conflict (fear of losing the “whisper” vs. his tendency to cling to echoes) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in sharp, contradictory impulses. The final acceptance of the sound as “enough” feels earned but could land harder with one more moment of resistance or cost earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to “harness the ephemeral”—is clear and governs her choices from studying the clock to reimagining it, and her interiority has some concrete anchors (the “luminous ache,” the pull toward the spinning hand). However, her inner life skews serene and assured; there’s little genuine contradiction or fraying under pressure. The epiphany around the leaf appears somewhat suddenly, with limited dramatized struggle leading up to it, which softens the sense of earned change. The ending stance shift (learning to move with time rather than stop it) is coherent but comes with minimal felt cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is clear, competent, and kind, but she borders on idealized, with little contradiction or strain on the page—her internal life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized. Mrs. Bennett and Claire are sketched in functional strokes (mediator, estranged daughter) without much individuating texture. Elara’s choices (creating the song, calling Claire, withdrawing with her harp) are motivated and coherent but face almost no emotional friction. The result is emotionally legible but not yet rich or messy enough for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation (mentor’s key, mystery of noon shadows) is clear and consistent, and her deliberateness shapes her methods. However, internal conflict is almost nonexistent—she never seriously doubts, fears, or wants two opposing things at once—so choices feel low-friction. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied (“Her approach was quietly deliberate,” “she felt ready”). The final stance shift (ready to face whatever comes) is thinly earned because no real path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and specific (skepticism vs yearning; guilt over the substitute body) and her final choice to relinquish the certainty-stone is earned. Interiority is reasonably embodied (“boots crunching,” “heart pounding”) and consistent. However, her flaws are somewhat idealized—her “forgiving skeptic” nature produces little genuine misstep or blindness on the page. The internal conflict remains smooth rather than sharply torn, which slightly softens the impact of the climactic renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and specific—her vow against fire and devotion to gentle light—and her history with her mother and the accident grounds that drive. Interiority is textured but largely harmonious; she rarely feels genuinely pulled between conflicting impulses, which flattens potential tension. Her emotional state moves from focused to peaceful in a plausible way but with limited visible cost or messy contradiction. The final readiness to share the sea glass feels earned but almost entirely aligned with her long-held values rather than wrestled for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner world are clear and specific—her history with the viral confession, her curatorial care of the space, and the amber pendant all ground her. Her guardedness versus desire for connection is present but could be sharpened into a more acute internal conflict at the moment she lets Kai in. Kai is gentle and somewhat idealized but functions well as a relational mirror rather than a full antagonist. The final shift—from refuge as solitary to shared—feels earned, though the cost of that openness is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to “collect the shapes of different hopes” and her conflict between self-protection and bearing others’ pain are clear and consistent, and the mother’s story in particular lands with some emotional specificity. Her internal contradictions (fear vs. duty) are dramatized rather than merely labeled. However, her interiority leans toward generalized abstractions about “hope” and “stories” rather than idiosyncratic perceptions or flaws, which keeps her from feeling fully singular. The final shift into purposeful authorship is earned but comes with limited felt personal cost beyond solemn resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation (restore sacred practices to heal her village) is clear and consistent, and her actions—studying the tendril, choosing to sing—align with it. However, she remains largely idealized and conflict-free, with little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine flaw. Emotional texture is mostly summarized hope and determination rather than embodied, idiosyncratic feeling. The closing sense of “purpose found” is earned but costs her nothing visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) is clear and consistent, and her patience is well embodied in her deliberate gestures. However, she encounters little genuine pressure; there’s minimal sense of internal contradiction or competing impulses. Her emotional range is narrow—serene, focused, quietly triumphant—so we don’t see flaw or real vulnerability. The final “change” is more in the environment than in her, which limits the felt cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and the craft focus (his hands, attention to overlooked details) gives him some specificity. However, his interior conflict is minimal: he wants something, works toward it, and gets it without serious internal contradiction or fraught choice. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied under pressure. The closing sense of peace feels earned but low-cost, closer to fulfillment than a charged renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and identity as a “fractal weaver” are clear and consistent, and the tension between her declared purpose and the figure’s challenge gives her a credible internal conflict. Her embodied responses (gripping the lamp, feeling a “crack form within her”) ground the emotion. However, her decision to “begin with myself” comes a bit quickly and with limited messy ambivalence on the page, softening the sense of cost. The visiting figure functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully pressuring character, which slightly flattens relational dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief and motivation to “harvest lessons from loss” are clear and consistent, and her choice to carve the lion is well rooted in her relationship with Marius. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal, especially in the lion-taming/grief analogy. However, her inner life trends more toward articulated reflection than lived contradiction—there’s little sense of simultaneous, messy impulses under pressure. The final resilience feels earned but slightly tidy for the complexity of the loss implied.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to negotiate with her own ghost / eroded ambitions) is clear and coherently drives her actions, and her interiority is specific enough to feel individual. The scavenging method and her sensitivity to objects/whispers reveal character under pressure. However, emotions lean on somewhat generic formulations of regret (“Regret clung to her like a second skin”) and the final reframing of her ghost edges toward tidy epiphany. The internal conflict between paralysis and renewed agency is present but could be sharpened into more contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eli’s core traits—curiosity, engineer’s eye, desire for “equations for hope”—are clear and consistent, and his actions match them. However, his interiority leans on summarized motives and abstract phrasing rather than concrete, character-specific contradictions under pressure. We don’t see him wrestle with competing impulses or costs; he simply follows through on a single, unopposed drive. The final shift toward “a new equation for hope” feels thematically tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is clear and consistent—introverted, dutiful, quietly yearning—and her choice to finish her father’s clock is well motivated by the accumulated pressure of the whispers and memory. However, her internal conflict remains relatively smooth; we’re told of a buried desire to travel, but we don’t see that desire actively pulling against her in embodied, contradictory impulses at key beats. The change to “carry” the dream rather than abandon it feels emotionally plausible, but its cost is only lightly sketched rather than deeply felt. Overall, the characterization is strong but not yet piercing enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s overarching motivation—to uncover the “architecture of lies”—is clear and consistent, and her errant, truth-seeking nature comes through. However, her interior life remains generalized; we’re told what drives her more than we feel it through contradictory impulses or specific memories. Her emotional response to the captain’s confession (“Elara’s heart ached…”) is earnest but broad, without a sharp, character-particular angle. The final stance shift (standing tall with sundial and journal) reads more like a restated mission than a costly new commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve ancient methods and decode the knots—is clear, consistent, and nicely tied to her profession as a seed collector. Interiority is present but largely single-note: patient, reverent, purposeful, with little contradictory impulse or real doubt. Her “change” at the end is more confirmation of what she already believes than a pressured evolution. The absence of any visible cost or moral friction keeps the characterization from feeling fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The traveler is specific, consistent, and tactically gentle; her choices (approaching, listening, deciding what to write, accepting the thread) are all motivated by her vocation. The elderly woman’s fixation on the ship is simple but credible and provides a clear emotional focus. What’s missing is active internal contradiction or visible strain in the traveler—she performs her role almost too smoothly, with little friction or self-doubt. The final “change” is largely externalized (the woman’s release) rather than a fully earned internal pivot for the traveler herself.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his isolation plus idealism give him a legible core. However, his interiority leans abstract (“hope mixed with dread”) rather than sharply embodied, and contradictory impulses (revulsion at machines vs. willingness to assemble one) are asserted more than deeply dramatized. The final realization about beauty being nurtured, not forced, is thematically apt but arrives as a tidy insight rather than a hard-won, messy internal turn. Overall he feels coherent but not yet fully particular or complex enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation and contradiction—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter seeking transformation rather than atonement—are clear, specific, and embodied in her ritual at the lagoon. Her emotional state is mostly shown through tactile engagement with sand, seeds, and coin rather than abstract labels. However, internal conflict stays relatively smooth; there’s little on-page pushback or irrationality under pressure, and her final stance arrives without a truly hard internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core traits—“luminous skeptic,” “realistically imaginative,” obsessive yet cautious—are clear and consistently expressed through her choices to pursue the box despite doubt. The internal arc from skeptic to “liberator” is legible, with the syncing glow of the box as a nice externalization of her wavering belief. However, her inner conflict remains relatively low-friction: she never seriously considers refusing the quest, and her emotional life is more described than dramatized in embodied, scene-level beats. The final transformation lands, but without a sharply felt cost or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (“to share light without using fire”) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is present, but largely in generalized, abstract terms. We see only limited contradictory impulses or real struggle; her epiphany arrives with minimal resistance. Emotion is more labeled than embodied, so she reads as a symbolic figure more than a fully individuated person. The final “change” feels like a smooth realization rather than a hard-won, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her profession, family history, and bond with Tomas all shape how she approaches the stone and the ribbon. Her core motivation (finding the “shape” of grief) is clear and her final stance feels earned via the butterflies/ribbon insight. Internal contradiction is mild but present: she’s both blocked and deeply skilled, both anchored by Tomas and needing to let him go. The main limitation is that her struggle proceeds smoothly; we don’t see her make a truly fraught or costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly drawn—precise, dutiful, shaped by his father’s disappointment—and his shift from mere winder to “keeper of time” feels internally consistent. However, his inner life leans toward abstraction and summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; we’re told he is ethically diligent and burdened, but rarely see him struggle in a specific, fraught choice. The epiphany around the inscriptions and his new role arrives smoothly, with little friction or self-doubt on the page. Strong core, but not yet the textured, pressure-tested interiority expected at a top literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias’s curiosity and tenderness are clearly motivated and consistent, and his vocation and habits feel particular. However, he encounters almost no real resistance, has little internal contradiction, and the “change” at the end is more affirmation than transformation. The lack of visible cost or conflicted impulse keeps the characterization from deeper complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ignorance has a clear role and motive, and the detail of his trembling from “the weight of possibility” gives him some dimensionality, but he largely functions as an emblematic figure rather than a deeply individuated person. Internal conflict is minimal—he’s doubtful but not truly torn—and his shift from hesitation to confidence comes very smoothly, without much visible cost. The “cartographer of dreams” concept gives him texture but isn’t dramatized in his behavior beyond a few lines about predictive models. Overall, he’s serviceable but not yet compelling at a literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s core motivation (“to teach dust to tell stories”) is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized in her choices to work late, tune the radio, and frantically transcribe. However, she experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; she moves smoothly from curiosity to resolve. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied, which keeps her from feeling fully particular. The final stance—her renewed determination—is credible but arrives without much felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motive—to honor the dead man and crystallize a fleeting emotion—is clear and consistent, and her interiority around broken-but-beautiful things feels specific. However, there’s very little genuine internal contradiction or pressure; once she enters the gallery, her path to completing the ritual is essentially uncontested. Emotional states are more labeled than embodied at key beats (“weight of her task pressed heavily on her heart” versus a more idiosyncratic reaction). The final sense of closure is earned but relatively low-cost and uncomplex.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motives (preserving knowledge, clinging to relics) and temperament (“abrasive calm,” stubborn rationalism) are clear and mostly consistent, and his slow opening to Lira tracks plausibly. However, interior conflict is often summarized in abstract terms (“agonized over the competing narratives”) rather than dramatized in concrete, in-the-moment choices. Lira has hints of specificity (defiant scavenger) but remains more a thematic foil than a fully embodied person. The final acceptance that both narratives can coexist feels plausible but slightly under-earned emotionally because we don’t see a sharp, costly internal struggle at the decision point to leave the sewer.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve harmony and vanishing arts—is clear and consistent, and her actions (gathering students, changing rehearsal method) align with it. However, interiority is generalized and thematic rather than character-particular, with little contradictory impulse or genuine moral dilemma on the page. The students remain faceless, and their relationship to Elara under pressure isn’t dramatized beyond trust and awe. The closing realization feels more like a calm confirmation than a hard-won change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (to “create something beautiful from the ruins”) is clear and consistent, and her connection to her grandmother gives her a specific moral framework (“pruning” as shaping what remains). We get some embodied interiority (doubt, quiet determination) but little real contradiction or messy ambivalence under pressure. Her doubts about whether the fruit will work appear briefly and resolve without forcing a costly choice. The final stance (embracing the rebellion and sharing the fruit) feels earned but low-stress rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara has a clear core—candid, duty-bound, motivated by preserving wonder—but her involuntary truthfulness and social isolation are mostly told rather than stressed in scene. Her decisions (descending, touching the orb, choosing to reveal) align logically with that setup. Internal conflict is thin: she never seriously considers not following the pull of the box or not revealing what she learns. The change at the end (accepting her role as truth-teller) feels earned but comes without much visible cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and perceptual bias are clear and consistent, and the choice to gather and “sanctify” the objects credibly arises from who he is. However, he experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradiction; he remains serenely insightful throughout. The shift at the end—accepting a “calling”—feels organic but comes without much visible cost or resistance. He is distinct, but slightly idealized and under-pressured for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora’s motivation and nature are clear and appealing, and the telepathic access to Elara’s thoughts gives some specificity, but internal conflict is muted and largely summarized. Elara’s desperation for her village remains abstract; we’re told about it more than we feel it in embodied detail. The key turn—Liora warning her about the ampoule’s fragility—makes sense but doesn’t force a deeply conflicted choice so much as a prudent adjustment. The final “finding purpose” for Liora feels a bit declared rather than wrestled toward on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motives (to recapture a missed moment, to honor/escape her mentor’s legacy) are clear and consistently dramatized, and her internal shift from grasping to letting go is credibly earned by the loss of the chipped die. Her interiority is concrete and particular (“grim optimist,” “balancedly daring”) and shows in her cautious but persistent movement through a hostile geometry. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays conceptually neat—wanting to hold on vs. needing to release—without much messy irrationality or self-sabotage under pressure. Relationships (mentor, friend) are powerful but off-page, so they can’t fully act as crucibles in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s insomnia, persistence, and need for purpose are clear and consistent, and her nightly ritual in the greenhouse feels character-specific. The motivation to “prove that strangers remember kindness” adds a distinctive angle but is more told than dramatized. Internal contradiction is relatively mild—she slides into the brush’s pull with little resistance—so the final sense of purpose, while earned, carries limited visible cost. The characterization is strong but not yet cutting enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, values, and motivation are clear and consistent, and her choice to use the lens and honey through the bread ritual is coherent with her characterization. However, her interiority skews declarative and tidy (“rosewater dread,” her articulated mission) rather than complicating itself with live contradictions in the moment. She never pays a visible cost or makes a genuinely fraught trade-off; everything works on the first attempt. The community is treated as an undifferentiated mass, so no relational crucible sharpens her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (rebellion against linear time, desire to rewrite his fate) is clear and coherently tied to his profession and actions. His interiority is specific enough to feel like a particular mind, especially in his methodical, engineer-like approach. However, internal conflict is thin: the late unease doesn’t quite rise to a genuine contradiction that shapes choices, since he never seriously hesitates. The ending suggests cost but doesn’t fully dramatize a micro-choice where competing impulses collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s core fear—being forgotten—is clear and ties cleanly to her actions, and her shift from paralysis to active confrontation reads motivated by the funhouse journey and the clasp’s revelations. However, her interiority often stays at a conceptual level (“the fear of being forgotten, of fading into nothingness”) rather than embodied, and the final transformation comes a bit too cleanly, with limited sense of contradictory impulses at the peak. The advisor has some texture (repulsive yet compelling) but remains mostly a functional mouthpiece rather than a fully pressured presence. The emotional cost of the change is asserted more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward is clearly motivated by resolving inner and ambient “restlessness” through harmony, with a consistent worldview built around “sketched resonance” and his mallet. Embodiment (bare, calloused feet; careful movement) grounds him, but his internal life stays relatively simple: there’s little contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. The shift from unease to peace is clear but emotionally low-cost and largely unopposed. This is strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the depth or complexity expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in a specific past (her mentor and the lost expedition), and her competence with pattern language makes her feel capable rather than generic. However, she experiences very little on-page internal conflict; once she commits, she mostly moves forward without contradictory impulses or visible doubt, which flattens her emotional complexity. Embodied emotion is present but somewhat conventional (“heart pounding,” “air thickened with dread”). The final shift into a larger mission is credible but could carry more visible personal cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her methodical, analytical nature comes through in how she moves through the station. However, internal conflict is largely summarized (e.g., “a trait that had both saved and isolated her”) rather than dramatized under pressure. Her success feels relatively unchallenged, so we see less of her contradictions or limits. The resulting arc is credible but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—professional duty inflected with a quiet reverence for lost stories—and his micro-choices (wading in, preserving the journal, writing the note) align with that. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely hesitates or struggles, so his shift from surveyor to “keeper of what had been lost” feels like a gentle naming of what he already is rather than a hard-won change. Emotions are mostly conveyed through elevated abstraction rather than messier, character-particular conflict. The result is solid but short of the psychologically complex interiority expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (“to trace honest origins”) is clear and consistent, and her logical, observant nature comes through. However, her internal conflict stays mostly summarized (“dappled resolve… even as doubts lingered”) rather than dramatized through hard, value-costly choices. Her emotional life is more labeled than embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses truly collide on the page. The final sense of “profound purpose” is earned conceptually but not deeply fought for in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s grief, craft-identity, and avoidance strategies are specific and coherent, and his final shift from control to acknowledgment feels causally earned. The origami cranes and detached shadow externalize his internal state in a character-particular way. The internal conflict (need to feel vs. compulsion to transform) is present, though not pushed into truly messy contradiction. A few emotional statements (“luminous torment,” “consumed by it”) lean toward abstraction rather than fully embodied nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    Zara’s motivation and history are clear, and the geode-focused epiphany aligns with her need to reconstitute a self after trauma. However, her emotional life is rendered mostly in conceptual terms (“unused potential,” “spark of unfiltered awakening”) rather than embodied, moment-to-moment conflict. We rarely see contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves fairly smoothly from devastation to purpose. The final shift into “seeker, hunter of light” feels a bit ideationally neat given the depth of her loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motivation (find the chip to decode belonging) is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his competence with the drone is well established. However, his interiority is thin and often rendered in generic shorthand (“his heart raced,” “his mind racing”) rather than character-specific perception. The “perpetually surprised expression” reads more like a prompt artifact than a psychologically grounded trait. The final realization that the missing pieces are also “fragments of himself” feels lightly earned because we haven’t seen much prior internal conflict or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt, profession, and small acts (stealing the watch, choosing the shore, aligning the hand with the carving) create a coherent, specific psyche. His internal conflict—profiting from lies vs. need for moral self-preservation—is clear and embodied rather than abstract. The final resolution (“perhaps he could stop adding to the lies”) is credible Earned Stasis but slightly neat and lightly dramatized. A touch more live contradiction at the peak (temptation to double down vs. confess) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and particular—her reliance on empathy, the drawer pull, and moon phases gives her a distinct, believable psychology under pressure. Kael is somewhat thinner but still legible: proud, wounded, cautious, yet capable of movement. The shift from his resistance (“neutrality is a luxury we cannot afford”) to cautious agreement is motivated and earned. Internal contradiction is present but gentle rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and coherent—the failed compass, reliance on utility poles, and desire to “align her heart and her actions” create a believable, wounded competence. The “broken navigator” identity is nicely dramatized through tools and habits, not just labels. The arc from paralysis to a fragile, forward motion feels earned, though the emotional vocabulary occasionally leans abstract (“backlash of regrets”) instead of fully embodied contradiction. The internal conflict remains low-key, but her small choice to paddle on without the compass reads as a credible, costly endurance rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (a clean slate to recover empathy) is clear and consistently tied to the procedure and his fragmentary guilt. His internal conflict—wanting erasure yet still haunted—comes through, though it sometimes leans on generalized formulations rather than sharply idiosyncratic perception. The decision to enter the lake and the final reframing of his purpose feel earned by prior interiority. A bit more embodied contradiction under peak moments (panic over the ball, surfacing) would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her emotional arc from fixation on a lost bond to inward reconnection tracks causally. However, her inner conflict is smoothed over—she accepts the guardian’s challenge with little resistance, and her “reluctant metamorphosis” never feels genuinely at odds with her desire. The guardian remains archetypal, applying mild pressure but with little complexity or distinct personality. The final shift reads earned enough for this length, but the cost of letting go of the past is asserted more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—seeking “where lost time accumulates” to atone for missed familial moments—and her actions (coming to the glade, using the saucer, choosing to return) all stem from that. The emotional core around the nephew and family ritual feels specific rather than generic. Internal conflict (duty vs presence, regret vs hope) is present but remains relatively tidy and low in messiness. The final shift to “not with apologies, but with presence” is earned, if slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her pacifism is plausibly tied to the mission and relic, but her internal life leans on abstractions (“shadow work,” “fractures in her soul”) more than concrete, character-specific contradictions. We rarely see her genuinely torn or tempted; her resolve never wavers in a way that forces a costly choice. The change by the end—lighter spirit, deeper understanding—feels thematically apt but emotionally under-dramatized. The result is a coherent but somewhat schematic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and history as a destitute philanthropist are clear and coherent, and her final act of releasing the bottle aligns with her stated desire to understand transformation. However, her interiority leans toward abstract reflection rather than sharply individuated, embodied emotion, which mutes specificity. There’s little genuine internal contradiction or resistance—she mostly drifts toward a destiny rather than wrestling with it. The resulting change feels credible but emotionally low-friction for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to awaken the oppressed without bloodshed) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a sentinel and cipher-breaker tracks well with her actions. We get enough interiority to understand her choices, but little true internal contradiction or felt doubt under pressure. Thorne functions more as a symbolic obstacle than a fully realized character, though his brief hesitation adds a useful hint of complexity. The closing stance—Elara committed to a “silent revolution”—feels earned but carries minimal on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s core motivation—to decode sacred patterns—is clear and consistently embodied in his actions, and his years-long obsession (“edge of sanity and back”) gives him specificity beyond a stock mystic. However, his internal conflict in the climactic moment is underdeveloped: we’re told he fears and desires this moment, but we don’t feel competing impulses in real time. The epiphany lands, but it comes a bit smoothly, with limited sense of risk that he might reject or misread what he finds. Still, his choices are coherent and his final stance—a calm, charged continuation of the quest—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding and confronting the “cartography of scars”—is clear, specific, and meaningfully tied to their history and vocation. Interiority is textured and mostly embodied (timer, trembling hands, storm), though some shifts (“They were a cartographer of scars, a keeper of truths”) lean toward label rather than dramatized contradiction. The move from chronic self-censorship to sudden commitment to uncensored writing is emotionally plausible but arrives with limited on-page resistance or visible cost. Internal conflict (fear vs. clarity) is present but could be sharpened with one concrete, costly memory or hesitation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias has a clear, particular motivation and a distinct professional identity, and Mara functions as a credible intellectual foil. However, both remain largely at the level of articulated positions rather than embodied people; emotional stakes and contradictions are underdrawn. Elias’s “revelation” at the end reads more like a stated thesis than a hard-won internal turn with cost. The mechanical arm hints at complexity but never meaningfully interacts with his psychology or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is vivid and particular—a “vagrant penny poet” with the molting-selves habit and a clear drive to make beauty from rubble—while Clara is sketched more lightly but still distinct and grounded by the coffee tin and prison work. His emotional shift from perpetual molting to feeling this self might be “here to stay” is legible and motivated. However, internal contradiction is mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told about his past instability more than we see it under pressure. The relationship deepens credibly, but it never truly becomes a crucible that forces a painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief, weariness, and flicker of renewed will are clear, with the clock, piano, and film reel all revealing facets of her. However, her internal conflict (resignation vs. defiance of fate) stays somewhat tidy and rational, with limited messy or contradictory impulses in-scene. Emotional response leans on familiar formulations (“refuge from the silence”) rather than deeply idiosyncratic embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and her actions align with her stated goal of safeguarding cultural memory. However, her interiority remains relatively generic and unconflicted; “luminous doubt” is named but never forces a hard, value-testing choice. The riddle with the guardian resolves too smoothly to expose flaws, blind spots, or real hesitation. As a result, her change feels more like confirmation of an existing stance than an earned evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and memorable—a slow-spoken bonsai tutor whose patience and regret feel organically tied to his vocation and behavior. His motivation (seeking the “color of unspoken apologies”) is clear and carries through to the end. The shift from clinging to regret to leaving the compass and lace behind is credible, though his internal conflict could be rendered with a bit more friction or self-contradiction in the middle. Emotional states are mostly embodied and concrete, with only occasional drift toward summary.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on abstract, stated motivations ("strip away the needless drama") rather than dramatized struggle. Elara functions as a passive observer of magical events; her background as a researcher provides metaphorical flavor but does not drive distinct, expert tactics or decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("steadily adaptive") and summary ("motivation was clear") rather than dramatized behavior. Emotional reactions are standard and lack specific interiority; the protagonist functions as a vehicle for plot tokens rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.7)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("Elara’s motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through struggle. The protagonist lacks agency in the climax; a secondary character delivers the solution, rendering Elara a passive recipient of the epiphany. The "capsize survivor" trait is applied metaphorically in a way that feels like a workaround for a prompt constraint rather than a genuine character history.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("give rest a permanent address") is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through difficult choices. He functions as a vehicle for the fetch-quest plot, facing no internal conflict or genuine cost; his "stubbornness" is a declared trait that does not complicate the action. The emotional resolution ("weariness lifting") feels unearned, as it follows a linear path of success without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mara serves more as a vehicle for the theme than a fleshed-out character; her motivation is explicitly told ("Mara’s motivation was clear") rather than revealed through difficult choices. She faces no internal contradictions or genuine flaws, and her "peace" at the end feels unearned because she encounters no significant resistance or cost. The lack of a crucible moment flattens her arc into a simple success story.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara lacks agency and interiority; her actions are dictated by external "pulls" and magical prompts rather than character decisions. Key traits like her "spiritually curious nature" are delivered via label-speak rather than dramatized through difficult choices or behavior. The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the plot's linear progression.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist lacks contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict; her obsession is stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. The ending's "discovery of self" reads as an unearned summary rather than a transformation born of struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a person, defined by melodramatic descriptors ("eyes burned with a purpose") rather than specific, embodied interiority. The resolution of their physical constraint—chains magically falling away—undercuts the physical reality of the character, treating them as a metaphor rather than a human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara is a functional vessel for the concept but lacks internal contradiction or resistance. Her motivation is stated ("consumed her for years") rather than dramatized through struggle or trade-offs in the scene; she executes her task without hesitation or character-specific obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on abstract assertions ("quietly savvy," "grace of someone who belonged to the shadows") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine blind spots; her interaction with the antagonist is frictionless, requiring no difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("afraid of vulnerability") and therapeutic summary rather than embodied behavior. The motivation ("craft safe zones for inquiry") reads as abstract intent rather than a dramatized desire under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("phobia-ridden," "firmly adaptive") rather than dramatized behavior; the stunt double background does not inform her tactical choices or physical interaction with the space. Internal conflict is summarized ("phobias warring with her determination") rather than shown through specific physiological resistance or hesitation. The realization of "vulnerability is power" is stated as an abstract thesis rather than earned through a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the prompt’s "mildly obsessed" label, which is stated rather than dramatized through struggle or cost. Emotional states are described via abstract summaries ("quiet intensity," "quiet joy") rather than embodied reaction, and the character faces no difficult choices that reveal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("driven by a singular motivation") rather than dramatized through struggle or resistance. The character's transformation into a "seeker" relies on abstract labels ("surge of understanding," "newfound clarity") rather than embodied emotion or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Motivation is stated via diagnostic labeling ("Elara’s motivation tonight was clear") rather than dramatized through friction. The emotional arc is summarized; Kian’s immediate, smiling acceptance bypasses the necessary struggle or cost of reconciliation. The characters lack distinct interiority, functioning as vessels for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his actions (polishing, placing marbles) face no resistance or cost. The characterization relies on stock phrases ("gnarled hands," "wisely pragmatic") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The emotional arc is linear and resolved too easily, missing the psychological depth required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira functions as an archetype rather than a specific individual; her interiority relies on high-level summaries ("paradox she had embraced") rather than embodied reaction.

The character remains distant, defined by her role rather than her specific human friction with the task.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.4)
    Kael is a passive observer who succeeds without struggle or distinct personality traits beyond the prompt's labels. His motivation is stated abstractly ("wanted to understand") rather than felt through consequence or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on labeled emotions ("unease," "grim determination") and stock traits rather than embodied reaction or specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by explicit labels ("affectionate skeptic") that contradict her on-page behavior, as she relies entirely on "unseen" intuition and "somatic markers" without a single moment of skeptical inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and diagnostic labels ("insulating himself... with facts") rather than demonstrated behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s internal struggle is clear, but her agency is weak; she relies on a coincidental encounter to unlock her epiphany rather than earning it through active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is defined entirely by the label "intrepid" and follows external prompts without hesitation or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on label-only motivation ("cultivate foresight in action") pasted from the prompt rather than dramatized desire.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara’s motivation is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told her mission is personal ("vowed to prove them wrong"), but the internal stakes remain abstract. The mention of "unfettering her own fears" appears only as setup without a demonstrated struggle or cost in the moment of action. The character functions more as a vehicle for the ritual than a person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a grounded character; motivation is stated ("yearning to bridge gaps") rather than shown through costly choices. Interiority relies on summary labels ("joys and sorrows interwoven") and diagnostic therapy-speak instead of embodied emotion, and the resolution comes too easily without exposing genuine flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is a functional protagonist who fulfills the "jittery courier" brief, but her role is largely passive. The climax relies on the relic choosing her rather than her making a difficult, character-defining choice; her hesitation is brief, and the resolution is granted by the scholar rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the plot; she is pulled, redirected, and handed the solution (the blue shard) without struggle. Motivation is stated via exposition ("Her motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.0)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjectives ("reticent," "warmly observant") rather than dramatized behavior.

    The protagonist acts as a passive vehicle for the theme rather than a living character with conflicting desires.

There is no struggle or cost to his actions; he functions as a flawless guru figure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated via exposition ("to discover what trees witness") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or urgent needs. Elias functions as a passive observer to a magical process, engaging in no difficult choices or meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.6)
    Lila acts as a vehicle for plot tropes rather than a breathing character; her motivation ("capture the sound of trust breaking") is abstract poeticism that never grounds in concrete desire.

The attribute "curiously steadfast" appears as a direct label rather than a demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is labeled a "skeptic" but accepts supernatural explanations and a "chosen one" destiny without resistance or scrutiny, creating a fatal contradiction between stated traits and on-page action.

The character functions as a passive receptacle for exposition rather than an agent of change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.2)
    Character motivation is declared through abstraction ("motivation to uncork... burned brighter") rather than dramatized through struggle. The "mnemonically gifted" trait appears as a label to justify a metaphor ("memories felt like chains") but never constrains a specific tactic or forces a difficult trade-off. The emotional arc is linear and lacks the oscillation of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara reads as an archetype rather than a specific individual; her internal life is defined entirely by her magical utility and backstory summary. The narrative relies on expository telling ("Her art wilted near dishonesty... This had made her both revered and isolated") rather than dramatizing these conflicts in scene. There is no contradictory impulse or moment of hesitation that tests her character; she simply executes the plot's requirements without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.8)
    Elara functions as an archetype rather than a character; she faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult choices.

    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("nostalgic android," "fragmented wholeness") rather than embodied emotion or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies entirely on external labeling ("Eli's motivation was deeply personal") rather than dramatized struggle or interior contradiction. The protagonist lacks agency beyond performing a procedural ritual; his "desperation" is stated but not embodied in high-stakes choices or physical behavior. The resolution offers a "smiling" lack of complexity, ignoring the potential psychological cost of the memory loss established in the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted individual; her interiority consists of abstract spiritual summaries ("letting the tranquility... wash over her") rather than specific, contradictory impulses. The emotional progression is linear and lacks the required on-page friction or flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.2)
    Clara is a passive vessel for the antagonist’s exposition rather than an active agent; she accepts the stranger's worldview without genuine resistance or internal conflict.

Motivation is external ("drawn... by whispers"), and the internal arc is resolved via a lecture from a magical figure rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.1)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is summarized through emotive clichés ("chain breaking within her soul") rather than dramatized choice. The moment of decision relies on a spoken affirmation that feels performative rather than an organic culmination of character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a magical plot device rather than a character with agency or cost. She faces no internal contradiction, requires no specific expertise beyond "focusing," and pays no emotional price for the ritual. The motivation is stated ("salvage something pure") but never tested against a counter-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("net-mender philosopher," "audacity") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara lacks contradictory impulses or internal struggle; her "journey" is a static procession of agreeable thoughts without a defining choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's transition from a skeptic who "wasn't one to believe in curses" to a magic-user chanting to seal a breach is abrupt and unearned. Her primary trait, "sharply observant," serves as a repetitive label rather than a driver of unique perception or distinct choices. The internal landscape is flattened by this contradiction; she accepts the supernatural without the cognitive struggle expected of a debunker.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on stock labels ("visionary," "prophet") rather than behavior. Elias lacks internal conflict; he obeys the voice without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.7)

    Characterization relies entirely on abstract labels ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness") rather than dramatized behavior.

There is no struggle or cost to her transformation; she simply decides to change, resulting in a flat, fable-like protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is defined almost exclusively by diagnostic labels ("watchful calm," "fortified vulnerability") rather than dramatized behavior.

    Lira is a passive collection of prompt tags rather than a character under pressure; her occupation as a "cart glider" is irrelevant to the action, creating cognitive dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is abstract ("witness... endings") and resolved via unearned epiphany. Interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("gripping reality loosely") rather than embodied struggle, and the final interaction ("knowing smile") feels like a stock gesture without authentic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("sentinel," "nurturer") rather than dramatized behavior.

There are no contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices; the protagonist moves from confusion to clarity via summary rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined by repeated labels ("strangely honest") rather than behavior under pressure. She faces no difficult choices and lacks internal conflict; her actions are rote compliance with a duty that costs her nothing.

The result is a static figure who experiences no genuine agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elias functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure; his motivation is abstract ("capture the sound of growing older") and lacks visceral, immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is defined by diagnostic labels ("conflicted," "lucidly watchful") rather than dramatized behavior. Her internal struggle is summarized ("part of her wanted to turn away") rather than shown through a difficult on-page choice that carries cost.

The narrative relies on romanticized descriptions of his intuition rather than dramatizing a struggle that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.7)

    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("harvest lessons," "resilience," "peace") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses.

The emotional arc relies on diagnostic self-awareness rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.9)
    The protagonist is a collection of genre tropes defined by abstract labels ("errant legend seeker," "architecture of lies") rather than specific, grounded behavior. She possesses convenient "instincts" that remove all need for struggle or deduction, navigating the scene with an unearned competence that alienates the reader. There is no internal conflict or palpable emotion; her heart "aches" on cue, but the feeling is unmoored from any established relationship or loss. Ultimately, she functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on assertive labeling ("infinitely patient," "philosophical seed collector") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara faces no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; she deciphers the code because the plot demands it, not through a specific, flawed human process. The lack of a difficult choice or cost leaves her feeling like a generic vessel for the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist functions as a narrative device rather than a character with internal conflict or risk; her "satchel was light" mirrors the lack of personal stakes.

The secondary character is a stock figure of grief who offers no resistance, making the protagonist's journey purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael’s motivation is stated clearly, but his interiority relies on labeled emotions ("heart sank," "surge of hope") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("heart hardened," "unyielding compassion") and backstory summary rather than dramatized traits in the present. The internal state is described through abstract metaphors rather than embodied emotion or specific, difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than behavior; her "skepticism" dissolves instantly upon finding a magical object.

The "younger self" reflection is a generic emotional proxy that avoids specific, embodied character work.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)

Elias lacks internal conflict or a distinct psychology, reacting to the "mystery" with automatic competence rather than human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the plot; agency is outsourced to the "quill [that] had a mind of its own." The name "Ignorance Cartographer" reads as an awkward placeholder or literalized prompt tag that disrupts immersion. Internal conflict is stated ("trembled... not from fear") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    Clara is defined by labels ("diligent," "meticulous") rather than choices under pressure. Her motivation is stated explicitly ("to teach dust to tell stories") rather than emerging from a struggle, and she faces no internal conflict; she simply accepts the broadcast with "excitement" rather than the fear or risk a "pirate" signal implies.

    Elara lacks genuine internal conflict; her "doubts" are resolved instantly without struggle or trade-offs. She functions as a flawless vehicle for the theme rather than a character under pressure, and her motivation is abstract ("spark a gentle rebellion") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist's core trait ("involuntarily truthful") exists only as a label; because she is alone, this constraint never forces a difficult choice or creates friction. Motivation is explicitly stated ("to preserve wonder") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound") rather than dramatized behavior or internal contradiction.

    Elara serves as a passive vessel for the magical brush rather than an active protagonist; her primary motivation ("prove strangers remember kindness") is stated in exposition but does not drive her tactical choices. Her interiority relies on stock physical reactions ("breath catching," "heart racing") rather than specific, embodied emotion or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara is defined by explicit labels ("cultured museum guide," "historically oriented") rather than dramatized traits or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("His motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through conflict or backstory pressure. Elias executes a pre-formed plan without internal struggle or micro-choices, rendering him a functional archetype rather than a living character. The "neatly inventive mind" serves as a label rather than a demonstrated trait tested by failure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.2)
    Clara is defined by abstract labels rather than embodied traits; her "fear of being forgotten" is announced rather than dramatized through specific behavior. The resolution relies on a sudden, unearned epiphany without psychological resistance or internal contradiction, resulting in a mechanical character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is asserted via exposition ("His motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through difficult choice or sacrifice. The protagonist faces no internal contradiction or meaningful struggle; he acts as a competent functionary who solves the abstract problem instantly without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is summarized in backstory ("obsession began years ago") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page impulses or difficult micro-choices. Interiority relies on stock physical markers ("heart pounding," "mind raced") and lacks a distinct psychological texture. The protagonist faces no internal resistance or contradictory values, making her a generic vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("emotionally rational") rather than demonstrated traits through choice. The protagonist undergoes a profound emotional shift ("truth was not always black and white") without an on-page struggle or catalytic event to earn it. The epiphany feels performed and convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on oxymoronic labels ("stoically sensitive") and abstract internal summary rather than demonstrated traits. Elias faces no genuine internal conflict or difficult choice; his shift from surveyor to "archeologist of dreams" is an unearned slide driven by the prompt rather than character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on inserting prompt labels ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than dramatizing traits through friction. Elara exhibits no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her motivation is stated as a thesis ("trace honest origins") rather than felt as a drive. She moves through the plot with perfect emotional calibration, lacking the flaws or blind spots required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal shift relies on abstract metaphors ("shadow detached") and resolves instantly upon a realization, lacking the struggle or behavioral contradictions of genuine grief. The epiphany feels unearned, as the transition from despair to acceptance happens without a visible cost or difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.5)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("Her motivation was clear") rather than dramatized through action or conflicting desires. The protagonist lacks agency, serving merely as a vessel for internal monologue without making a pressure-driven choice on the page. Emotions are labeled ("joy and love," "nightmare," "despair") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or distinct traits beyond the repeated label "perpetually surprised." Emotional shifts are summarized ("tinged with determination," "quiet resolve") rather than embodied, and he faces no difficult choices that reveal character, merely performing logistical tasks with instant competence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through heavy-handed summary ("guilt gnawing at him") rather than dramatized action or specific detail. The "memory surfaced" beat is contradictory; he is said to have "buried" the truth, yet the opening paragraph establishes he is already fully aware of it, making the realization redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on direct telling (e.g., "her uncommonly thoughtful nature") rather than demonstrated behavior. Elara acts as a thematic mouthpiece without internal conflict, and Kael’s sudden capitulation reduces him to a narrative prop rather than a resisting agent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("broken navigator," "fractured heart") and summarized backstory rather than dramatized behavior. Motivation is explicitly stated by the narrator ("Her motivation was clear: to align her heart...") rather than revealed through conflicting choices. The emotional arc feels unearned, transitioning from despair to hope via internal monologue without external pressure testing the character's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elias is defined by labels ("clean slate seeker," "ambition") rather than dramatized behavior. His primary action (dropping the ball) is accidental, undermining agency, and his emotional transformation occurs via summary ("realized the truth") rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.9)
    Character motivation is abstract ("reforge a bond beyond death") and resolved through diagnostic assertion rather than dramatized struggle. Interiority relies on label-speak ("weight of centuries," "reluctant metamorphosis") rather than embodied emotion, resulting in a flat arc where the protagonist accepts a profound change with minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on aesthetic labels ("onyx-ink cartomancer") and stated emotions rather than embodied reactions. Elara’s internal state is described via abstract summary ("unmoored," "regret") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a passive vessel for the theme rather than an agent of change; she follows the instructions of a disembodied voice rather than making difficult choices. Her motivation is abstract and label-heavy ("understand the texture of transformation") rather than dramatized through conflict or specific desire. The "destitute philanthropist" trait is expository backstory that does not inform her present-moment tactics or reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("vigilant nature," "calmly inventive spirit") rather than demonstrated behavior. Elara faces no genuine internal conflict, and the antagonist, Thorne, acts merely as a plot device who capitulates instantly to a single line of dialogue, lacking credible motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character acts as a functional avatar for prompt requirements rather than a living consciousness; motivation is "singular" and stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The "curse" functions as a convenient tool to solve the plot without exacting the "sanity" cost claimed in the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("censored poet," "fugitive") rather than embodied behavior. Emotions are summarized in lists ("fear, hope, regret") instead of dramatized, and the "furiously tranquil" oxymoron renders the internal state opaque and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characters function primarily as mouthpieces for the theme rather than living people with distinct interiority. The "mechanical arm" is a label-only trait that twitches but never impacts physical capability or cost, and Elias's "diplomatic fierceness" is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.2)
    Character agency is weak; Elias’s decision to end his "molting" cycle occurs without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost. Dialogue functions as thematic billboard rather than revealing personality or subtext, and Clara serves merely as a prop for the protagonist's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character emotion is conveyed through labels ("wistful," "steely longing") rather than embodied reaction or subtext. Elara's sudden "plan" arises from convenient exposition rather than a deeply established trait or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a role rather than a character, lacking internal contradiction or embodied emotion. Her motivation is stated via exposition ("Elara’s motivation was clear") rather than felt through struggle, and she overcomes the antagonist without hesitation or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a thematic vessel for patience rather than a fully realized character with internal contradictions; his motivation ("seeking a color") remains abstract and ungrounded in specific urgency. The emotional arc is linear and therapeutic, lacking the friction of genuine flaws or the pressure of conflicting desires.

Minor slip in diagnostic label-speak during epiphany ("deepest terror: the fear of being forgotten") abstracts rather than embodies peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation to transform obstacles into harmony drives consistent micro-choices like striking notes, embodied in the mallet's warmth and bare feet on driftwood; lacks deeper internal contradiction beyond restlessness, but earns resolution without unmotivated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation rooted in mentor's map and patterns compels descent and test; interiority embodied in "heart pounding" hesitation and steady voice at climax. Contradictory resolve (dread vs. trust) acts in tunnel choice. Final purpose earned with shell's warmth, foreclosing doubt at cost of immense task.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Diagnostic label-speak ("emotionally rational") and lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously flatten interior conflict; no micro-choices under pressure reveal flaws, making epiphany feel unearned despite clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stoically sensitive trait labeled early but lacks embodied contradiction during repairs; final transformation feels told via epiphany summary rather than micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation to trace origins is consistent but told via labels like "dappled resolve" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final purpose shift lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure, as in the map alignment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong interiority and embodied grief (hands stilled, trembling unfold) with contradictory craft-vs-feel impulses acting in basilica scene; earned change via prior denial culminates in crane unfolding. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("man he was becoming") avoids deeper flaw impact on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority relies on abstract epiphanies like "jolt of clarity shot through her" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; final change feels told rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotions (heart raced, mind racing) and micro-choices (drone deployment, chart study) align with motivation to decode belonging, earning the final resolve; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interiority with embodied guilt (gasping, trembling legs) and contradictory impulses (fabricate vs grasp morality), earning the final renunciation; micro-choices like aligning the watch reveal values under pressure. Minor label-speak ("hollow," "weight of unspoken words") dilutes particularity without fully embodying in peak memory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's micro-choices with the drawer pull and empathetic dialogue reveal consistent traits under pressure; Kael's nod feels earned through relational crucible. Internal conflict is embodied via cold air and hand-turning ritual. Minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful nature") slightly abstracts embodiment without peak harm.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's interior conflict—compass trust vs pole adaptation—shows contradictory impulses acting in scene; embodied emotions via tracing compass and wobbling legs ground her; final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like carrying scarred kayak.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation rooted in past fragments compels immersion choices effectively; embodied panic on ball drop reveals character under pressure. Internal conflict between erasure and lingering echoes acts in scene but resolves via summary epiphany rather than peak contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond intensifies credibly through reluctant power-stirring and conjuring, with embodied shiver and trembling; internal conflict shows in hesitation before whispering to conjure. Final self-realization earns closure via prior causality but borders on unembodied epiphany at "the bond she sought was not with another but with herself."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Strong interiority and embodied regret culminate in earned shift at palm press ("stone in her chest" to tears), with contradictory impulses (duties vs. family) driving micro-choices like shedding cloak. Flawless solo-POV execution under pressure. Final renunciation of burdens feels character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pacifist resolve anchors motivation consistently, enabling the final endurance of shadow work with felt cost in spirit lightening. Interiority concrete in grips on tear and heart racing amid steady resolve, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—mostly declarative traits without deep embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation to grasp transformation intensifies through embodied reluctance and release of cherished bugs, earning the final realization; contradictory pull between planned climb and whisper shown in micro-hesitation before turning. Past prophecies anchor reflection without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation roots in guarded knowledge and revolution, shown via puzzle-solving micro-choices; Thorne applies secondary pressure effectively. Interiority concrete in "heart quickened" under confrontation. Minor label-speak in "calmly inventive spirit flared" slightly abstracts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation clear and consistent, driving rock placement and dust scattering; interior visions embodied but epiphany in "In that instant, Kael understood" borders unearned without deeper contradiction. Flaws like sanity edge balance competence. Micro-choices reveal values under ritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interior contradiction in hesitation over envelope, embodied in trembling hands and timer vigil; shift to writing earned by scar-map realization with felt cost of confronting past. Minor slip in abstract "singular clarity" phrasing avoids 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mechanical arm integrates well into gestures revealing pressure, but final realization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward summary epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation clear and intensifies via letters' jolt of recognition, earning rooftop permanence; embodied emotions in "felt a jolt." Weakness: molting trait told without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting interior conflict depth.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority concrete via piano, clock, and film memories, but leans on labels like "steely longing"; final endurance earned as she plays new melody embracing fate instead of forcing encore.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Motivation clear and consistent in Elara's mission, intensifying via fraying memory signs; interiority concrete in "heart steady" and "mind racing" at creature confrontation. Limited embodied contradiction or flaws complicating choices, with heroic steadiness feeling archetypal rather than struggled.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Slow-spoken trait particularized through patient study of objects and steady reading of letters aloud, earning release of regret; embodied hands-on compass and lace ground interiority without therapy-speak; minor stock phrasing like "weary soul" slips but doesn't touch closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s quiet obsession and scientific lens are credibly sketched; her decision to “experiment” with the dust feels organic to her researcher reflex. Interiority stays concrete—gloves, chill, shimmer—rather than label-laden. Yet her want (“strip away needless drama”) is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes that goal, so change arrives as gentle confirmation, not costly choice. The butterfly materialization is beautiful but externally granted; she is observer, not actor, at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s “steadily adaptive” trait is dramatized twice—she chooses to read frost as text and later to turn artist-knowledge into rescue tactics—so interiority links to visible micro-choices. Emotions stay body-level (“breath visible,” “fingers tracing”) rather than label-speak. The apprentice is missing, so relationship crucible is off-page; still, the choice to act rather than retreat is earned and carries felt cost at the kiln-grotto beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied trembling, the tuning fork pressed to her lips—but the “translator of silence” label and “world capsized” summary border on diagnostic speak. Kael appears too late to serve as crucible; their silent exchange is touching yet cost-free. The final renunciation (silence as canvas) is earned by the prior pattern-hunt, but the absence of any tangible price keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s stubbornness is named, not shown—no scene beats where it blocks or forces a choice with visible cost. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“giving rest a permanent address”) without contradictory impulse under pressure. The lens-assembly quest is linear; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values or new flaw. Closure is a gentle uplift, not an earned renunciation or charged poise; cost is felt only generically.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mara’s motivation is declared early and never contradicted, but interiority stays generic: “heart pounding,” “weight of her secret suddenly lighter.” No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she never considers abandoning the runs or fears exposure beyond a momentary freeze. The final “peace she hadn’t known in years” is told, not embodied. Micro-choices (ringing the bell, stepping into light) advance plot yet reveal no deeper value hierarchy or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—her trembling hands, breath slowing, the pendant’s weight “anchoring her to the moment”—but the internal contradiction promised in the 9+ gate (competing impulses acted in-scene) never arrives. She moves from wonder to wonder without a micro-choice that visibly costs her; the moment she might refuse or cling is skipped. The earned change (she leaves “ready to heal the world”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels imported rather than paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific—her trembling hands, the “texture of time” obsession—but the emotional turn at the pedestal feels rushed; the ancestor torrent is told, not embodied. The micro-choice to place the fragment is present, yet the cost (loss of the fragment, altered self) is asserted rather than felt on the page. Still, the hedge-maze obsession drives every beat, so motive stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The liberator’s motivation is clear and consistent—retrieve seeds before the wall falls—and their chained state physically embodies the cost. Interiority stays sparse but embodied; emotion is shown through deliberate action rather than label. The final shedding of chains is a clean visual renunciation, though the interior cost of that freedom is told more than felt. Still, the character reads as a single, coherent will under pressure, never diluted by exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    The interior contradiction—seeking to recreate the sound of shattering trust in order to let it go—drives every micro-choice; the body-memory of the “resonant ache” embodies this. Motivation stays rooted in Elara’s synesthetic flaw, and the final renunciation (“not something to be feared, but understood”) is earned by the painstaking collection sequence. No secondary characters on page, so status/relationship bullets are waived. The moment she presses palm to hull and feels “a silence shaped like a scream” crystallizes hierarchy of values: comprehension over safety. Cost is felt: the forge brands the absence into her chest, foreclosing ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses (thief vs. seeker) are dramatized in the flower-code beat; the renunciation of stealing the jar carries visible cost when she accepts Elara’s story. Interiority stays concrete—“her heart ached at the thought”—without therapeutic label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: rearranging the bouquet > taking the jar > choosing to reinterpret, each step foreclosing a path. Flaw—quietly savvy trait is told more than shown under pressure; no tactical mistake compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the glassblowing micro-choices (“careful handling, lest it crack”) externalize her fear of vulnerability with visible cost. The grandmother-bookmark bridge and vow to protect curiosity supply a coherent motive chain that culminates in placing the bookmark inside the final sphere—an earned renunciation of control. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the emotional progression is linear rather than layered with credible irrationality, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete—fear of identity-theft is shown through tactile contact with the shell and cast, not labeled. The “trembling certainty” refrain embodies contradiction under pressure. Micro-choice chain (trace shell → lift cast → decrypt → take key → enter mirror room) links motive to action, but the mirror epiphany drifts toward tidy self-actualization rather than a flaw-compounding mistake; cost is felt but not dramatized as irreversible. Voice stays distinct; no occupational stunt detail is needed here.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The oracle’s obsession is declared (“singular: to draw a map of an endless night”) but is never tested by an external obstacle or a costly choice; interiority stays abstract (“eyes gleamed with quiet intensity”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the mild obsession remains a label. The final smile registers as a static beat rather than an earned stance with price. Because the character neither loses nor renounces anything visible, the arc feels stalled at the level of premise.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    Unit-7’s interior contradiction—programmed janitor vs. seeker of thought’s origin—remains abstract; no micro-choice under pressure shows this war. The “remarkably composed” label is repeated but never tested by a moment where composure cracks or costs. The violin pickup is curiosity, not decision; the climax is a passive realization, not an earned renunciation. No visible flaw complicates action, so the arc feels intellectually tidy, not dramatically costly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on damp ticket, the cracked lens as silent companion—but the interior contradiction is stated (“honesty felt risky”) rather than dramatized in body or choice until the final slide. The micro-choice of folding her own doodles carries cost, yet Kian’s instant smile flattens the relational pressure that had been promised. Secondary pressure from crystals is poetic but never alters her tactics; mistrust thaws too easily to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through gnarled-hand work, patient ritual, and the marble-cupping gesture; his pragmatic streak silently overrides futility with each deliberate polish. The contradiction between “withered” body and precise motion embodies conflict without label-speak. A single sustained POV keeps interior access consistent; the final renunciation—he places the last marble, accepting imperfection—carries visible cost. Micro-choices (polish, place, pause) are legible and scale to length.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is character-specific and anchored in bodily tension (“her knuckles whitening”); contradictory impulses appear in the hesitation-calibration sequence. Final lever choice feels earned, but “icy warmth” is asserted rather than embodied in the moment of cost; emotional state drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once. Competence balanced with visible risk; no secondary pressure from another character, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clara’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—her fingers “brushing” the floor, the paper dissolving—yet her interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“inexplicable pull,” “echo the longing in her own heart”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance crystallizes cleanly: she accepts conduit-status, enduring the dissolution of the program and the vanishing guide, a renunciation that forecloses her former silence. Still, the absence of any on-page micro-choice that *risks* tangible loss (time, bodily safety, social credit) keeps the cost more conceptual than visceral. Cap at 6.7 because motivation is legible and coherent but lacks the hairline flaw of embodied cost that would let it reach 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her auroral sorrow is embodied (fingers smudging ink, visual blur) and her contradictory impulse to preserve yet distort the flower drawing is dramatized. “Fault-tolerant oracle” remains a label until the final beat; her unique power is told, not tested under pressure. The renunciation—accepting imperfect truth—is earned and felt on the last page, satisfying the 9+ cost test despite the late, abstract reveal of gift mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s “reckless” label is asserted but never dramatized—she steps cautiously, follows noise obediently, and the one risk (inserting the wheel) is presented as destiny, not choice. Interiority leans on stock phrases (“heart quickened,” “breath caught”) rather than embodied contradiction. The father–daughter conflict is back-story summary; no live relationship tests her stance. Closure obeys causality but the cost feels symbolic rather than personal—she is unchanged except for a stated “peace.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is textured through tactile ritual (tracing the swan, “grip…looser”) and her witnessing stance is credibly strained by the library’s “heavier” air, but the decisive pivot—choosing to follow the map—arrives in a single declarative sentence without visible interior cost; the moment feels administered rather than wrested. The earned change (she “had become the silence”) is asserted in summary, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s interiority drifts into gentle abstraction (“wonder felt infinite”) without embodying contradiction under pressure; her single decisive act—offering the curl—reads as therapeutic gesture rather than costly choice. Finn’s shift is observed from outside, so the relational crucible never forces Elara into a perilous micro-choice. The curl’s glow is magical payoff, yet no prior flaw or misbelief creates stakes for her; she risks nothing, pays nothing. Result: a benevolent witness, not a pressured protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “odd historian” label is shown through her tactile obsession with the tapestry and diary ashes, but interiority drifts into abstract thesis-speak (“displaced axis of humanity’s existence”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows her oddness costing her anything; the ritual succeeds on first try without visible trade-off, softening credibility. The moment she places the fragment on the altar is emotionally flat—no tremor, hesitation, or bodily cost—so the final shift feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is present but drifts into abstract “open secrets” rhetoric; micro-choice is limited to touching the microdot and deciding to travel—both under-motivated. No embodied emotion beyond “sudden surge of clarity.” Earned cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest’s motivation—“illuminate hidden assumptions”—is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice shows why THIS moment matters to HIM. Interiority stays generic (“he knew,” “he felt”) and never embodies fear, doubt, or cost. The palette/black void is handled ritualistically, never altering tactics on the page; thus the final declaration arrives unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    The writer’s interiority is evocative—“chronologically homesick for a time that never truly existed”—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the mapping of memories onto the shell is reported rather than dramatized, so the final slump reads as poetic exhaustion rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic—“the weight of her gift,” “darkness in her own heart”—without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure until the final breath; prior beats are observational. Closure renunciation is declared, not dramatized; cost is asserted (“felt lighter”) rather than shown. Tablet-as-mirror device is clever but Elara’s values hierarchy never shifts on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused hands “tracing the half-finished drum” embodies vocation and loss—but the emotional thaw is declared (“the numbness was gone”) rather than shown through contradictory body cues. The single-POV default is met; no secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Micro-choice is present (she picks up the broken needle, chooses to reverse songs), yet the shift from skepticism to desperate belief is compressed into one sentence of summary, muting the cost. Closure is earned—she weeps and taps the drum—but the causality is telescoped, not lived beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingers brushing the tube, the weight in his pocket—and his credibly curious trait drives two visible micro-choices (uncapping the tube, climbing the tower). Integrity-versus-solitude conflict is dramatized when he crosses the quarantine fence, forfeiting sanctuary; the cost is felt in the final image of the courtyard now charged with duty. Masked figure’s dialogue is too expository, draining relational pressure, and the follower thread evaporates without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and scent-bound, but Elias’s contradictory impulses stay summary-level; the vial makes him act, yet the moment he uncorks it is under-dramatized, so the earned cost feels reported rather than embodied. Micro-choices (touching, hesitating, uncorking) are present, but none carry a visible trade-off that forecloses a live option; grief is accepted, not chosen against a competing path. The sister-memory scenes are evocative, yet they function as exposition rather than crucible pressure on him now. Still, the aromatic caution trait is consistently threaded through perception and action, giving the character a distinctive, if passive, coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—freedom as both gift and exile—anchors every beat; the rope’s weight in his palm embodies the cost of prior escape and foreshadows the coming mirroring. Micro-choices (kneeling to trace patterns, coiling and surrendering the rope) externalize the hierarchy of values without summary labels. Final Earned Stasis—placing the rope beside the mirror—pays off the established flaw of seeking external answers; the solitude he accepts is priced on-page. Voice stays idiosyncratic (“texture of time,” “poem to write—and rewrite”) with no therapy-speak intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but leans on abstract labels (“the world itself had grown weary of sound”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final renunciation is telegraphed rather than forced by a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “professionally thorough” trait is shown only in posture-checking the pouch; no consequential error or cost tests it. Interiority is rich (“heart ached faintly”) yet stays safe—no contradiction under pressure. The single on-page choice—dissolving the petal—is smooth but foreseen, so the cost feels decorative rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “shrewd” trait is asserted but never shown in a cargo decision; the locket photo is handled twice but doesn’t force a hard choice. Interiority stays generic (“mind racing,” “felt compelled”) without embodied contradiction. Final meeting is pleasant but no cost or value hierarchy is tested; the friendship simply blooms.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s longing to belong is palpable from the first paragraph, embodied in her calloused fingers and the obsessive sculpting of the arbor; her interiority stays concrete (“luminescent ache” becomes a running pulse). The contradiction between her need for kinship and her outsider status drives every micro-choice—she questions residents, alters her sculptures, travels beyond the orchard—each action visibly tightening her investment. Flaw is present but not safety-hedged: she risks ridicule and exhaustion yet keeps going, and the final earned stasis (accepting Echo’s tag as welcome) costs her the fantasy of discovering a secret savior. Voice convergence is minimal; only Echo speaks, and the line “You’ve been searching for me…” is intentionally disembodied rather than a competing idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s illustrator vocation is named but never weaponised; no drawing choice alters the plot. Interiority drifts into abstract “wave of understanding” rather than embodied contradiction. The final sketch is asserted, not dramatised, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and grief are named but not dramatized; she never hesitates, doubts, or pays an on-page price. The “strange pull” and “buried optimism” are abstract labels, not embodied contradiction. Her mentor’s journal changes her plan, yet we get no micro-choice that shows risk or cost. The story stays in summary mode, so characterization feels illustrative rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward label-speak ("their motivation burned brighter now") rather than embodied contradiction; the single micro-choice—unearthing fragments—never endangers or forecloses anything, so the "visible cost" test fails; kindly/methodical is asserted, never shown to complicate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied; the leaf as mirror is a sustained, contradiction-laden image that drives her micro-choices. The shift from control to surrender is visible in tactile rearranging of pots, not just summary. “Circuitously sincere” is shown via her winding self-interrogation, not labeled. Cost is felt: the leaf dissolves, her clothes are drenched, the nursery’s governance is relinquished—an earned stasis that forecloses the old life.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s insomniac-painter vocation seeds her restless seeing, but her interiority drifts into generic “search for meaning” rather than a concrete want that tightens choices; the brooch-triggered shift to “keeper of stories” is declared, not dramatized through a visible cost or irreversible renunciation. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; she simply receives the book and paints. The earned-stasis closure is present yet under-pressured because the stakes never narrow to a fork where she could lose something.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clairvoyant who missed her own calling—is vivid, but the epiphany is delivered in summary (“she understood”) rather than dramatized micro-choice; the merge with the cave is announced, not embodied. No secondary character on page, so status dynamics N/A; the endurance accepted at exit is credible but the cost is conceptual, not felt in body or forfeiture. Voice drifts into cosmic certainty (“bridge the gap between seen and unseen”) that flattens the flaw that was supposed to drive her. Still, the gift-as-blindness premise is specific and the renunciation lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—doubt vs. conviction—stays live in-scene (grip tightening on valve, tremor on wood). The final acceptance is earned by prior discoveries and costs her the safety of scholarly detachment. Status shift with the gray-cloaked woman is legible but under-utilized; micro-choice hierarchy is clear yet not pushed to a second external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trembling certainty” embodies the dare/renunciation axis—but the punch’s hold on her is asserted more than dramatized; we see her raise it, not feel the cold brass sear her palm or alter her pulse. The blank ticket moment is the only visible cost, and it lands cleanly, so the arc satisfies the 9- gate, yet the absence of a second beat where the punch actually hurts or brands her keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s skeptical-sympathetic duality is shown through her garden-tending and star-gazing routines, but the interior contradiction never tightens under pressure; the tile’s pull is accepted without visible internal argument, so the decisive surrender feels smooth rather than costly. Micro-choices (climbing the tower, transcribing) track her trait, yet the final stance crystallizes more by assertion than by earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elyr’s boredom is vivid early, but the interiority turns abstract (“aching void,” “monotonous cycle”) and the pivotal choice to seize the fragment is asserted rather than dramatized with contradictory impulse. The closing shift from void to “spark of purpose” is declared, not embodied; no micro-cost is shown on the page. Still, the immortal fatigue is specific enough to keep him from cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s honest-child trait is anchored early and drives the final confrontation; her refusal to keep lying is embodied in the trembling hand-off of the ink pot. Father’s shift from irritation to tentative hand-hold is credible, but his interiority is only sketched—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in him, so the relationship crucible feels one-sided. Micro-choices (touching the pot, holding it out) are concrete and cost-earned. Still, the moment of paternal softness feels slightly convenient because his prior schemes stay off-page; we see only her pressure, not his.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority stays at a polite distance; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the “earnest, studious” label never collides with a visible flaw or cost. The final beat—tucking the notepad away—records rather than enacts a choice, leaving the arc a flat accumulation instead of a charged renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    The wanderer’s “nameless” identity and death-certificate glitch are evocative labels, but interiority stays abstract: we never see a contradictory impulse acted out in real time. Emotion is summarized (“their heart quickened”) rather than embodied through sensory or behavioral tells. The final stance—guardian of the forgotten—is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly forecloses an alternate path. The concept is strong, yet the character remains a silhouette rather than a pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—myth-buster training vs. hunger for the ineffable—anchors every micro-choice; the final renunciation of “solving” for “living the riddle” is foreshadowed by her instinctive bow speed-up. Embodied emotion is precise: fingers brushing cracked shell, breath catching as room tilts. The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“she realized that her quest had never been about finding an answer”—that momentarily ventriloquizes the theme instead of letting the cello’s dying note do it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s “culture-shock absorber” label is asserted, never dramatized; we are told she’s exhausted but see no contradictory impulses under pressure. The foundation-stone moment supplies a warm tingle, yet her ensuing tactics (reorganize rounds, stage festival) read as managerial rather than embodied crisis. Interiority lapses into stock phrasing (“burned brighter than ever”) and no visible flaw complicates her path; the ending renunciation is projected, not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s grief-tinged duty is sketched with tactile micro-choices (hand brushing pouch, steadying voice) that embody her mentor’s creed. The interior contradiction—obey mission control vs honor dead mentor—activates only late; prior beats are largely observational, so the renunciation feels more declared than dramatized. Still, the final clench of the sand grain gives a visible, scaled cost that satisfies the 600-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich and vocationally specific; her blindness is shown through how she senses air shifts and refracted light rather than declared. The micro-choice to trust the drone’s hum over visual inspection crystallizes her values, yet the traveler remains a prop—not a crucible—so relationship pressure is absent. No genuine flaw complicates the repair; competence dominates struggle. Still, her calm renunciation of spectacle for craft carries a quiet, felt cost that earns the ending’s poise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically sketched—her “storm of thoughts,” the atlas work, the phrasebook as talisman—but we witness no true contradictory impulse in-scene; the decision to follow the mist reads as calm inevitability rather than costly choice. The “subtly confident” tag is asserted repeatedly yet never tested by a visible gamble, failure, or renunciation, so the promised complexity stays off-page. Backstory is cleanly anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR rules, but the climax lacks a palpable price or forked path that would make the arc feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s “infinitely patient” trait is shown through walking rather than told, but interiority stays generic (“he smiled, knowing…”) and no contradictory impulse ever threatens his resolve; the final stance costs nothing because he meets zero resistance. The absence of any live antagonist or micro-choice under pressure keeps him a graceful silhouette rather than a tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid in the memory-flood, but the pivot from panic to serene discovery feels abrupt; no embodied contradiction plays out in-scene. “Lonesome splendor” is named repeatedly rather than shown through idiosyncratic reaction. The final stance shift is stated, not dramatized with a micro-choice that costs her anything visible. Oxygen stakes evaporate once visions start, undermining credibility of her stress response.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s desire to redeem the family name is clear, but interiority slips into paraphrase (“he wanted to be heard”) rather than embodied contradiction. The lattice as inherited guilt is evocative, yet the turn away from “hush” to “truth” is declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ghost bride’s longing to repay a “debt across lifetimes” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a concrete on-page choice; she kneels, clutches, and “steps into the endless night,” yet none of these micro-moves carry a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses a path. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous connection”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat promises “freedom and reckoning,” but the story withholds what is actually risked or refused, so the arc lands as mood rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“she let the image seep into her”), but her motives remain monolithic—no contradictory impulse ever threatens the mission. Actions align with the poetic wharf weaver label, yet the story never risks her perfection; no visible flaw complicates a stitch. The earned-stasis closure is credible because the cost is the lifelong devotion already spent, but we still witness only one emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—“faith shattered,” “sense of belonging”—without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that shows her risking anything tangible. The only concrete decision is placing the sundial base, yet the text summarizes weeks of digging rather than dramatizing a single moment where her curiosity collides with fear or doubt. Warm curiosity is asserted, never tested against a live obstacle that would force her to pay or renounce. The arc lands in emotional summary, not earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s “carefully inventive” trait is shown through tactile decoding and the clipboard-as-shield, but interiority lapses into abstract labels (“sense of futuristic nostalgia”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels performed, not cost-bearing; no flaw compounds or forecloses a path. Still, micro-choices (kneeling, trembling hands) align with motive and the pacing of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers weaving star-threads while the flame pulses in counter-rhythm—but the moment she faces Lira her contradictory impulses are told (“Elara’s mind raced”) rather than embodied. The dagger-at-boot reflex is a nice micro-choice, yet the later decision to “synchronize” is asserted, not dramatized through visible cost. Mentor-loss trauma is invoked as backstory label, not lived scar. Closure earns partial credit: she foregoes sleep/safety to finish the chart, but the cost is implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skin “prickled,” the shard “trembled”—and her motive to exhume unspoken apologies is concrete. Yet the moment of reading her own letter, the story pivots on summary (“she knew what she had to do”) rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The contradiction between fear and need is stated, not dramatized in a single beat we can watch her body betray. Closure is felt, but the decisive act is interiorized, so the earned cost is lightly under-lit.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—condensation traced like tears, wrist numbed from prior deciphering—and her micro-choice to carry the child’s decoded plea into the night crystallizes her value hierarchy. The “shrewdly innocent” trait surfaces once, but never complicates or forecloses a tactical option, so it stays ornamental. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the ache is declared rather than tested under competing pressure. The final determination feels earned because the decoded map materially alters her next step, but the emotional cost is only asserted, not embodied in a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s longing for lost joy is anchored early and her micro-choice to kneel at the fresco fragment signals a believable pivot. Interiority stays concrete—her fingers brush stone, tears stream while she paints—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of wall-for-fog canvas is earned because the film-projected memories dramatize why preservation matters. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene; emotion is embodied but not complex enough under peak pressure to reach 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority remains vivid and embodied—her fingers “trace,” she “hums,” she “conducts”—but the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity is told more than dramatized; the moment she “nodded” is summary, not a micro-choice we witness under pressure, so the cost feels soft rather than carved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is sketched with appealing cinematic tags (rogue scholar, cloak, dagger) but remains a bundle of traits rather than a psyche: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only asserted (“his heart quickened,” “chaos converging in his chest”). The moment he could reveal hierarchy-of-values—deciphering under threat—gets narrated in convenient competence instead of visible wavering or cost. Interiority resorts to stock movie language (“charm kicking in”) rather than linguist-specific perception. No interior conflict is staged in the present beat; everything is stated, then ratified by Dr. Krane’s instant approval, so the promised rogue vulnerability never complicates the tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.7)
    The poet’s drive to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a concrete choice that costs her anything; the postcard-touching and lullaby-singing are ritualized rather than pressured. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“restless mind,” “weight of centuries”) instead of embodied contradiction. No visible flaw complicates her path; she proceeds untested, so the climactic “surge of inspiration” feels unearned. The final smile lands as performance, not stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic—no contradictory impulses collide on the page; the single moment of “trembling” is performed, not embodied. Her decision to sing is declared, not wrestled with; cost is poetic (“heart heavy”) rather than tactile. The caretaker role remains label-deep—no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Closure is gentle stasis, but because no prior flaw or hunger is dramatized, the renunciation feels pre-ordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” interior contradiction is dramatized in the quill-dip beat and carries into the final image, earning the renunciation of silence. Embodied trembling + micro-choice to write in “language of her heart” give concrete cost. Mentor status shift is legible in single line of dialogue. No label-speak; flaw complicates choice and is accepted, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his “mind worked like the gears of the floodgates”—and his micro-choice to sketch the compromise in the dust is embodied. Yet the contradictory impulses promised in the prompt (“slyly heartfelt”) never collide in a single beat; the poem-chain delivers a ready-made ethos instead of forcing him to improvise under pressure. Cost is asserted, not dramatized: we are told the village and scholars both accept, but Elias pays no visible price for his decryption. The result is a competent arc that never quite becomes a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s grief-rooted quest is emotionally coherent, but her “half-truths” remain abstract; we never see a single lie told or a specific consequence, so the interior paradox is declared instead of dramatized. The turnaround from forging history to writing “truth” is declared in a single paragraph without a visible catalytic choice; cost is asserted (“she had preserved herself”) rather than shown. Pigeon-training beats are atmospheric but do not force her to act against her flaw; the meteorite functions as emotional shorthand rather than a decision-driver. Earned stasis is hinted at but not crystallized on the page—no forfeiture, no irreversible act—so the arc feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rendered in lyrical, abstract language that sometimes drifts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she found a strange kind of closure”). The featherly-determination trait is mentioned but not embodied in a moment of visible cost; the final renunciation feels inferred rather than dramatized. Motive is tracked consistently, yet the micro-choice that seals her leave-taking is summarized, not staged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather anchors contradictory memory/loss. Micro-choices (sketching, hand to glass, final dance) externalize shift from observer to participant. No second character, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Motivation stays consistent; final renunciation costs her the city but feels earned. Lacks one extra contradiction under peak pressure to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s interiority glimmers—her need to recover the lost “grandmother’s laughter” supplies a personal stake that undergirds every seed-and-glass beat. Emotions are tenderly embodied (“as if it were a key”), but we hear abstract labels (“longing, warmth, belonging”) more than contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation—paths vanish so they can be found again—earns its poise through prior tries, yet the cost is conceptual, not palpable. Micro-choices stay inside a single register; no genuine struggle/flaw complicates her competence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s lightly-attentive gaze and bishop-guided choreography give him a sharp, idiosyncratic lens, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“he had once been a cog…”) rather than dramatized on-page. The climax—starlight striking the bishop—externalizes the shift without forcing a renunciation or visible cost; he pockets the piece and walks on, path unchanged. No micro-choice in the final beat forecloses an option or exacts a price, so the arc feels ornamental rather than crucible-tested. Still, his perceptual signature and embodied orchestration lift the portrait above stock types.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s interiority stays lyric and embodied; her trembling hand and rooted feet externalize the exile’s cost. The contradiction—yearning to fledge yet standing still—runs through every micro-choice until the sentinel’s arrival crystallizes her refusal. No secondary crucible on page, so relationship bullet waived; the self-as-crucible is credible. Motive progression is clear, but the absence of a visible flaw that could compound keeps her just shy of the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s interiority is lush—“he read between the lines of life itself”—but the promised contradiction or micro-choice under pressure never arrives; he watches, tosses, then simply decides to “share,” a reversal the text summarizes rather than dramatizes with cost. The glazier persona is evocative, yet occupational detail never constrains a beat or influences the final action, so motive stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the epiphany—“he began to enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance”—is stated rather than dramatized; no micro-choice visible on the page where he actively relinquishes or forecloses a path. The feather visions function as exposition of others’ pain rather than forcing Elias to risk anything new. Competence and scars are evoked, yet no flawed decision or irreversible loss is shown; thus the change feels observational, not earned. Voice is textured, but the lack of a costly final act caps this below the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “logical dreamer” trait shows in the tactile salvaging of the gauge and the quiet decision to treat beauty as logic. Yet the only genuine pressure is the tide erasing her shells; no contradictory want/fear is activated, so the change feels gentle rather than costly. The renunciation of permanence is credible, but the interior contradiction never tightens into a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is concrete—she kneels, trembles, registers the ivy’s curl—yet the “legacy burden” remains abstract, never narrowing her choices until the final mirror beat. The micro-choice to press the wall is present, but the contradiction between obsessive mapping and sudden acceptance of “being their voice” isn’t dramatized; the cost is felt only in the closing lyric image, not in a prior beat where she might have rejected that role.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s calm is vividly embodied in micro-gestures (trembling hands after the final note), and her sacrificial lending of heartbeat supplies a clear, scaled cost. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and her refusal to claim credit forecloses personal glory. The absence of on-page secondary characters limits relationship-as-crucible, and the borrowed-heartbeat mechanic is accepted rather than questioned, keeping her just shy of the 8-band where contradiction under pressure would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s interiority is serviceable—“ebony clipboard clutched tightly” and “voice broke” give embodied beats—but the turn from negotiator to woman-who-has-suffered is announced rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene; the final plea is a speech, not a visible choice that costs her a concrete option. The clipboard-as-symbol is external commentary; it never constrains or betrays her in the moment. Earned, but only just; the cost is asserted, not staged.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interior contradiction is present—profit-driven eco-criminal now risking all for one egg—but the amoral facet is asserted rather than enacted on-page; no beat shows her calculating self-interest clashing with sentiment. Embodied emotion is thin: “trembling hands” is generic, and the memory-flash of birdsong is summary, not sensory. The micro-choice to bury the egg is single and late; earlier walking/scanning is undifferentiated. Closure cost is conceptual (she might lose everything) but not dramatized or felt in body or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“chaste courtesan” paradox is stated, not dramatized; body-poetic trait is invoked but never tested under pressure, so cost feels honorary rather than earned. No contradictory impulse acts in scene; the untangling is calm, mistake-free, almost ritual. The smile at the end signals poise, not renunciation with visible price; motivation stays abstract—“defy conformity”—without micro-choices that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical but drifts toward label-speak (“ethical dilemmas,” “quiet yet powerful force”) rather than embodied contradiction; serenity is asserted, not dramatized under pressure. The reversal choice is credible yet cost feels intellectual, not visceral—no prop, body, or social price is risked on-page. Missing a second character denies relationship crucible; puppet shows remain off-stage so occupational detail never pressures choice. Earned stasis is present but the emotional tariff is muffled by abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her fingers pause, she hums to anchor herself—but the contradiction between “honor histories” and building intentionally ephemeral signals is never dramatized; the moth-wing spiral is lovely yet costs her nothing and changes no tactic. Micro-choices (adding the monarch wing) are present but feel decorative because no external or relational pressure tests them. The result is a credible, sensorily embodied observer who never risks or forfeits anything; the stance crystallizes but the cost is only atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. tenderness—shows in every touch of rope and metal; the “snowmelt ardor” line crystallizes her thaw under pressure. Motive (preserve forgotten names) is constant, yet the story withholds any micro-choice that could fail or cost her materially; the illumination succeeds exactly as hoped, so the arc is emotional confirmation rather than earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak, but the absence of a visible price on the page keeps her change shy of high-band “felt cost.”

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Foresight’s obsession is declared early and the final “resonance” epiphany is internally consistent, but the piece never lets us watch a real-time choice that costs something; the bunker ritual is all trance and no fork. Interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“consciousness expanding”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The result is a credible arc, yet one that feels observed rather than risked.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kael’s “frugal” and “empirically ironic” labels are announced but never bite him—no moment where thrift blocks or enables access, no scene where skepticism collides with mystic encounter. Interiority floats in generic cosmic yearning (“secrets beyond human comprehension”) rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thought. The closing covenant is accepted without visibleinternal struggle or cost, so the arc is observation→finding→acceptance rather than a pressured change of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction is never shown in action—her tactics are gentle conversation, not strategic maneuver. Kael’s resentment softens via a single remembered sensation, but the moment is narrated rather than dramatized with bodily cost, so the shift feels therapeutic rather than earned. Interiority drifts into self-help cadence (“Resentment is heavy…”) that flattens contradiction. Still, the pair’s status tension is cleanly staged and the final sigh carries a visible micro-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s yearning for “boundaries dissolved” is anchored early; her grounded pragmatism collides with that desire inside the sextant repair, yielding embodied micro-choices (“hands moving without conscious direction”) that dramatize the contradiction. The final smile/stance crystallizes an earned poise—she pays no external price, yet the fleeting threshold crossing costs her prior certainty, satisfying Earned Stasis. Wanderer remains a scenic prop; no status crucible, so relationship bullet stays neutral. Interiority avoids label-speak, but “runaway dream” edges toward abstraction; still, it is tethered to on-page sensory cues (frost, fog, glass glow) that keep it from drifting into pure trope.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “brushing the ribbon” while “a thought forming” shows embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to weave the ribbon into the tree crystallizes her values under pressure. Flaw traction is light: “quartz-eye” remains a label rather than altering perception or risk. Still, the maternal regret is particular and drives every tactical move; the cost is felt when she foregoes restoring the old vow and instead crafts a new covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is credibly anchored to her occupation and prior hunger for “forbidden knowledge,” but the interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“simply complicated,” “nonlinear inheritance”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under pressure; the single micro-choice—clutching the cameo—does re-weight her stance, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized. Secondary keeper figure functions only as exposition mouthpiece, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, motives stay consistent and the closing resolve feels earned within the lyric-situational design.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly asserted but only shown once (bypassing traps); interiority is generic (“her mind already racing”) and emotions are labeled, not embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; the final bargain is clever but won too easily, so cost is intellectual, not felt. Kael is pure plot furniture—zero status friction or micro-choices—so relationship crucible bullet is N/A. Competence swamps struggle; no flaw complicates the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s longing for her twin and the garden is stated gorgeously, but the interior contradiction—why reading strangers’ diaries will “recapture” her own lost memory—never crystallizes; the ship’s stories alter her memory without her actively wrestling the conflict, so the final epiphany feels abstract rather than earned. No micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything concrete; the emerald card dissolves for her rather than by her. Flawed, but the lyrical voice keeps her yearning palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is repeatedly labeled but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; her interiority is smooth, competent, and therefore static. No interior conflict surfaces while she braids—she simply succeeds—so the final “bridge of centuries” moment feels bestowed, not earned. The absence of a visible cost or foreclosed path keeps the arc below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s motive—restore harmony via the “bloom of hush”—is declared early and never complicated by contradictory impulse; interiority is poetic but generic (“her heart steady”), not character-specific. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values; the single decisive act (laying the stone) is abstract, its cost off-page. The ending renunciation is implied, not dramatized, so the required visible cost for 9+ is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s grief-bright conviction that “coincidences have meaning” drives every micro-choice; the memory-forfeit ritual is a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses her past. Interiority is concrete (“hands trembling with thistle-blown hope”) and contradictions (hope vs. erasure) play out in-scene. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she realized”) at the very end; the embodied cost still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s preemptive nostalgia and archivist drive are concrete: she kneels, measures, records; the fog-wall touch forces a sensory rewrite of her goal. Interior contradiction—yearning to preserve while being flooded by volatile memory—stays embodied, not labeled. No second character means status/relationship bullets are waived; the lone flaw is slight competence overbalance—she decodes too smoothly without visible error under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s motive—"to defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared early and repeated, but never complicates: she never doubts, falters, or chooses against her own mantra. Interiority stays on one note of benevolent resolve; no contradictory impulse is enacted in-scene. The only micro-choice with cost—igniting the rag-knot high above her head—reads as heroic confirmation rather than risk or renunciation. Earned change lies in the crowd, not in Lira, so the arc feels external and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—“the texture of time” obsession is particular—but her contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized until the final beat. The shift from discovery to participation is declared, not visibly costed; we see no micro-choice that risks error or burns a bridge. Voice stays consistent, yet the cicada’s agency overshadows hers, muting the crucible effect. Still, the perceptual signature is strong enough to keep her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s fear of confinement and her quirky desire to “taste” silences are vivid, but the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“her chest tightening,” “suffocated by the confines”) rather than embodied contradiction in the moment of crisis. The porcelain doll is handled twice—once as talisman, once dropped-then-retrieved—so its emotional cost is present yet modest; we don’t feel a genuine hierarchy of values being stress-tested. The final stance crystallizes cleanly: she returns changed, no longer containable, so the arc lands, but the micro-choices that got her there are rehearsed rather than discovered under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “teach silence how to comfort” motive is stated early and gently tested by Mira’s agitation, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky micro-choice that costs him anything. His adjustments—steering toward quiet sectors—are smooth, never forcing a trade-off or visible forfeiture, so the renunciation stays conceptual rather than embodied. Mira’s shift is nicely rendered, yet it lands as passenger-side benefit, not crucible pressure on Elias. The result is a warm, serviceable arc that stops short of the felt-cost threshold needed for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s “wisely adventurous” trait is shown through cautious mural-reading and the ruby flake test, but interiority stays generic; no contradictory impulses appear, and the throne renunciation is smooth rather than costly. The flake’s hum is the only embodied emotion; the rest is summary. Micro-choices (peeling paint, placing flake) align with trait, yet no flaw complicates them. Closure reads as epiphany, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is consistently rendered through bodily scars, micro-choice (pressing ring to threshold), and embodied cost (knees buckle, hollow ache). The severed scar-link is a visible forfeiture that forecloses a path, but the “tender” trait is asserted more than dramatized; one more beat showing her gentleness colliding with the need to wound would push this to 8+. Motive remains clear and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “virtuously mischievous” trait is shown only once (bending rules without breaking them) and never complicates her choices under pressure; the pyramid-scheme backstory is told as label, never embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority stays generic (“heart pounding with shadowseam wonder”) and the climactic recognition of her future self is summary, not a contradictory impulse acted upon. No visible flaw or blind spot drives the mistake that activates the portal; competence is unchallenged, so the arc feels safe rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s motive is clear, but interiority drifts into inherited-obsession shorthand (“thick with… forgotten dreams”) rather than her own sensory present. The crank-handle is fondled repeatedly yet never resists or complicates her grip—object fails to pressure her. Grandfather’s voice over-explains her need, so the final “keeper” stance feels bequeathed, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric’s interior contradiction—clinging to a lost joy while craving release—is embodied in the crumpled program and the gauntlet drop; the micro-choice to unsnap carries visible cost. The arc from “withdrawn knight” to “storyteller” is signaled early, but the final label “storyteller” is declared rather than demonstrated through a fresh action, blunting the sense of genuine renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “tactfully hopeful” trait is shown through her gentle handling of relics and the quiet decision to write Liam’s story, but the interiority drifts into thematic paraphrase (“a story of hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The button discovery sparks a micro-choice (cross-referencing, drafting) that credibly alters her evening, yet the emotional cost is declared, not dramatized—no moment where hope visibly collides with archival protocol. Her flaws remain safe: she never risks damaging a file or disobeys policy, so the renunciation feels frictionless. Still, the foster-care context and her own emancipation give the motivation specificity that keeps her above theTemplate-Character line.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s underestimated-rebel trait is set up early and pays off in her risky archive heist, but interiority stays generic (“her heart pounding,” “her mind raced”) and the moment she decodes the ledger is summarized, not embodied. The key-as-defiance symbol is strong, yet her competence feels slightly too smooth—no visible misstep that would dramatize the “underestimated” label under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The saxophonist’s motive is declared—silence a coded prophecy—but stays abstract; no concrete stakes or contradictory impulse inside the luminous grotto. He plays, the grotto reacts, yet we never feel a dilemma or a cost to his body or identity. The “vested hush” is stated, not dramatized as inner friction. Earned renunciation is missing; the victory feels ambient rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s quiet, tactile diligence is vivid, but the interior contradiction promised by the speck’s “pull” stays abstract; we see her “heart race” yet no embodied friction or micro-choice that costs her anything on the spot. The final “shift” is declared rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—longing for certainty while courting imprecision—remains abstract; only the final beat shows micro-choice (leaving the map) that costs him control. Embodied emotion is scarce until the cavern, where the compass’s hum gives a flicker of bodily stakes. Endurance is earned, but the flaw (hubris of mastery) is named more than dramatized. Still, the single POV stays coherent and the renunciation feels credible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive—to grasp the weight of names—remains an abstract wish until the furnace vision forces her to wear that weight; the embodied chill of the iron mouth and the coin’s burn give us one micro-choice that actually costs. Interiority drifts into paraphrased aphorism (“balance between seen and unseen”) and the visions are served as curated summaries, not lived contradiction. Because the decisive turn is told rather than enacted, we feel her acceptance but not the sweaty, throat-tight moment of it.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “modestly fearless” stance is shown, not labeled, in her steady descent. The interior ache under the harp’s weight is concrete, and the moment she palms the warm tooth gives a micro-choice that locks her value hierarchy. Yet her flaw—needing to mend others to soothe her own ache—stays safely implicit; it never complicates the choice or backfires, so the arc is gentle, not crucible-hot. Still, within 750 words the shift from pursuer to midwife of light is credible and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid and body-centric, but the “mathematics of mercy” remains an abstract label; no concrete equation or test is attempted, so motivation never modulates under pressure. The mask-strap drop registers as symbol-only release rather than a micro-choice that costs her something new. Still, trauma responses are embodied well, and her senses sharpen present-tense tension.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lila’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—emotions are named (“promise,” “weight”) rather than embodied in gesture or physiology. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; she glides from beat to beat without micro-choices that cost her anything. The childhood lighthouse memory is recalled, not dramatized, so it tilts the present stance but doesn’t force a visible trade-off. Closure is a quiet lyric fade; the “anchor” is asserted, not tested, so the renunciation feels foreshadowed rather than paid for in blood.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s “peculiar gift” is asserted, not embodied; the ghosts cue him but never complicate his choices. Interiority stays generic (“weightless burden,” “sense of closure”) rather than conflicted. The decisive act—inserting the barrel—mirrors the ghosts’ prompt exactly, so no contradictory impulse or visible cost is legued. No relationship or status crucible on stage; the ghosts serve as chorus, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s monomaniacal drive to “compress eternity into a single, perfect moment” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; she drifts through wonders without a visible hierarchy of values being tested. The bottled whisper alters her situation, yet her response is passive wonder rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything. No contradictory impulse or embodied emotion is shown in-scene; the arc is an accumulation of awe, not a crucible of character.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradiction—romantic visionary vs. exiled scholar—drives every beat; the shard beats in her pocket anchor micro-choices (“she carefully arranged the shard”). Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Final endurance carries visible cost: she walks away still wounded, shard glowing yet unhealed. Flaws complicate rather than decorate; competence is balanced by genuine social erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s curiosity is the only on-page interior driver; “curiosity tugged him” is abstract, not embodied. The chip-box’s trait of wilting near dishonesty is never tested by Elias’s own choices—he never lies, hesitates, or faces a trade-off where honesty matters. The final act of freeing the box is a single external gesture; no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on him. Result: character feels functional but not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid, yet her internal contradictions stay slight; no competing impulse is dramatized at the water’s edge, so the final surrender feels pre-ordained rather than costly. The "sensibly eccentric" tag is asserted but never tripped by a trade-off that hurts her. Her psychometry flare is shown once and never complicates later moves; the beat does not tilt her stance. Grandfather’s absence is backstory prop rather than active pressure on her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s artisan-observer identity is vivid in the opening beat, but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure; her decision to slot the slide is credible yet emotionally flat because interiority lapses into thematic paraphrase (“scaffold complexity with simplicity”) instead of embodied contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned stasis at the end (accepting custodianship) carries modest cost but feels more conceptual than personally lacerating.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, her “quiet drive” shown through sustained night-work and the pilgrimage to the cathedral; the moonflower memory anchors motive without lapsing into label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on page, so the internal conflict remains suggested rather than enacted. The final endurance (“she had captured…her own peace”) is credible but the cost is more asserted than felt. Single-POV design keeps characterization coherent, yet the absence of live opposition limits pressure and micro-choice hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—Elara “felt a glimmer of hope” rather than embodying contradiction under pressure. Single on-page character means no relationship crucible; her micro-choice (arranging debris) is present yet low-stakes because lagoon response is externalized miracle, not driven by her flaw. Backstory capsule (grandfather’s letters) is cleanly cued and tilts present action, satisfying BRR. No earned cost at closure—hope arrives as gift, not renunciation—so arc feels suspended rather than foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid in the opening—her boots crunch, the bottle feels “almost alive,” and her rejection of nostalgia is sharply articulated. Yet her “working memory” method is asserted more than dramatized; we’re told she recalls every text but see no concrete mnemonic image or failure. The final renunciation of rest is credible, but the cost feels external (she simply walks away) rather than embodied or irreversible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “brushing” the shaving, the garden “seeming to sigh”—but the emotional contradiction promised in the 9+ note never surfaces in scene; she moves from curiosity to acceptance without a visible internal fight. The “accidental prophecy” motive is asserted, not dramatized as a competing desire she must risk anything for. Still, her perceptual signature (dead-language ear, tactile engagement with relics) stays consistent, and the final “I remember” lands as credible renunciation with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but generic—no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the “furiously tranquil” tag is announced, never embodied through micro-choice. The bond with the winged creature is declared, not tested, so the climactic readiness feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s “listening” motive is concrete in the bell-rope beats, but interiority drifts into abstract weather-speak (“the silence spoke louder than any siren”). The final stance is earned, yet the contradictory impulse—why tug the rope the second time?—is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost. Competent, not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s quiet pride and spiritual curiosity are asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The lantern-triggered shift from cleaner to cosmic initiate is declared (“she understood”) rather than forced through a costly micro-choice. The final “earned stasis” is credible but thin because the prior interior struggle is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical and consistent, his astonishment quietly embodied in how he studies light and wind. Yet his contradictory impulses—yearning to retreat vs. rising guardianship—are stated more than dramatized; we never feel him physically wrestle with the decision to sing. The final endurance is credible, but the cost is atmospheric rather than viscerally personal. Voice stays individual, no safety-hedging, though micro-choices under pressure could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is serviceable—she acts, touches, decides—but emotions stay at label level (“felt a shift within herself”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the garage-sale plan is clever yet executed in montage, so we see no micro-choice that costs her. The urn fragment warms her once, then becomes a map; the emotional stake of holding eternity in her palm is asserted, not embodied. Closure is mild stasis rather than earned renunciation; the chronometer stabilizes and she “feels belonging,” but no prior flaw or obsession is visibly paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent—‘arranging thoughts like beads on a string’ is concrete—but micro-choices remain observational; no real contradictory impulse under pressure. The feather hand-off is the single pivot; its warmth is stated, not embodied, so the cost feels symbolic rather than lived. Motivation stays static: she already believes in fragments, so the ending restates rather than reweights her stance. Dialogue is soft-parabolic, not individuated; the wanderer’s voice folds into hers, flattening status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “gently systematic” trait is shown through wire-wrapping action, but interiority drifts into generic stewardship language (“bridge between worlds”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the six-month death sentence is accepted with identical serenity, flattening stakes. The final diary entry voices theme instead of revealing a last, costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “luminous skeptic” tag is asserted, not dramatized; her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“the chemistry of homecoming…was not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt”). The moment of softening awe lands, but the causal bridge is abbreviated; we see the shift declared rather than felt in body or choice. Cost is present (she leaves her amber, completing the circuit) yet scaled to lyric closure, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is poetic but generic; “weight of centuries” and “spark of possibility” are label-level abstractions. One micro-choice—placing pods—never complicates under pressure; no contradiction or visible cost. Motivation stays static; renunciation is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “quiet life” and Lira’s faith in his nose are asserted, not embodied; the only micro-choice—turning the phonograph crank—reads as plot lever rather than character test. Interiority stays generic (“curiosity, long dormant, stirred”) and the closing smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse or flaw is dramatized. The leaf’s transformation supplies external wonder but no internal cost, so the arc lands as mild uplift rather than earned stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “chivalrous thief” label is worn, not lived; his only on-page theft is swapping chess pieces, a gesture never shown to cost him anything. Interiority drifts to generic wonder (“something deep within him stirred”) rather than contradictory impulse. The final climb to restore the sky reads as a noble quest, but the text hedges any real moral ambiguity, so the promised thief’s edge never complicates his choices. Earned cost is asserted, not dramatized: no forfeiture, betrayal, or visible price shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—“she too had lived in that shadow”—and her desire to archive small gestures is dramatized when she fingers the pawn-less board and later joins the word-walk. The revelation that her acting was both empathy and evasion lands as credible micro-epiphany, but the beat is compressed into a single clause; we see little contradictory impulse in scene, so the change feels more stated than lived. Kael’s benevolent ruthlessness stays mostly rhetorical; no action shows the ruthless edge, so status tension never sharpens. Overall, enough embodied specificity to clear the 7-band, but not the visceral cost or flaw-driven mistake that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s yearning for “the shape of home” is anchored in concrete sensory memory (feather) and drives the entire arc; the interior contradiction—needing to remember yet fearing pain—lives on the page. However, her choices remain largely receptive (touching stone, letting symbols appear) rather than irreversible; the final “step forward” is symbolic, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The buried-talent motif is voiced, not dramatized through risky action. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent, and the emotional progression feels irrational yet credible.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s guilt and self-forgiveness motive stay coherent; the chess-piece fidgeting gives tactile specificity and recurs at closure. Interiority, however, leans on abstract labels (“weight of unspoken histories,” “storm within her”) rather than contradictory bodily impulses in-scene. No second character appears, so status/relationship pressure is absent; the single-POV arc works but the self-pardon feels lightly earned—thread-pulling in tapestry parallels more than personal cost. Micro-choices are visible (tracing tapestry, entering labyrinth, pulling thread) yet stakes lack a tangible forfeiture that would foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s “innocently mischievous” label is announced, not dramatized; the interiority is lyric, not contradictory. The closing renunciation (“I am the shattered mirror…”) is earned, but the emotional cost is stated rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual lens is consistent, and the micro-choice to keep reciting under growing spire-light shows hierarchy of values. Hairline slip: diagnostic self-label at climax keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s terror of losing her memories is embodied in trembling hands, rapid breaths, the tight clutch of the charm—never diagnosed. The contradictory wish to both mend and accept brokenness fuels every micro-choice (aligning charm to statue, risking the tilting floor). Interiority stays concrete—‘between breaths held underwater’ is a visceral clock, not an abstraction. Final stance crystallizes with earned cost: she stays aboard a dying rig because the reconstructed self can no longer live untethered.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “intimately aloof” is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices until the final reveal. The promise-to-self motive is clear, yet the emotional cost is only softly implied in the last line, not embodied in a visible forfeiture. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene; the arc is smooth acceptance rather than pressured trade-off. Voice is consistent, but the character’s flaws never complicate the action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s “inexplicable pull” is stated but never dramatized as contradictory impulse; the cork test and beach following are single-track, not pressured. The interiority slips into therapeutic summary (“he understood…power in subtlety”) without embodied cost. The final stance is declared, not earned by visible trade-off; silence=strength never confronts an alternative that would cost him. Motivation stays label-level; no micro-choice tightens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s grief-anchored drive is declared (“navigate the geography of loss”) but never embodied in contradictory impulse or tactile cost; she scavenges and welds without interior friction, and the arrival of refugees merely repeats the same beat. The censer foot dictates glow, not Mara’s values, so her final “sense of purpose” reads as retrospective label rather than earned renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s rational truffle-hunter persona is cleanly embodied in sensory, soil-level action; his “quiet smile” finish shows micro-change with cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the single forced-truth beat (“I don’t want to keep this…”) is slightly under-cooked—no contradictory impulse in scene, just surprise—so the flaw complicating later choice is told more than dramatized. Psychological-safety motive stays visible, drives every beat, and the renunciation lands as credible endurance with felt relief.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quietly obsessive need to “decode” the stranger’s gift gives every beat direction; the boutonnière is handled repeatedly and ties directly to the final acceptance of guardianship. Interiority stays concrete (“he closed his eyes, letting the memory…wash over him”) and his micro-choice to kneel, touch the print, then claim the journal visibly escalates commitment. No contradiction under pressure; flaw is the absence of any second character to create status tension, but solo POV is coherent. Closure renunciation—he will keep memories that aren’t his—pays an earned cost framed by prior因果.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s loneliness is asserted rather than dramatized; the only embodied moment is his hand on the wall. The interiority—“his own life felt devoid of direction”—is diagnostic label-speak, not a contradictory impulse acted in scene. The “empirically intuitive” trait enables discovery but never complicates or costs him anything on the page. The final choice to follow the shifting map is causal, yet the emotional price is merely implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    The queen’s interiority is mostly lyrical summary (“her gaze fixed,” “she felt a softly commanding pull”) rather than embodied contradiction; her single on-page micro-choice—vowing to restore balance—arrives in the last paragraph without prior dramatized tension or visible cost, so the turn feels announced, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to “capture the density of presence” is embodied in tactile ritual (humming, shell-handling) and escalates to a visible stake—she risks the friendship bond in real time. Interiority stays concrete: calloused palms, spiral grooves catching light, her voice “steady yet tinged with urgency.” Kael functions as living pressure: his widening eyes and touch on the shell force her to test the method in front of a witness, not merely in private theory. The final smile carries the felt cost: the experiment succeeds but the moment is now unrepeatable, an irreversible crystallization that satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands on the birch scroll, the weight of feral nostalgia in her veins—but the “getting jealous of past selves” mechanism is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. The final shift from envy to gratitude is cleanly motivated by the mid-air dialogue, so the arc earns its change, yet the cost feels more conceptual than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s anosmia-driven attention to silent detail is dramatized through micro-choices—handling the screw, listening to fog-drip, renouncing smell-centered nostalgia—and the final renunciation of regaining scent is refused with quiet cost, earning her “trembling calm.” Interiority stays concrete and sensorily displaced; no diagnostic shorthand. Relationship pressure with Mira is light but sufficient to force Elara’s confession of shared fragility, shifting both women’s stance. Only flaw: Mira’s grandmother remains off-page, so secondary-character pressure is implied rather than staged, capping the score just below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s desire to “transform scars into stories” is concrete and embodied through the quill-triggered crystallization beat. Interiority stays specific—heartbeat as metronome, trembling fingers—without slipping into therapy-speak. The micro-choice to revisit superstitions mid-crisis shows contradictory impulses (scholar vs. child) in-scene, earning the final calm. Cost is visible: quill smooths only after she accepts the fear, foreclosing the old coping loop.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-granddaughter contradiction is alive in her body (trembling bottle, breath-catching) and drives the micro-choice to channel the current; the apology-as-energy is a credible renunciation that costs her the weight of the bottle. Interiority slips once into “imperfect miracles” thesis-speak, but the embodied memory of soil-stained laughter keeps her from abstraction. Grandmother never appears as second character, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; reflection % stays within BRR limit because each recall cue tilts present stance. Loss of 0.2 for diagnostic tag “miracles aren’t perfect” delivered without immediate embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The witness’s interiority is lyrically textured (“wanderingly exact” as repeated perceptual signature), but contradictions never collide in-scene; choices are obediently abstract, so the promised cost feels conceptual rather than lived. No micro-choice visibly risks failure or loss; the dictionary floats away consequence-free, muting the arc from passive seer to active unifier.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsession with “what clocks really measure” is voiced early and drives every beat; the contradiction between mechanical precision and existential hunger is kept alive in his body (calloused hands, squinting, trembling parchment). The micro-choice to kneel, notice the notch, and risk the hidden slot crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible does not apply. The final renunciation of mere measurement for lived “spaces between” carries visible cost—his whistle now signals a personal, not institutional, dawn—earning Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s spatial gift is asserted but never exercised; the “physics of letting go” is told twice yet never dramatized as an internal contradiction. The offered mushroom is accepted without visible cost or prior micro-choice, so the final stance feels gifted rather than earned. Interiority drifts into thematic label-speak (“she understood something her father had tried to teach her”) at the exact beat where embodied conflict is required.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s grief and curiosity are vivid, but her decisions remain internal; the notebook write-out is the first concrete micro-choice and it lands too late to test her stated motive under pressure. Interiority is rich yet loops on abstract labels (“clover melancholy,” “theoretically rebellious”) without embodied contradiction in scene. The filial stake is clear, but the story withholds any external test or sacrifice that would foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s cultivated estrangement is stated early and embodied in his refusal to engage callers; the moment he blows the disc and accepts connection is a clear renunciation with felt cost (“his fingers trembling”). Interiority is mostly concrete, though “his heart quickened” edges toward cliché. The phone voices remain faceless, so relationship/status bullets do not apply; Eli’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. longing) are shown in micro-actions—disc slipping, breath steadying—earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s longing for “the cure for loneliness” is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a concrete, scene-level contradiction; the moon-rock talisman is handled twice yet never alters her micro-choices or risks. The climactic insight—connection is created, not found—arrives as thematic paraphrase rather than a dramatized cost. Interiority leans on diagnostic labels (“depth of longing,” “weight of suffering”) instead of specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. No visible forfeiture or irreversible choice charges the ending; laughter turns “genuine” without showing what is relinquished to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—blind yet mapping—stays vivid in embodied beats like “fingers danced over parchment.” The final renunciation (compass needle still, she carries the stillpoint within) is earned and forecloses external quest. No secondary character means relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices (kneeling, letting silence wash) reveal value hierarchy. Cost is felt: her maps shift from land to heart, a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “confidently uncertain” paradox is lived in the moment of writing on void-air; the pen warms in her palm, forcing a visible micro-choice. Interiority stays sensorial (“vibrated through her bones”) rather than diagnostic. The final renunciation—pen cold, anomaly reduced to ripple—carries cost, but her flaws (curiosity, hubris) are sketched more than probed; still, the beat-to-beat linkage is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at one emotional register; the “whispering advisor” label is never tested against another will so her charisma is asserted, not dramatized. The camera-click beat supplies a micro-choice that finally externalizes her gift, yet the absence of any living interlocutor keeps status and contradiction hypothetical. Motivation is clear and consistent; still, no tangible flaw or cost complicates her triumph, so the arc feels affirmed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The arsonist’s “volcanic tenderness” is a compelling contradiction, but interiority stays at label level (“analytically intuitive mind,” “singular motivation”) rather than dramatized thought. No contradictory impulse is shown in scene; the figure moves unruffled from clue to clue. The tear at the scroll is the only embodied emotion, arriving late and unearned. Because the promise costs the protagonist nothing visible, the arc feels observed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    Character interiority is poetic but floats in generalized lyricism; “auroral sorrow,” “shared dream” are abstract labels that never concretize as contradictory impulses. Fingers-drum tic is the lone embodied beat, repeated to saturation without escalating cost or revealing new hierarchy of values. Final pivot from victim to weaver is declared, not dramatized—no micro-choice on the page forecloses the old stance. Motive remains atmospheric rather than causal under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eli’s gait-reading gift is stated, not dramatized; we never “see” it parse a stride under pressure. The interior contradiction—wanting to prove subtlety yet fearing loneliness—is announced, not embodied. Micro-choice at the lock moment is present but thin; the cost (risk of collapse) is atmospheric, not personal. Mira’s desperation shifts her walk, but Eli’s counter-shift isn’t legible in muscle or breath.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian’s silence is used as an active instrument: shutter-weaving and mirror-tilt reframe the stranger’s self-perception without a spoken word, embodying the “teach darkness stars” motive. Interiority is minimal yet consistent—stillness as practiced discipline, not vacancy. The stranger’s change is credibly sourced in these micro-interventions, not therapy-speak. Cost is present: the guardian’s labor leaves them alone again, a cyclical service that forecloses personal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias’s “hear unspoken words” gift is asserted, never dramatized with cost or contradiction; interiority drifts into abstraction (“forests of second thoughts”) without embodied stakes. The chess-coach identity is ornamental—no chess detail informs tactics or metaphor. Motivation stays static; no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values. Closure is a scenic wide shot, not a paid-for renunciation, so change feels un-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—“guarded heart she couldn’t name”—rather than dramatized contradiction. The scrimshaw triggers action, yet her decision to row out feels more dream-logic than earned renunciation; no micro-choice visibly forfeits an earthly stake. Dock-worker grace is asserted, not weaponized under pressure. Closure lands as mood, not visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-versus-survival contradiction is embodied in the micro-gesture of whittling while blank-faced; the dried bouquet as brother-proxy gives every beat a concrete cue. Interiority stays specific (“the knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation—carving a heart she can never display—earns its cost through the earlier brother-loss anecdote. Still, the performance mask itself is told more than dramatized; we never see her almost slip in public, so the “morally ambiguous” trait feels asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s interiority is lyrically specific—“a tremor of certainty ripple through them”—but we never learn why art must transcend, what boundary cost they personally face, or what forfeiture occurs when the ice re-freeze leaves them “breathless.” The arc is one-note awe; no contradictory impulse complicates the choice to recite, so the change feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s color-blind painter identity is concrete—his palette of “grays and whites” and his tactile plant-code anchor an embodied, character-specific lens. The “innocently cunning” trait surfaces once (fern-note barter) but isn’t tested under pressure; we’re told it works, not shown it risking or costing him. Interiority is vivid (“warmth of sunlight on glass”) yet stays single-note; no contradictory impulse complicates his ascent to acceptance. Closure is credible—he chooses essence over color—but the lack of a visible price (lost barter, broken reed, social rupture) keeps the arc in the strong-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; she listens, reflects, labels, but makes no costly micro-choice that risks failure. The only shift—an abstract “sense of purpose”—arrives as summary after the fact, not as an embodied decision that forecloses an option. No contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her arc, so the ending’s “renewal” feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is sensuous—tracing the stencil, smelling phantom blooms—yet her grief never hardens into contradictory micro-choices that cost her anything; the tattoo moment is receptive, not decisive. The “seed” pendant arrives too late to test her hierarchy of values on the page, so the arc feels like gentle acceptance rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” trait is shown through her obsessive card-and-data mapping, but the interior contradictions that would lift her into high-band remain summary. Mira appears only to deliver exposition; her exhaustion is declared, not embodied, so the relationship never becomes a crucible. The final smile and “patterns can be reversed” line lands as tidy epiphany rather than costed renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her breath catching, fingers tracing bronze—but the “anguished joy” motive is stated more than dramatized; the pagoda turns her into a passive receptor rather than an agent who pays an on-page cost. The final realization that “past is gift” feels abstract, not a renunciation that forecloses a path. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; single-POV depth is good but not exceptional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her dusk fixation and talismanic stone ground her—but the climactic “luminous regret” is named, not embodied, and the renunciation (leaving the stone) lacks a preceding micro-choice that shows cost. Still, her obsession drives every beat, and the final stance crystallizes under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“sense of vulnerability she had never known”) rather than embodied contradiction; the tail-tip talisman reweights meaning, yet no micro-choice on the page actually risks or forfeits anything, so the renunciation feels asserted, not dramatized. Emotional labels outnumber visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “closure-seeker” drive is declared early and reiterated, but her moment-to-moment choices are largely reactive—following ivy whispers, accepting tunnel visions—so agency feels guided rather than earned. The interiority is atmospheric (“mind buzzing with fragments”) rather than contradictory in scene, and the climax is a surrender rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Micro-choices (picking up the mug, descending) are present but too low-stakes to dramatize a value hierarchy; thus the emotional cost is felt only at the lyric level, not through character-tested flaw or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interior life is textured—her skepticism about the label “crystal gazer,” her tactile ritual with the railing—but her decision to carry the strip away is announced rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulse in the moment, so the cost is inferred, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—“shadowed rapture” is embodied, not labeled—but her contradictory impulses remain summary (“gift—or curse”) rather than dramatized in-scene; the astrolabe trembles yet never forces a micro-choice with visible cost. The ending’s “mixture of fear and exhilaration” is felt, yet the refusal/renunciation is only implied rest, not a legible, priced stance. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric, enough for a strong if not fully incisive portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mara’s interiority stays abstract (“felt important,” “strange pull”) without embodied contradiction; the decisive moment—offering the clock—reads as instinctive rather than earned by prior visible flaw or want. No micro-choice under pressure shows a value hierarchy; the archive’s revival feels gifted, not wrested. The dreamless trait is label-only, never dramatized as perceptual limit or cost. Closure reaches Charged Poise, but character cost is ambient, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eamon’s interior contradiction—thirst for insight vs. disorientation—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice under pressure until the socket insertion. The gear-slot moment crystallizes his role, but prior wandering reads as label-driven “philosopher” rather than specific hunger altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s “unused courage” motive is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulse; she drifts rather than chooses. The ferryman’s youthful double is announced without prior internal logic, so his second appearance feels conjured, not earned. Interiority relies on abstract labels—“the leash had broken,” “she was free”—instead of embodied cost. The result is a protagonist who registers as symbol rather than person.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s mute endurance and final piano choice crystallize a believable arc from passive watcher to active keeper of truth. Interiority is sparse but embodied: trembling fingers, bolt heavy in pocket, hesitant notes. The “cost of safety” motive remains abstract—never pressured by an on-scene test—so the shift to hope feels more declared than earned. Still, the micro-choice to play lands as a visible renunciation of silence, satisfying the 9- gate for contradictory impulse in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s “diminutive titan” contradiction is asserted but never embodied—no moment shows scale surprise or limits altering tactics. Interiority drifts into synopsis (“her heart quickened”) instead of contradictory impulses under live pressure. The final “write your truth” command is clean but arrives without prior micro-choices that foreclose paths; pellet drop is symbolic, not a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tapping ritual and reef grief feel lived-in—but the atlas page arrives as pure externality; she never actively chooses to interrogate it, only “begins to assemble fragments.” The epiphany is therefore narrated rather than earned by a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The “why paths disappear” motive stays abstract; no contradictory impulse (e.g., fear of learning complicity) is dramatized under pressure. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to keep characterization in the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity and awkward confidence are vividly embodied—she pads through rust and starlight, opera glasses in hand—but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“awkward confidence transform into something steadier”) rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The grandmother backstory is used once for texture, never tested against present choice, so the interior arc feels foregone, not earned. Opera glasses work as charged heirloom, but no micro-choice shows her risking or forfeiting anything with them; the stone circle supplies the decisive jolt, not her own friction. Result: a luminous persona whose final resolve is more announced than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s insurgent-grandmother identity is stated, but we see only one micro-choice—pressing the embryo to the kite. The rest is summary of her history and intent. Interiority is generic (“her mind humming,” “heart lighter”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the decisive act is not preceded by visible stakes or a competing impulse, the change feels declared, not dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is visceral—her fingers “tracing the creases as if they held answers” embodies grief in motion—but the drone-strike backstory is delivered in two chunked info-drops that stall present pressure. The micro-choice to crawl for the photo is credible, yet the shift from freeze to artistic renewal feels telescoped; we leap from survival reflex to sketchbook without witnessing the intermediate contradiction that would make the renunciation costly. Still, her body-under-stress notes ring true and the final sketch is a believable reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s descent from paralysis to self-willed ascent is legible and embodied; the trembling hands, the trace of the cracked Tower, the decision to carry the cards loose all show interior contradiction in scene. The “luminescent ache” motif borders on diagnostic shorthand, but it is repeatedly tethered to concrete gesture, earning its keep. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned renunciation of the broken box is scaled to flash length and carries visible cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s loss-driven mission is visceral and embodied (“anger…burned deep within her”). The final micro-choice—accepting the ink as mirror, not eraser—carries cost (“tears welled”), but the interior contradiction is stated rather than enacted in-scene; her stance shifts without a visible intermediate struggle that would push her into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s interiority is present but generic; “bravely conflicted” is repeatedly asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The decision to copy the data feels inevitable, not driven by a visible flaw or compounded mistake. No embodied emotion under sub-zero conditions; breath-visible is reused thrice without fresh sensory twist. The arc is a single slide from hesitation to action without intermediate beats that force her values to collide.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s pacifism is anchored in embodied micro-choices (refusing to draw the blade, soil-touching ritual) and her father-shadow grants credible internal tension; the final acceptance of the sheathed blade is a renunciation that costs her absolute pacifist identity, visible in the closing smile. Kael stays a functional accessory, so relationship-as-crucible is thin, and the “senselessly perceptive” trait is named but never tested by contradiction or cost. Still, her hierarchy of values (plants > violence) is legible every beat, and the earned stasis lands.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s calm-fisher veneer is credibly maintained, but his interiority stays on a single register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the “cool-headed” trait never wobbles or costs him anything. The final “listen” choice is less a renunciation than a polite agreement; no path is foreclosed, no price is felt. Thus the arc is smooth but shallow, missing the hair-line flaw that would make the calm heroic or tragic.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s curiosity and guilt are sketched efficiently, but “orchestrated” micro-choices are missing; the investigation is told rather than shown under pressure, so contradictory impulses never clash in-scene. The climactic recalibration reads symbolic, yet causally abrupt—no visible cost paid on-page. Heir status remains ornamental; it never complicates tactics or risk. Hence the arc is present but not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt and her need to quiet the firmware are cleanly dramatized through the act of writing letters-as-child; the micro-choice to forge those replies is concrete, costly, and irreversible. Interiority stays embodied (“hands no longer steady but free”) rather than diagnostic. The contradiction between self-punishing isolation and the therapeutic outreach she denies herself is present but could be sharpened earlier; still, the final renunciation carries visible cost and is earned by prior causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, poetic, and consistent with her whimsical, socially-attuned persona; embodied emotion (“lilac unease in her chest”) and micro-choices (inserting flake, whispering question) show contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance—enduring the hush—earns its cost via prior grotto-story revelation, satisfying Earned Stasis. Flaws: chalk-artist skill never alters tactics; no secondary character to test status; competence slightly outweighs visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motives are declared (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) but never tested against an opposing force; the only micro-choice is rearranging tesserae, which carries no visible cost or risk. Interiority drifts into thesis language—“mercy should not be a rarity”—rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive flashes supply memory, not conflicting impulse; she never hesitates, refuses, or loses anything. The result is a coherent stance but not a crucible that reweights her values.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—spectral endurance vs. the need to intervene—surface in the embodied gesture of offering the coin; the cost is the emotional bleed of absorbing the woman’s despair. Interiority is concrete (“synesthetic currents,” “petals unfurling like secrets”) and tied to action. The micro-choice to hand over the coin reweights both selves, earning a credible renunciation of solitary stasis. Yet the second “version” of Mara remains a near-mirror rather than a fully individuated antagonist, trimming the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is textured—her body registers geode-coolness, static, dawn-light—as motive. Yet the arc is purely interior; no external test forces her to act, so “affectionate skeptic” remains asserted, not tried under fire. The cost is abstract (fatigue, hope) rather than a forfeiture we witness. Still, voice-specific perception keeps her individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing stone, the fossil “warm to the touch”—but the arc is an observer’s journey: she registers wonder rather than fights contradictory impulses. The decisive moment (placing the fossil) is externally triggered by floating, not by a micro-choice that costs her something we watch her weigh. The “voice of the unknown” motive is announced, not dramatized under pressure; we never see her refuse an easier path. Competence is high, struggle low, so the reconfiguration feels bestowed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority is sensory and embodied (“hands trembling slightly,” “surge of connection”), but the contradiction engine never fully ignites; she catalogues buttons and listens to voices without a moment where two equally live options tear her. The final “quiet inspiration” is asserted rather than dramatized via micro-choice, so the renunciation cost is felt only faintly. Still, her occupation-specific attention to preserved moments gives her a distinct perceptual signature that lifts the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scars, pillbox, snow codes anchor contradictory impulses—but “unused courage waits” is stated four separate times, flattening micro-choice into label-speak. The letter in the tree crystallizes the arc, yet the pillbox beat never physically constrains a choice; its weight remains emotional shorthand. Motivation is internally consistent, but the causal pay-off between pillbox and final stance is implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Coachman’s motive is stated but never pressured; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice tests his resolve. Yarn needle remains emblem, never weapon or sacrifice; interiority drifts into prompt-echo (“distill complexity into essence”) rather than embodied stakes. Closure is pure acceptance, no cost visible on page—he simply listens, nods, drives on.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—curiosity laced with self-interrogation—surfaces in micro-choices (she tracks sun patterns even when they expose her own inward harshness). The glass thrums louder each time her intention flickers, so the “kindness” test is dramatized, not asserted. Her pivot from self-study to communal teaching is the earned renunciation that forecloses solitude; the cost is the visible drain of clay dust on her hands as the oasis greens. No competence overreach; her flawed focus on objects over people remains legible to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” bent is shown through her gentle tending of unlikely plants, but her interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“beauty could thrive even in the most unlikely places”) rather than moment-specific contradiction. The lockmaster arrives as gentle mirror, not pressure source, so her final gesture of surrendering the tooth costs her nothing we can feel; the stance never tightens. Dialogue converges to the same soft register, flattening voice distinction. Still, her tactile gardening micro-moves and pocketed tooth give enough embodied specificity to stay above mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s interiority is atmospheric but leans on abstract labels (“brittle determination,” “sense that she was meant for more”) rather than embodied contradiction. The core shift—from scholar to embodied conduit—arrives as visionary download rather than a micro-choice she actively hazards under pressure; cost is declared, not dramatized. Her lineage and solitude are vivid, yet the orb-hand beat summarizes transformation instead of staging a charged, resistible decision. Voice remains consistent and particular, enough to satisfy the 9- gate for character-driven lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“the silences between words,” “thread that connected all things”—and her renunciation of the talisman at the end costs her something felt. The sole slack is that the whim trait is announced (“inevitably whimsical nature”) rather than shown complicating a choice; still, her steady perceptual filter and final hush of surrender read earned.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “tracing constellations,” her gaze “hardening”—and her micro-choice to weaponize the subwoofer grows from established competence. Yet the “cosmic tricksters” remain an abstract foil; their motives never press her blind spots, so the endured cost feels intellectual rather than personal. Still, the refusal to block (amplify) the signal crystallizes a believable stance and forecloses sponsorship salvation with visible fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are shown in concrete micro-choices—hesitating at the narrow passage, steadying herself with the compass—so her final embrace of “mutiny” feels earned. The father-loss motive is efficiently cued and transmuted into the compass-whisper without overt backstory dump. Interiority stays embodied, never drifts into therapeutic self-labeling. The only limit: secondary pressures (father, city, relic myth) stay off-stage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A; still, the single-POV contradiction pulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s face-blindness and methodical temperament are vividly dramatized—her grip on the lancing tool, the deliberate charcoal strokes—yet the quarry encounter remains a single, low-interaction beat; the figure’s anonymity is accepted too easily, muting visible flaw-driven error and cost. Interior contradiction is strong (“shield” of blindness vs need to see), but the moment of potential mistake (misreading the silhouette) is skipped, so the final stance feels more confirmed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “idealistic map librarian” trait is shown through her cataloguing mindset and the map etched into the floor, but her interiority drifts toward generic awe (“heart quickened,” “spongey dread”) rather than profession-specific perception. The copper nail functions as a charged heirloom, but its emotional link to her great-uncle is told more than embodied. The final renunciation lands cleanly—she forfeits the nail’s power—yet the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Still, the single-POV interiority stays coherent and the ancestral motive drives every beat, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Bridge-Song’s curiosity is clear, but interiority stays generic—“luminous disbelief,” “renewed determination”—without embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values; the fiddle is lifted once, passively. The ending gesture (raise fiddle, play) is unmotivated by any fresh cost or loss, so the arc feels like label-only growth.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “polished calm” is shown through quiet bodily detail—cross-legged sitting, steady voice—that contrasts with the scavenger’s jittery presence, giving credible interiority. Yet the trait never complicates or costs him; he never risks losing that calm, so the arc stays flat. The father-legacy motive is cleanly anchored in the foreign bills, but Elias’s final “understanding” is asserted, not dramatized through a visible choice. Still, the perceptual filter is consistent and particular enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority is lyrically voiced but abstract; “she sought not just knowledge but a way to heal the fractured memories of her past” tells motive before we see it tested. The only embodied contradiction is trembling fingers at the telescope; no micro-choice risks failure or exposes flaw under pressure. The decisive internal shift (she can now carry her own burdens) is declared rather than dramatized with a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eira’s interiority is vivid—her storm of guilt over the failed barrier anchors every step into the vortex. The contradictory impulses (guard vs. confess) act simultaneously; the “I failed” whisper is the earned hinge. Cost is felt: her cloak is tugged, her boots sink, her warlike serenity cracks—embodied, not labeled. One micro-slip: “warlike serenity” is repeated rather than re-seen under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“roots…tingled,” “heart raced with anxious elation”—and her micro-choices (kneel, clutch, step) track with motive. Yet the “visionary” trait is asserted, not dramatized; she never tests a wrong intuition or pays a visible cost for seeing too much. The scars glow, but the link between past wounds and present risk is told, not shown under pressure. Still, a single, coherent focalizer with embodied emotion earns solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “idealism” stays thematic; only one micro-choice—planting the sapling—shows risk, and it’s swallowed by summary. Her dusky-steady voice is vivid, but interiority leans on abstract labels (“weight of it all”) instead of body. The Earned Stasis lands because she repeats the choice aloud, yet the causal path that proves she could leave is never sketched, so the cost feels asserted not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—nostalgia for noise vs. shelter in data—are dramatized in tactile beats (scrap pressed to glass). Interiority avoids label-speak; the shift from factual shield to pocketed hope is earned by prior causal imagery. One micro-choice (fold/place) crystallizes values under pressure. Minor: no secondary character to act as crucible, but single-POV exception holds.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eliara’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile seed-planting and steady scholarship, but interiority drifts into generic “haunted ambitions” labels; the mentor-spirit absence is told, not embodied, so the void never complicates her micro-choices on stage. The final peace is asserted rather than tested by a visible renunciation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s curiosity and reflexive cataloguing read through tactile micro-choices (dipping hand, creel, orb) rather than label-speak; motivation stays fixed yet deepens. Interior contradiction—accepting instability to salvage wonder—remains implicit; the “process not thing” realization feels observed rather than wrung from her under pressure. No visible cost to her own identity or body tempers the arc; the ledger closes too easily, muting earned weight. Voice stays consistent, but secondary pressure or relationship crucible absent, so complexity plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—“the pearl felt warm, almost alive”—and her micro-choice to follow the tug rather than finish the inspection shows contradiction under pressure. The flaw: her shift from “inspector” to “bridge” is asserted more than dramatized; we see no concrete fallout from abandoning the timed mission. Still, the embodied awe and final weight of the crown give her a credible, if lightly costed, renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical map-making vs. raw emotional reckoning—are dramatized in the accordion-note moment and the final self-map; the interior cost of stopping meds is embodied, not labeled. The “raw solace” is credibly earned: she does not forgive herself, but the map’s weight literally shifts in her hands, foreclosing retreat. Minor slip: the old acquaintance’s dialogue gifts her the thematic line rather than forcing her to wrest it from the graffiti herself, slightly blunting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is lyric but generic—“cautious exuberance,” “fear and hope”—never particularized through bodily contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. She remains a receptive vessel for symbols (watch, humming shelves) rather than an agent whose flaws or hierarchies of value force costly trade-offs. The blank-watch warmth and the quill-automatic writing are magical givens; they reveal no internal limits or blind spots that complicate her path. Closure is a beatific smile, not an earned renunciation, so the arc feels bestowed, not bled for.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her “mulberry ache” gives a visceral signature—and her micro-choice to play the violin seeds the climax. Yet the telepathy trait is asserted, not dramatized: we never see a plant’s message complicate or cost her a decision, so the gift feels decorative. The final renunciation (opaque violin, silent plants) lands as Earned Stasis, but the emotional price is named rather than shown in body or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s single desire—“to capture one last spark before oblivion”—is declared early and never complicates; interiority stays at a luminous distance, giving no contradictory impulse under pressure. The traveler’s sudden appearance supplies the only micro-turn, yet Elara’s shift from “capture sparks” to “embrace stillness” is gifted rather than earned through visible mis-steps or cost. Her hands tremble once, but body and tool use remain ritualistically gentle, flattening embodied tension. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized: we are told she feels “newfound understanding,” but no prior flaw or obsession is foreclosed with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is sketched with gentle strokes—“kindly decisive” is asserted, not dramatized—but we never see a moment where kindness and decisiveness collide. Interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“a quiet unrest lingered… a yearning she couldn’t name”) instead of embodied contradiction. Her single micro-choice—stepping into the lake—arrives without prior tactical pressure, so the visible cost is missing; the forgiveness that supposedly drives her remains off-page backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “conscience for hire” premise intrigues but stays abstract; no client on scene means no status crucible, so his interiority must carry the beat. The mirrored shard micro-choice—pocketing it for the letter—neatly externalizes his intent, yet Mara remains off-page, so the emotional cost is projected, not shared. Still, his perceptual filter is consistent and the final renunciation (handing over the shard) is credibly earned. Voice stays steady, never lapses into therapeutic self-diagnosis, and the lone figure choreography is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “backwards aging” premise is asserted rather than lived in micro-choices. No embodied contradiction or tactile cost is dramatized—she throws stones and murmurs maxims, but we never feel her cells rewinding. The withheld-truth conflict is declared, not enacted under pressure; the moment she decides to speak, the scene summarises rather than shows the stakes on her body or voice. Earned stasis is gestured at, not viscerally paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is lyrically specific—‘weathered by time and resolve’ hands, silent recitation of ancient verses—yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps interior conflict conceptual rather than enacted. The final renunciation (stillness over motion) is foreshadowed by the canyon’s echo logic and the arrowhead’s compass reveal, so the cost feels legible but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s “underachieving mage” label is stated, not dramatized—he succeeds on the first real test, so the flaw never complicates choice. Interiority drifts into prompt-speak (“solace in the forgotten art…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The closing epiphany is gentle but feels pre-ordained; no visible cost forecloses a path, so the arc lands as affirmation, not Earned Stasis. Still, his tactile handling of the harness and the mist-walk micro-choice show brief flashes of idiosyncratic agency.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyric but thin; the “meteor hush” longing never becomes a concrete contradiction in scene. His single micro-choice—descending the hatch—alignes with established drift, yet no bodily cost or conflicting impulse is dramatized. The final vow feels serene rather than charged because prior beats lack visible trade-off. Voice remains consistent, but emotional embodiment stays in soft-focus.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interiority is evocative—“quietly enthusiastic” governs her micro-gestures—but the text keeps telling us she is “determined” rather than enacting new contradiction once distillation begins; the coins carry memory yet never force a trade-off that visibly costs her. The final beat lands as affirmation, not renunciation, so the emotional price feels announced, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s grief is palpable in embodied beats (hand on railing, touch dissolving crystal), but interiority drifts into label-speak (“her heartbreak had not been in vain”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The micro-choice to name each monster crystallizes her shift, yet the prior causal link between lost mortal and present ritual is asserted, not dramatized, softening the cost. Still, her occupation as reaper is more than costume: the scythe’s neglect and reclaimed purpose visibly externalize arc. Earned stasis lands because the final resolve carries the weight of the performed naming.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliard’s earnest naiveté is shown through concrete micro-choices—scrubbing rust, humming droplet rhythms—yet the interiority slides into gentle summary (“he wondered if his efforts would be enough”). A visible cost is present (the scar-crack), but the cosmic imbalance remains atmospheric rather than dramatized as internal contradiction under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet resolve and “precisely humane” vocation ground every step; his decision to stage the exhibit is a visible micro-choice that costs him solitude. Interiority stays concrete—boots sinking, glass cool against palm—never drifting into label-speak. The flaw: no contradictory impulse is shown in scene; he moves from guardian to curator without friction or self-doubt on the page, so the change feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s harmonizing drive is declared early and remembered but never made to bite; her “secretly sentimental” trait is named twice yet never complicates a choice or costs her anything on the page. The crystal moment is pure affirmation rather than crucible. No contradiction is dramatized; interiority drifts into generic wonder-language (“surge of warmth”) instead of specific, costly micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seeker’s interiority is memorably atmospheric—muscle-memory flash of the buckle, fingertip brush—but stays at a single, emblematic register; contradictory impulses are announced (“inventive nature clashed with responsibility”) rather than enacted in a visible micro-choice. The character’s arc is a smooth ascent-triumph-descent, so no genuine flaw or mistake compounds under pressure; the watcher’s burden functions as lyrical label, not as a limit that once forecloses an option. Closure is a validation, not a renunciation or costly endurance, so the cost feels symbolic rather than lived. Voice texture is strong enough to feel individual, yet the emotional palette never complicates beyond awed resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses are dramatized in the sword-duel with the brain; the embodied rush of fear/joy feels earned. Interiority slips into label-speak (“vivify their own spirit”) but recovers with micro-choices (trembling hands, decisive shatter). Cost is visible: the jar shards and the emotional flood qualify as earned stasis. Flaw: duplicate-consciousness logic is asserted, not lived; brain’s voice never complicates Kael’s interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s curiosity and creative drive are credibly sketched, but the interiority stays at a generalized “puzzle-solver” register; we never feel a private contradiction or visceral fear. The final step into the chamber is decisive yet cost-free—no visible stakes or flaw-induced mistake foreclosed—so the arc flirts with tidy competence rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eli’s mournful eagerness is embodied in every pull of the cord and cracked note; the leaf-blower-as-conductor conceit stays particular to him, not generic. Internal contradiction is present—he knows the task impossible yet keeps pulling—but the “household” he wants to heal never materializes on-stage, so the emotional cost is projected outward rather than enfleshed. Still, his micro-choices (warming handle, fluid steps, final release) track a credible arc of exhaustion-to-hope. The flaw is off-page stakes; the strength is embodied, non-label interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs. homesick ache—are dramatized in her body (pendant grip, coiled stance) and crystallize in the renunciation that keeps both realms in peril; the cost is felt. Interiority slips once into “dimensionally homesick” label-speak, but recovers with sensorial cold seeping into pores. Secondary figure (keeper) supplies status pressure that forces her public refusal, tightening the crucible. Endurance earns credible stasis: she will stand sentinel between worlds, ache unhealed.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—stoic armor vs. raw sensitivity—surface only in summary; the text names them rather than dramatizing their friction under pressure. The pivot from despair to defiant creator is declared, not shown through micro-choices that cost her anything on the page. “Stoically sensitive” remains a label attached to静止 posture rather than a visible trade-off that narrows her options. Without embodied tension in the critical beats, the arc reads as thematic assertion, not lived change.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction—“a strange sense of peace,” “she understood”—without embodied contradiction. The only micro-choice we watch is dial-twisting that re-ignites the shard; the prior false assumption about finite power is told, not dramatized through visible cost or risk. No second character means status crucible is off the table; the arc lands as a tidy epiphany rather than a renunciation with palpable forfeiture. Voice is consistent, but emotional layering thins under lyric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s “resiliently positive” trait is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory action; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible emotional price, so the interiority stays flat. The moment she hands the hourglass to the transient should crystallize a value hierarchy, yet it reads as courteous plot setup rather than sacrifice. Because no flaw or internal conflict complicates her choice to enter the rift, the earned-change test fails and the closure feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood memory surfaces as a sensory echo that physically tilts her weaving—but the “texture of connection” remains an abstract want. Her single decisive act (resuming the weave after the shadow-man’s warning) is credible, yet the felt cost is muted: we see thread tangled, not psyche frayed. The flaw is micro—therapeutic self-label (“she knew she had changed”)—but it lands in the closure beat, nudging down from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s shift from routine teacher to symbolic leader feels plausible, anchored in her tactile bond with the anchor chain. Interiority is mostly concrete (“fingers brushing,” “grip tightened”) and her refusal to mothball the towers is a credible renunciation with social cost. Yet the emotional contradiction is more declared (“understood the fear… but knew fear was a poor compass”) than dramatized in body or voice; the final beat offers quiet resolve rather than a palpable internal wound. Still, within word count, the earned stance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembled,” “breath catching”), but her “curiosity” is asserted more than dramatized in contradiction; the final nod of acceptance is credible yet the cost feels abstract rather than corporeal. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible unused; micro-choices (picking up aid, pressing it to ear, nodding) are present but don’t foreclose a path with felt bodily price. Motivation to “protect vulnerable voices” is declared; it guides action but never collides with a counter-incentive that would sharpen flaw or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s fear of enclosure is shown through tactile beats—tightened grip, ragged breath—but the interior contradiction never loops back to complicate her vault choice; the liminal vision of Voss supplies emotional payoff yet lands as external gift rather than wrested change. The final calm is asserted more than embodied, so the cost feels implied rather than viscerally paid. Still, her flaws steer every spatial decision, keeping her recognizably individual.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting as embodied anxiety, the shard as tactile memory—but contradiction is only asserted (“a survivor of an error, hers but not hers”) without dramatized competing impulses. Micro-choices stay at keyboard-level; no visible cost or path foreclosed on the page. Renunciation/change is implied, not enacted. Earned Stasis not quite achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s embodied copper-veins and quiet articulation are shown through trembling hands, soft murmurs, and final collapse; her interiority stays concrete (“she focused on them, using their movements to guide her”). The cost—physical collapse and faded veins—pays for the earned endurance of saving the language, satisfying Earned Stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the single POV keeps interiority stable, but the lack of visible flaw-driven mistake keeps this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her obsession, grief, and sudden laughter are embodied in breath and pulse. The “cosmic joke” motive crystallizes when she laughs in the alcove, renouncing control with felt cost. No second character on-page, so status dynamics N/A; her micro-choice to laugh rather than seize power is a credible, irreversible stance shift. Motivation stays legible and intensifies to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand on the shell, the heartbeat sync—and her renunciation of safety for orchard-revival carries visible cost. The “gap between knowing and understanding” is lived, not labelled. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his trembling hands, the bottle’s cool glass against his palm—and every beat of the smuggling run is filtered through the contradictory pull of hope and survivor-guilt. The “quiet defiance” is shown in micro-choices (slipping between scanner beams, landing the drone under truce flag) rather than told; the moment he turns away from the handshake “his satchel still half-full” crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. One slip: “fix what’s broken” flirts with thematic label-speak in flashback, −0.3, but the embodied present-tense pressure quickly recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The carpenter’s muteness is handled as texture rather than label, and the “interior contradiction” quick test is met when he pockets the fragment against his own rule of silence. Yet the final restoration beat is slightly too omniscient—his exact emotional micro-choice at the carousel apex is paraphrased (“heart full”) rather than embodied, so the cost feels generic. The halo acts as external catalyst, not flaw-driven mistake; hence the arc is poignant but not fully complicating.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “sanely eccentric” label is asserted, not embodied; her rearranging books is the only micro-choice, and it carries no visible cost or contradiction. The scarf warms but never forces a trade-off, so the final “guardian” stance feels bestowed rather than earned. Interiority stays generic (“heart pounding,” “surge of warmth”) and never fractures under pressure. For 700 words we need at least one irreversible, costly micro-decision; the piece gives none.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's longing is embodied in tactile ritual (pre-dawn trek, palette-camera marriage) and culminates in a credible renunciation—she accepts the lost dream will stay lost, pays with surrender of the original quest. Interiority stays concrete, but the “cipher of longing” drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis twice (“haunted her like a cipher,” “cipher… began to unravel”) without embodied cost on those exact lines, preventing full 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—remains abstract; the story tells us the vault secret “could save or destroy the world” but never dramatizes what the idea is, so her final release carries no felt cost or contradiction. Interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“weight of untold mysteries”) rather than specific, embodied stakes. The mother-hair glows and orients, yet Elara’s micro-choices inside the vault are reduced to a single, unchallenged “I release you,” flattening internal conflict. Earned change is asserted, not dramatized; the orb shatters but her stance is unchanged, so the arc lands as declaration, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on the mushrooms, the tremor in her hands—but the “chronically curious” trait is stated more than dramatized; we see only one micro-choice (digging) and no contradictory impulse in-scene. The locket photo lands as a sharp reweighting of identity, yet the cost of recovered memory is asserted, not embodied; she breathes, she feels “shift,” but no lasting constraint is shown. A stronger contradiction or forfeiture in the final beat would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—‘fingers trembled’, ‘breath shallow’—and her backward-walk tic is embodied early. The mentoring motive, however, is asserted rather than dramatized: no mentee appears, so the crucible is missing. The tea-leaf method shows micro-choice under pressure, but the climactic ‘quiet resolve’ feels unearned because no prior flaw or mistake is confronted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s wish to “preserve the color of wonder” is declared repeatedly but never tested by an opposing force; she performs the ritual exactly as planned, so no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is dramatized. The only micro-choice—planting the seed—is indistinguishable from her inherited vocation, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal. No internal tension escalates; competence stays untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s grief and vocation are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions—“lucid unrest,” “accumulated silence”—that short-circuit contradictory impulse. The final beat of self-mending is signaled, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that visibly costs her anything in the moment the last knot gives. Earned Stasis is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” nature are shown through tactile beats (fingering grooves, frame-by-frame video scrubbing) rather than told. Contradictory impulses surface once: scholarly hunger vs. protectively skeptical restraint, but the beat is brief and not revisited under rising pressure. The final descent into the chapel lands as earned renunciation of surface certainty, paid for by days of literal digging; the cost is visible, quiet, and scaled to word count. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; single-POV voice stays coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is rendered in one specific action after another—tracing the snow-globe glass, turning pages, placing the globe down—so interiority stays concrete. The quietly analytic trait is shown through cataloguing, pausing at ink blots, following the map; it is not merely labeled. Motivation (“physics of letting go”) is visible in how she treats artifacts: she neither hoards them nor flinches from decay, and the final renunciation of the globe costs her something we have watched her covet. The absence of a second on-page character limits relationship pressure, and the single epiphanic paragraph edges toward summary, but the final gesture still carries a palpable forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically voiced—“driftingly alert” is a lovely idiosyncrasy—but her decisions are reported rather than dramatized (“she realized,” “she began to encode”) so we witness no contradictory impulses under live pressure. The bolt-plate handling is abstract; we’re told it feels like a key rather than seeing her fingers mis-thread a gear or risk a short that would force adaptation. Ghost-contact is summarized, not embodied, so the climactic hand-clasp lacks a visible cost on her body or future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist versus mystic—surfaces early and drives her leap, but the epiphany that “the sky is a memorial” is stated rather than dramatized with bodily cost. The mentor’s telescope functions as an emotional anchor across beats, yet her final choice reads as serene acceptance rather than a renunciation that visibly forecloses a future path. Slight emotional over-tidiness at closure keeps this just below the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her face-blindness and fractal perception filter every observation, never told, always shown through tactile detail. The single contradiction—seeking an unnamed “something” yet executing a flawless plan—remains unexamined, blunting potential depth. No second character means relationships/status bullets are waived; the obsession is credible but static, so the arc is more confirmation than transformation. The earned cost is the building’s collapse, felt externally; her internal limit stays untested, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—finger on the dog-ear, breath catching, notebook clutched—yet her internal contradiction (isolation vs need for connection) is only stated, never dramatized. The final beat of “smiled, isolation melting” is declared, not earned; no visible cost attaches to her decision to follow the beam. Still, micro-choices (tracing symbols, muttering Latin, trembling hands) track a believable arc from observer to actor.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s want to “learn the rhythm of repair” is stated early and re-appears in the final line, but interiority stays generic (“heart pounded,” “hands trembled”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure; the hall-of-mirrors epiphany is summarized rather than shown forcing a micro-choice with cost. The earned stasis moment feels lightly grazed, not paid for by a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s shift from restless orchard hand to bell-ringer is legible, but the interior cost is abstract (“restless” tells; we never feel the ache). Elara’s ghostly agency is atmospheric, yet her final fade is foregone, not a renunciation that stings. Secondary cast remain functions—Mira=larvae, Jorin=clapper, Lira=song—so relationship pressure is zero. Still, the collective micro-choices do accumulate to one visible ritual, satisfying short-form scale.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered and tied to the puppet, but her contradictory impulses stay abstract (“doubt crept in” vs. “renewed determination”) without embodied micro-choice that alters tactics; the blood-offering is the single visible cost yet reads ritual rather than character-specific. No relationship crucible or status shift on page, so the arc is solitary and mostly symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s interior contradictions (duty vs. hatred of isolation) are voiced early and embodied when she palms the nut; her sprint-into-alcove save shows genuine risk. Yet her “reluctant caretaker” angle is told more than tested—no on-page moment where she almost abandons the traveler or the orchard, so renunciation cost feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—polymer-chemist lens filters every beat (“molecular bonds,” “structural harmony”). Contradictory impulses (grief vs. lab refuge) collide in the chrysalis beat, embodied in her grip and river-crouch. Micro-choice of climbing out is earned; cost is visible in twilight breath. No secondary character on page, so status bullets N/A; occupation details shape perception and final bridge-metaphor, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mending others while seeking her own origin—surfaces early but never sharpens into a visible micro-choice under pressure. The climax (cutting the ledge) is rendered in cool summary, so the “felt cost” is only asserted. No contradictory bodily reaction or visible flaw manifests; the blank book merely receives moonlight without testing her. She reads as a serene plot agent rather than a person whose limits skew the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s gift is dramatized through tactile contact with coral walls that literally taste of regret; the embodied cost (tears, dissolving shard) makes her interior arc credible. Contradictory impulses—burden of others’ pain vs. her own need to heal—co-exist in the central chamber beat. Final renunciation (absorbing the heart-shard) forecloses her prior detachment with visible physical price. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is serviceable but leans on stock phrases (“her heart full”) and tidy emotional labels; the contradictory impulses needed for 9+ are asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. Her moment of private cost is displaced into group catharsis, so the renunciation/readiness beat feels second-hand. Still, her sung micro-choices do drive the gears and the crowd shift, keeping her north of functional.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “helix-minded” label is vivid but never dramatized in a contradictory choice; the memory-imprint act is reported rather than performed under stress, so the cost feels abstract. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she understood her purpose”) instead of embodied contradiction. The renunciation at the end is declared, not foreclosed by prior micro-choices, keeping the arc functional but not crucible-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“prism-minded” kept active through perceptual skips), but the only genuine choice—step into the pool—comes late and is unpunanced; still, the kinesthetic handling of manuscript and seed shows bodily stakes, and the latent-flaze motivation stays consistent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but keeps circling the same abstract note—”music in silence”—without contradictory impulse or visible flaw. The porcelain insulator moment almost forces a micro-choice, yet she merely “places it carefully,” no cost or risk. Her empathy is declared, not dramatized in contradiction; the only change is the sculpture’s surface, not her stance. No path is foreclosed; she ends serene, so the arc feels lightly ornamental rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alara’s exile-guilt-quest is cleanly triangulated: the basalt stone’s dent mirrors her own flaw, the knight-sacrifice literalizes her teaching ethic, and the king-topple crystallizes her refusal to return on old terms. Interiority (“silence is not strength but a cage”) is shown through embodied ritual—chess moves—rather than label-speak. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the final renunciation (return as guide, not subject) is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; a sharper sting would lift this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—pacifist yet obsessed with unlocking a militaristic clasp—never surfaces as lived tension; her “eccentric pacifism” is announced, not dramatized. The micro-choice to “whisper” to metal is evocative but solitary; no external pressure tests her credo, so the stance remains decorative. Embodied emotion is strong in the trembling fingers and warm presence, yet the diary’s opening costs her nothing and changes no relationship, blunting Earned Stasis. Voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s olfactory gift and ambition are established early, but the interior contradiction between drive and emptiness is narrated rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the climax’s tearful realization is credible yet leans on summary. No secondary character appears, so status dynamics are N/A. The earned shift from striving to surrender is legible, but the cost is more stated (“tears welled”) than embodied in a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s internal life is vivid—pulse of the arrow-tip syncs with heartbeat, body tilts with planetary inversion—yet her motivations stay anchored in pilot instinct and curiosity. Micro-choices (she steers, presses, steps) map cleanly to stakes, and the final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she remains to become guardian, forfeiting pilot mobility. The “planet’s whispers” line skirts diagnostic cliché but is rescued by immediate sensory reaction. No second character on page; therefore status & relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s investigative drive is vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“rapidly adapting mind”) rather than dramatized in a visible micro-choice; the patch moment is strong embodiment, yet final renunciation lacks a fresh beat—cost is felt but not acted upon in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is concrete—synesthetic seeing-sound is shown, not labelled—but the childhood vow is delivered as retrospective summary rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. Micro-choices (ringing bells, stepping back) align with motive, yet no visible flaw or doubt complicates the final act; success feels pure, cost-free. Earned stasis is present but lightly priced; still, the prism-song perceptual signature is vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s drive is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory micro-choices; the crystal-orb trauma is recounted rather than lived, so her risk-taking at the flute feels pre-announced. Interiority drifts into catalog adjectives (“her heart pounding,” “trembling hands”) that don’t sharpen under pressure. The final step into the new world is passive—music “guides her” rather than a conscious, costly decision—so no earned renunciation or visible flaw compounds. Competence outweighs struggle; the lens stays situational, yet stance crystallization is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s yearning to “bridge the gaps between people” is vivid, but the borrowed-personality trait stays ornamental; it never complicates or enables the halo experiment. Interiority is lyrically rendered yet drifts toward explanatory paraphrase (“it was as if…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climax—accepting overloaded empathy—rings true because the fragment has been tactile throughout, but the absence of a micro-choice that *costs* him something concrete (time, identity shard, a relationship) keeps the arc just short of earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s courier nerves and missing-mentor ache are shown through bodily cues (tightening satchel, visible breath) rather than labels, but the internal contradiction never sharpens into a micro-choice that costs her. The pendant’s “choice” does the decisive work; her agency is reactive, so the arc feels half-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—breath, chill, trembling hands—but the “deep sorrow” she decodes from the prism is relayed as an external fact rather than a contradiction she must metabolize. The moment she “understood that emotions absorbed by objects were not just data” is declared, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that costs her anything. Still, her perceptual filters (frost map, quartz hum) individuate her and sustain a credible mystic stance. The arc lands as earned stasis, but the price feels conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but thin; “wistful” is stated not shown, and her only micro-choice—stepping onto the light-bridge—lacks prior contradictory impulse. The bead’s glow tracks growth yet never forces a trade-off; sacrifice is asserted, not dramatized in body or deed. She remains a type rather than an individual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eli’s “quiet determination” is stated repeatedly but never embodied in contradiction or visible cost; every choice is smooth and unresisted. The stranger’s undefined otherworldliness undercuts the relationship-as-crucible beat, so the “barter” lands as abstract premise, not pressured trade. No micro-choice shows him weighing what “his awakening” actually costs; the interior monologue stays safely summary.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is vivid (“she clutched the shard tighter, its glow intensifying as if responding to her frustration”) and motive is clear, but Elara never faces a hard choice that costs her anything; the orb simply reveals destiny. The “weight” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s reticence is shown through quiet action, not told, and his “warmly observant” eyes anchor interiority. Yet his final resolve feels slightly abstract—no concrete flaw or contradiction is tested under pressure, so the cost reads as thematic rather than personal. The turn from passive curiosity to active guardianship is legible but not viscerally earned. Still, the characterization stays consistent, voice-specific, and avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Herald’s interiority is lyrically voiced, but the only embodied cost is a hand warming on the wick; the pivotal choice to open the gateway is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-moves, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s “quietly explosive” mind is shown only in generic interiority; the gift of feeling others’ stories is declared, never enacted through contradictory embodied reaction. His micro-choice—offering the wing—comes late and alters nothing on-page; the woman’s decision to speak is unmotivated by any visible pressure from him. No cost attaches to his new awareness; closure leaves him unchanged, so the arc is decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s quiet custodian persona is consistent, but interiority stays safely general (“felt a pull,” “smiled”) rather than exposing contradiction under pressure; micro-choices (handling sextant, descending) exist yet never force a visible trade-off or cost, so the ending’s beatitude feels assumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “scattered memory keeper” remains a label rather than a lived contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure—she drifts from discovery to discovery without staking anything. The final song arrives as felt epiphany, not earned via prior tactical failures. Emotional embodiment hovers at surface; body is mostly “hands tremble” cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s empathy is concretely shown (she smooths the fragile invitation), but her “recluse” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the decision to stop hiding is declared, not pressured by a visible on-page cost. The micro-choice hierarchy is hinted at but never forces a sacrificial trade-off. Interiority stays specific except for one “enlarged tranquility” label near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers brushing the loaf, the tang of sourdough—but “find the sacred in the ordinary” is stated more than dramatized. The plaque line is an external echo of her motive rather than a pressure-tested choice. Still, her gardening micro-choices (digging, planting lavender) embody the trait and earn the quiet ending. Cost is present—exhaustion, fragile peace—but the absolution stays abstract, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s gently meticulous nature is shown through tactile care (gloved hands, velvet casing) and later weaponized when urgency collides with habit; the inscription’s shift reweights her task from routine to legacy, earning a renunciation of pure order. Interior contradiction is light—no moment of genuine self-doubt on the page—so the arc feels singular rather than wrestled. Still, the embodied trait directly enables the closure image (steady hands carrying light), meeting the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lila’s interiority is serviceable—her vow to “capture the sound of trust breaking” is a vivid, character-specific motive—but the story never lets us feel the moment that sound actually registers; instead, she simply declares the truce “frayed” at dawn. Her micro-choices (refusing the flask, challenging the necklace man) align with her steadfast label yet stay rhetorical: no embodied fear, no sensory cost, no visible mistake. The heirloom pivots from clue to talisman without altering her tactics; she ends where she began—guardian of hush—so no path is foreclosed. The flaw is emotional summarization in peak beats, not contradiction, hence the mid-6 hold.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Luminous skepticism is asserted rather than dramatized; Elara’s only micro-choice is to keep walking after the ring tingles. No contradictory impulse is acted upon in-scene, so the trait feels decorative. Interiority defaults to stock phrases (“mind raced,” “turmoil within”). Closure accepts the call without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—charcoal-stained fingers, trembling hand, mnemonic overload—but the epiphany that should pivot her from fear to action is delivered by a note she once wrote to herself, a deus-ex-memento that short-circuits earned transformation. The “wild-eyed” self-portrait functions more as prop than as credible mirror of prior repression; we are told, not shown, the buried passion. Micro-choices under pressure (smearing pigment, placing the broken lock) are present yet feel symbolic rather than tactical; the final painting is declared liberation rather than experienced struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s candor-tied gift is anchored in tangible craft, her trembling hands and wilting leaves dramatize contradiction under pressure; the moment she absorbs the lovers’ betrayal her leaves brown, embodying cost. Motivation stays crisp—truth as possible oasis-restoration—driving each descent and inscription. Interiority is concrete, no label-speak; flaw (fragile honesty) complicates tactics and forecloses social safety. The final choice to etch and broadcast the bitter truth earns its hope via prior causality, paying visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“seasonally mute” becomes a lived silence—but her contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final walk-off is graceful yet costs nothing we can touch. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path; the iceberg sculpting is ritual, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s caretaker-nostalgia is shown in tactile petal-touching, but the “inner static” is declared in abstract diagnostics rather than lived contradiction; her final detachment is visible, yet the turn feels mild because we never see her memories actually fray under pressure. Micro-choices (hovering hand, glowing protocol) do chart a hierarchy of values, but the emotional cost is more summarized than embodied. Still, a recognizable before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clara’s “knack for uncovering stories” is asserted rather than shown; the only concrete micro-choice—inserting the locket key—comes gift-wrapped by Mrs. Ellis and carries no visible cost. Interiority drifts into therapeutic gloss (“this felt personal”) instead of embodied contradiction. The ending renunciation (reading the letter aloud) is gentle but not driven by any prior wound or flaw, so the arc feels pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s calm-defiance signature pulses through embodied beats—fingers brushing damp walls, dice warming in her palm—each micro-choice tightening her resolve. The interior contradiction between fragility and encryption crystallizes in the dance where she “encrypts vulnerability as strength” on-page. Closure carries earned cost: the lab awakened, she now bears guardianship with no exit shown. A hairline slip: “lyrical code breaker” is told once, never re-shown via diction or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s yearning for lost memories is concrete and embodied—his fingers keep returning to the wildflowers—but the story never lets us see him make a true micro-choice under pressure; the “exhume” beat is entirely internal and passive, so the cost feels abstract rather than paid on his body. The wildflowers guide, but they don’t force a forked path; the chamber simply reveals, never tests. Interior contradiction is sketched, not dramatized. Earned stasis is gestured at, not visibly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically textured (“listening to the void between breaths”), but her contradictory impulses are only asserted, not dramatized; the final smoothing succeeds because the text says so, not because prior micro-choices visibly foreclose an alternative path. Earned cost is gestured at (“weight of her responsibility”) rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clara’s curiosity and inherited loneliness are sketched in sensory shorthand; her readiness to follow Elias feels more convenient than compelled. The seal-as-key is accepted without visible internal friction, so the beat where she “hardens her resolve” lands as label-only. Elias remains atmospheric shorthand—“man who teaches dead languages” never complicates that label with a visible stake or limitation. Interior contradiction is present but mild; the ending’s cost is implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s skepticism is asserted (“charmed skeptic”) rather than dramatized; she kneels and accepts the shell without visible interior resistance, so the promised contradiction never plays out in scene. The final shift to “independence” is declared, not shown through a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The micro-choices on the scroll—tracing, hesitating, erasing—are tangible under pressure, but the interiority slips into label-speak (“a master of calibrated treason,” “the pain still raw”) that tells rather than dramatizes. The contradictory impulse is present—erase versus forgive—but the epiphany leans therapeutic rather than embodied. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation is legible and carries felt cost, satisfying the 600-word closure bar.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s longing to understand “why some people echo” is clear, but the interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“reed-blown melancholy”) rather than concrete contradiction. She makes only one micro-choice—kneeling at the pool—and even that is obedient rather than volitional. The seashell warms, but she never actively tests or misuses it; the cost is observational, not paid. Earned Stasis is gestured at but not dramatized with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—she “belongs to the shadows,” “heart quickened,” “whispered names.” One micro-choice: placing the globe on the altar. No contradictory impulses under pressure; reflection dominates over live scene. Closure is a tender renunciation, but the cost is poetic rather than felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—Elara’s “demure audacity” lives in her tactile handling of the whisk and the unintentional whistle. Yet no contradictory impulse is ever dramatized; she moves from observation to quiet affirmation without a visible cost or forfeited path. The net-mender craft stays metaphorical, never once constraining a mid-scene choice; the promised philosopher’s contradiction never complicates action. Closure is gentle stasis, not renunciation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “sharply observant” trait is repeatedly dramatized—she kneels to feel the tree’s hum, re-letters by firelight, and finally presses the diamond into the earth. Interiority stays concrete (“her sharply observant mind began to piece together…”) without label-speak. The renunciation—choosing containment over destruction—carries visible cost in her exhaustion and the orchard’s restored storms. Flaw: we never sense a contradictory impulse that might complicate her drive; the choice feels inevitable rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is sketched as “lonely visionary” but interiority drifts into generic cosmic awe (“gleamed with determination,” “heart pounding”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice shows him risking anything tangible until the final activation; prior “tireless deciphering” is summarized. The variant-allegiance fork is declared externally by radio voice, not wrestled with via visible dilemma or sensory cost. Closure earns a stoic smile, yet the price (sanity, relationships) is asserted, not dramatized on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical and consistent; his “positively wistful” nature is shown through tactile ritual (humming into jars) rather than label. The final shard-to-ear gesture crystallizes a credible renunciation—he forfeits perfect capture for living resonance—yet the causality between jammed gears and internal shift is lightly sketched, muting the cost’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied: the cool metal cue anchors every spike of dread, and her contradictory “logically emotional” split is dramatized in the moment she demands proof while already stepping toward surrender. The final refusal costs her the illusion of safety and is earned by the earlier tactile study of the key. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is once asserted rather than shown, but the embodied trembling palms compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—impatient cartographer who preaches patience—is dramatized only once, in her deliberate footfalls across the lake; otherwise the story summarizes her shift rather than forcing her to choose under pressure. The “sculpt patience from impatience” motive stays abstract; no micro-choice visibly costs her a concrete alternative, so the renunciation feels inferred, not earned. Secondary visitors arrive as a faceless influx, offering no status tension to sharpen her stance. Still, her perceptual signature—mapping gaze, lunar rhythm—remains distinct and consistent, keeping the portrait above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is serviceably concrete—her fingers trace the journal, her pulse quickens—but “fortified vulnerability” is asserted more than dramatized. The mentor is never on-stage, so the emotional crucible is one-sided; we see her decide to break free, yet the cost is declared (“she felt free”) rather than paid in a beat we witness. Still, micro-choices (angling the lantern, prying the wall, steadying her hand) align with her occupational lens and keep her from sliding into stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt for doubting Thomas vs. need to act—surface in micro-gestures (folded hands, finger-brush on boxes). The apology-to-action motive scales credibly; silence about Thomas’s actual guilt keeps ambiguity on the page. Cost is visible in the final image: heart ticking in his palms = burden transferred, path chosen. Interiority avoids label-speak, though “vibrant hush” flirts with abstraction once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her calloused hands, bloodshot eyes, arrow-tip talisman clutched at the end—but the “steadily curious” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The single on-page decision (ring the bell) is telegraphed rather than wrestled-with; we see no contradictory impulse in scene. Cost is present (the bell’s call empties the sea), yet it feels visited upon her, not paid by a crucible choice. Still, the occupation-specific tinkering and tactile object use keep her from slipping into stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “brightly attentive” trait earns its keep: it surfaces in micro-choices (spotting the 7-multiples, decoding the song, lying to her boss) and feeds the final, costly decision to risk exposure. Interiority stays concrete—headset-adjust, eye-scan rhythms—never slipping into diagnostic labels. The only soft spot is the climactic leap from “coordinates” to “they were taken,” a cognitive jump that feels slightly under-cued by prior choices, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative (“shadow-laced,” “pulse of the world”) but stays performative; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The mirrors expose fears, yet agency is reactive—she watches, then places the fragment. A credible renunciation lands, but the cost is asserted (“shift within her”), not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—witnessing endings yet clinging to the parasol—drives every beat; her micro-choices (tightening grip, staying to listen) embody the “loose grip” trait with visible cost. The moment she lifts the parasol to the aurora, renouncing voyeuristic grief for present participation, is earned by the man’s whispered question and her shaken response. No stock labels; even “euthanasia tourist” is redefined through action. Flaw complicates arc: she almost flees, then stays, paying with her prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s gently-persuasive trait and sentinel role anchor her, but the interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she realized…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The burned letter fragment works as a tactile object, yet its emotional charge is told more than dramatized. The final shift—embracing mismatch rather than perfect alignment—feels credible, but the cost is stated, not shown through a micro-choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured (“strangely honest heart” drives the consecration micro-choice) and the mask/line-walker identity seeds contradiction, yet the beat sequence is mostly ritual enactment rather than a pressured fork with visible cost; the prophet’s arrival is external confirmation, not a crucible that forces her to gamble or renounce. No secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship dynamics and status shifts are absent by scope. The consecration glow is the sole embodied moment; thereafter emotion is stated (“ached,” “solace”) not shown under escalation. Earned stasis is claimed but the price feels off-page—she walks away lighter than the ritual weight implies.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s calm-archivist persona is vivid and embodied early—her fingers “brushing petals” while arranging photos—but the “lost someone” backstory arrives as a single expository lump, muting interior contradiction. No choice she makes on-scene meaningfully narrows her options; the sequencing of photos feels pre-ordained rather than a pressured decision with visible cost. The arc lands in gentle uplift (“heart lighter”) without renunciation or stake foreclosure, so the emotional progression is more therapeutic than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s scholarly reticence and obsession with the crystal are credibly drawn, but his interiority leans on thematic summary (“deep respect for the power of language”) rather than embodied contradiction. We see only one micro-choice—accepting the crystal’s energy drain—so the promised “hierarchy of values under pressure” is asserted, not dramatized. The final renunciation lands because earlier beats foreshadow the cost, yet the emotional texture is slightly monotone; his silence never cracks into revealing new information or risk. Acceptable, but not yet crucible-hot.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is vividly embodied—he marks the ground with chalk because he cannot trust his next step—and the final release of the chalk feels earned, but the interiority sometimes drifts into abstract paraphrase (“tidal longing that pulled him forward”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. The “sound of growing older” remains a lyrical label without a sensory footprint that contradicts or complicates his desire. Still, the solitary micro-choices (kneeling, dipping chalk, placing driftwood) track a believable hierarchy of values: memory < momentary anchor. Cap lifted because closure hinges on his renunciation of the tool; cost is quiet but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior motive—"to harness the ephemeral"—is declared early and recurs, but the only embodied contradiction is the luminous ache; we never see her genuinely doubt or fear the loss she wants to arrest. The micro-choice to dismantle rather than repair the clock is on-page and stakes her identity as “repairer,” giving the arc a credible cost. Still, the camera-repairer vocation is invoked as label only; no camera or customer appears, so the trade never pressures her. The renunciation earns its resonance because the spinning hand slows under her new device, showing endurance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s serene-decisive kindness is asserted but never tripped by contradiction; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible price, so the trait feels like a label rather than a lived tension. Interiority floats in generic therapy-speak (“her heart full”) instead of embodied, character-specific sensation. Micro-choices—calling Claire, picking the vinyl—are smooth but uncontested, so no value hierarchy is forced. Closure is gentle but costless; the goodbye succeeds exactly as planned, so nothing is foreclosed and the character arc is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s quiet deliberation is shown through meticulous rune etching and the patient dawn vigil at the isle’s lip; the key’s growing glow externalizes her interior progress. Missing is a moment where her flaw or blind-spot visibly jacks up cost—she succeeds too smoothly, so the final beat feels earned but not painfully paid.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“heart pounding,” “bones being reset”), but contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized; the renunciation of the stone is smooth yet not visibly costly. The changeling-guilt motive is named, not embodied, so the final stride feels therapeutic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to give light while fearing fire—remains embodied in the tactile ritual of polishing; the moment she lifts the glowing glass, we see the earned cost of that vow on her scarred hands. Yet the “pearl of stillness” functions more as lyrical label than crucible: no alternate path is ever risked, so the final stance feels like confirmation rather than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “quietly proactive” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (tending, rearranging, documenting) that externalize her need to graft meaning onto old wounds; the amber pendant functions as both shield and tether, its warmth grounding her contradictory impulses on the page. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final shared silence with Kai reads as Earned Stasis: vulnerability is no longer solitary but co-witnessed, foreclosing isolation at visible emotional cost. Secondary pressure from Kai is gentle yet present; his notebook reprises her icicle obsession, proving mutual witnessing without collapsing into rescue fantasy. Voice distinction is minimal—both speak in same softened register—but internal hierarchy of values is legible: beauty > safety > exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the shell, the ache in her throat—but the “conflicted novelist” premise is asserted more than dramatized; no actual writing or renunciation occurs on-page, so the promised flaw/choice arc is only summarized. The cameo stories arrive as external data, not internal crucible, so the contradiction is observed, not enacted. Earned stasis is implied, but the cost is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s longing to revive forgotten songs is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“heart swelled with hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly risks failure after the first hum; the vine’s cooperation feels inevitable. The moment she decides to keep singing is summarized, not dramatized with cost. Earned stasis arrives, yet the price is only implied by the glowing orbs.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—translate heartbeats into maps—never meets a concrete test; no heartbeat is listened to, no map materialises, so the want stays abstract. Her “unwavering patience” is asserted repeatedly but never pitted against a real temptation to hurry, so the trait flattens to label. The interiority is lyrically voiced (“heartbeat quickened…hands remained steady”) yet never contradicts itself, producing no live internal friction. Because no micro-choice visibly costs her anything, the closure qualifies as ornamental rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “wanting to store wonder for dull days” is dramatized in the quiet moment when he cups invisible echoes—an embodied micro-choice that costs him sleep and companionship. Interiority stays particular to a tinkerer: angles, gears, peripheral glints. The arc is endurance rather than swing; the renunciation of normal time is implicit, but the text hedges on the cellar’s price, shaving the top.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—her grip on the lamp biting into palm, the calcified soul-layers—yet the “fractal weaver” label stays mostly ornamental until the final self-weaving beat; a stronger mid-scene contradiction between collector duty and self-preservation would have pushed her into the 9 band. The renunciation lands with cost, but the figure’s temptation never truly tests her hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s grief-driven motive is vivid; her carving micro-choices (tracing, pausing, sipping) embody contradictory impulses without resorting to therapy-speak. The final renunciation—accepting impermanence by finishing the lion—carries visible cost, but the interiority drifts into thematic echo (“here and gone” restatement) near the close, muting the full sting of earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s regret and her “negotiation with her own ghost” are viscerally embodied in the static crackle of the camera wheel; the contradictory impulses—cling to fragments vs. step forward—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final micro-choice (standing, wheel in hand) is causally keyed to the voiced plea, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority occasionally drifts toward therapeutic self-tagging (“regret clung like a second skin”), keeping the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eli’s curiosity and engineer lens are cleanly signaled, but interior contradiction is asserted (“he sought to puzzle out new equations for hope”) rather than dramatized in scene. The sextant piece triggers no micro-choice that costs him anything; the resurrecting actions are smooth but emotionally flat, so the final “equation” feels intellectual rather than earned. No conflicting impulse under pressure is shown; the arc is a single upward gradient. Fits functional band but not the 8.8+ gate for visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty-bound caretaker vs. buried traveler—surfaces in embodied micro-moments (trembling fingers on damp crystal, breath catching at “bear”). The final act of completing the blank clock is a credible renunciation that forecloses escape yet charges the sanctuary with new meaning, paying visible cost in her tender smile. Still, the dream’s abandonment is more recounted than dramatized; we are told the longing “had never truly left” rather than seeing it sabotage a present choice, keeping empathy slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her pulse-linked sundial, the ache in her chest while reading the captain’s confession—yet the “architecture of lies” motive stays abstract; we never see one specific lie she means to dismantle. The salvaging micro-choices are present and legible, but the final uplift feels slightly under-costed: she stands “tall,” journal in hand, without an on-page forfeiture or newly closed path. Voice remains coherent and individual; the contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs. fear of what it costs) are hinted but not crystallized in a single pressured moment. Still, the embodied emotion and tool-attention lift this above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “infinitely patient” trait is dramatized through tactile knot-work and humming fulgurite, not label; interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulses onstage—risk-free patience flattens urgency. The final smile is earned but the cost is atmospheric, not personal; we see no path foreclosed. Seed-collector vocation seeds theme yet never shapes tactics; rope decoding could belong to any obsessive academic.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral-within-spiral knot decoded reweights prior material, confirmed by “ancient methods were safe.” Causal lens holds: each knot advance follows tactile probing; fog and glass serve as textured mirrors, not coincidences. Orientation anchored by sentence three; no set-up debt. Cost is collective, not protagonist-specific; still, the world-in-breath-hush makes cultural loss felt.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
    <comment>Golden dock under snow is sensory, selective, and filters through Elara’s artifact-attuned gaze. Snow-muffled planks and lightning-born glass constrain movement and echo pattern-seeking. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single static location. Environment does not physically alter tactics; micro-setting charges final image but lacks causal squeeze—caps entry below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The traveler's quiet witnessing feels lived-in; her decision to gift the notebook is a micro-choice that crystallizes her ethos. The widow's tearful offering of her own carpet thread shows a credible shift from frozen waiting to acknowledgment. Both characters remain in emotional surplus: we see contradictory impulses (hope vs. recognition of loss) acted out in real time. The only bar to 9-band is that the widow's turn is slightly smoothed by the traveler's near-perfect attunement—no visible misstep complicates the intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is declared early and never contradicted, but interiority stays generic: “his heart quaked,” “surge of hope mixed with dread.” No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the final insight that “beauty could not be forced” is narrated rather than embodied through a micro-choice that costs him something visible. The egg is cradled, not risked; the machine is assembled without hesitation or trade-off, so the renunciation feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—arsonist’s seed vs. firefighter self—remains abstract; the “spark of compassion” is declared, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her. The graft act is tactile, but its emotional ante (reject village scorn? risk failure openly?) is never sharpened so the turn feels symbolic rather than personally hazardous.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly particular (“luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed faintly”), and her micro-choices (sketching geese, pocketing the shard, slotting the final mirror-piece) track a believable arc from detached curiosity to participatory liberator. The flaw of intellectual arrogance is shown, not told, and the endurance cost—accepting her own trapped memories—lands as Earned Stasis. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, and the single-POV default is fully met, so the characterization never rises to the top decile.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority drifts between lyric abstraction and therapeutic self-exposition (“otherworldly sentimentalist” is label-only; no embodied contradiction surfaces). The gear-touch beats are passive meditation, not micro-choices that foreclose paths; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Earned stasis is hinted but the refusal/fire renunciation never shows up as a live fork on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—chisel-in-hand, breath-syncing with greenhouse hum—and her contradiction (wanting to “carve grief” yet fearing its impossibility) stays live. However, the decisive shift to seeing grief as “migration” is confessed more than dramatized; the chisel never hesitates or slips, so the cost feels intellectual, not corporeal. Spectral mentor is effectively a second character whose status (dead, once-master) is clear and pressures her, but their dynamic is one-way echo rather than status shift. Still, the earned renunciation—stone becomes testament, not tomb—tracks to prior causality and carries quiet cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s ethical diligence is shown through ritualized action (winding, carving) rather than label; the childhood-flaw backstory is compressed yet anchors his present perfectionism. Interiority is concrete (“calloused hands,” “reverence born of routine”) and his micro-choice to carve new inscriptions dramatizes incremental absolution rather than stating it. The final image of himself-as-pendulum crystallizes a credible renunciation of heroic scale in favor of quiet service, paying visible cost in the shift from private duty to public conduit. Missing higher band: no contradictory impulse visibly fought mid-scene; the epiphany arrives more as graceful accumulation than as pressured dilemma with stakes visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s gentle curiosity is credibly embodied, but his interiority drifts into abstract labels—“a love so profound that it had outlived its origin”—without contradictory impulse or visible cost. The final stasis is only a quiet closure of the case; no path is foreclosed and no price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is evocative—trembling hands, remembered mentor line—but contradiction is only summarized (“not fear but possibility”) rather than enacted in a single beat. The final smile and weight-of-scroll gesture give embodied cost, yet the arc is still a tidy ascent: doubt → write → succeed. No micro-choice shows him tempted to abandon or misuse the quill; the feather writes itself, so agency is diluted.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clara’s interiority is thinly dramatized—her “surge of excitement” is label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The notebook grab is the sole micro-choice; it advances the beat but carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. No contradictory impulses run in scene; motivation stays at abstract desire level. Closure is a declared resolve, not an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-driven need to “crystallize a fleeting emotion” is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“mirage of safety,” “fragility”) rather than embodied contradiction; the ash-scattering choice is legible yet feels pre-decided, so the moment registers as ritual rather than costly renunciation. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the final poise carries earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael's contradictory drives—clinging to the cog while dreading the sewer—are embodied in tactile rituals (tracing, polishing) and micro-choices (hesitating, then following Lira). The final ascent earns its cost: he relinquisms isolation, but the story keeps the price abstract; we feel the loss of the sewer’s certainty more than any concrete forfeiture. Interiority avoids label-speak, though “abrasive calm” is asserted more than dramatized. Status dynamics with Lira are crisp: her mockery forces his defensive exposition, and their power tilts when she commands him to the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—braiding voices into harmony—stays legible, but her interiority leans on abstract labels (“expectantly resigned”) rather than embodied contradiction. The rosette acts as a tactile anchor, yet her only micro-choice is the decision to “subtract noise,” which is stated, not dramatized through stakes or visible trade-off. Students stay generic, so status/relationship pressure is absent. Closure works as Charged Poise (choir swells, silence replaced), but cost is collective, not personal; she pays no individual price, so the arc feels gentle rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—hope vs. doubt—are dramatized in real time as she plants, prunes, and tastes; the final choice to share the fruit is earned by her overnight labor and the visible cost of exhaustion. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic: “She knew planting it here… was risky.” Flaw (stubborn idealism) complicates action and remains unresolved, supplying credible cost. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness is stated, not dramatized; we never see her forced to blurt a costly truth. The “preserve wonder” motive is declared in exposition and never tested by a moment where lying would save her skin. Internal contradiction is missing: she never wrestles with wanting to lie but being unable. The final choice to “whisper the riddle” is gentle but not visibly costly—no one hears, nothing changes, so the arc feels under-punctured.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s “inadvertently profound” trait is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulse or visible cost; the sanctifying speech is the only micro-choice and it reads as rehearsed wisdom rather than pressured revelation. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“felt a difference”) instead of embodied contradiction, so the final stance feels assumed, not earned. No persistent flaw or price attaches to his new calling, keeping the arc thin.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s telepathic interiority is concrete and character-particular; the paradox of immobility forcing agency via thought is well-drawn. Elara’s motivation is legible—save the village—but her contradictory impulses (certainty vs. doubt) are stated more than dramatized in scene; the micro-choice to delay and retest is earned, yet the cost is told (“gratitude”) rather than embodied on-page. The interior conflict is present but not granted the same sensory immediacy as the setting, keeping it just shy of high-band integration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “grim optimist” interiority is textured through her dice-rolling micro-choices and the chipped-die loss that forces her to renounce retrieval; the contradiction is lived, not labelled. Emotion is embodied in scuffed boots, white knuckles, breath pacing—never abstracted. The final letting-go is earned because the prior beats have dramatized her obsessive clutch; the cost is the mentor’s die itself, gone forever. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted once rather than dramatized in a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is concrete—her insomnia is shown through nightly climbs, stool-sitting, pulse-checking brush. Contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. urgency) coexist in scene, but the “remember kindness” motive is stated more than dramatized; no micro-choice tests it under pressure. Endurance of dawn vigil carries faint cost (fatigue acknowledged) yet feels more aesthetic than crucible. Voice remains painter-specific; no head-count or status issues.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s desire to revive the bread-rite is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract “rescue dying arts” tag-lines; the lens-triggered whispers are accepted without on-page skepticism, muting credible struggle. The final distribution of bread shows communal change, yet her own micro-cost (loss of the lens? of authority?) is only gestured at, not felt. Still, her historically-minded gaze is consistently filtered through tactile dough and emerald light, giving the arc a coherent emotional spine.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s neatly inventive mind is shown through tactile dismantling of the yoyo and the counter-clockwise clocks he “had ever made,” grounding motivation in action; the flaw is that the final, irreversible choice (“no going back”) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible emotional cost—his trembling hands are the only embodied consequence, leaving the interior renunciation under-developed for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clara’s fear-of-oblivion motive is declared late and only once; prior behavior is exploratory rather than driven by that precise dread, so the final “unbosoming” feels more discovered than mined from prior micro-choices. Interiority is atmospheric (“her mind racing”) but avoids diagnostic-speak; embodied emotion is present yet leans on stock gestures (clutching clasp, trembling voice). The earned stasis lands because she names the fear aloud, but the causal trail is thin—no earlier beats show her avoiding visibility or memory projects—so motivation intensifies only at climax, not throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Leeward’s interiority is lyrically voiced but stays observational; he never makes a risky micro-choice that costs him anything. The “restlessness” is declared, not dramatized through bodily tension or tool handling. His final peace feels shipped in rather than earned by visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s quiet obsession and pattern-seer vocation are cleanly anchored; her mentor-loss motive is shown via the spiral shell rather than told. Interiority stays sparse but concrete (“her heart pounding” vs. diagnostic labels). The final choice—accepting the quest to find the first turtle’s heart—costs her the safety of ignorance and is foreshadowed by the mentor’s disappearance, so renunciation is earned. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count stays default-safe.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s historian identity is repeatedly labeled but never complicates her choices; the “emotionally rational” trait is asserted rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse appears under pressure, and the moment of insight in the archive is summarized, not embodied. The final “peace” is declared without visible cost foreclosing a path. Micro-choices are missing; she observes, then suddenly understands.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his boots sink, the inkwell clinks, raw hands throb—and the stoically-sensitive contradiction shows in his refusal to flee the stench of decay. Motivation stays anchored to the inherited inkwell ritual, but the shift from “surveyor” to “archeologist of dreams” is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him abandon a prior professional rule or pay a social cost for the trespass. The final lightness in his chest feels earned by the bodily ordeal, yet the stakes of that transformation stay internal and therefore moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s indexing logic is merely asserted (“logical page indexer”) rather than dramatized; her only cataloguing act is to realign a single map, so the occupational lens never alters tactics. The interiority is vivid (“dappled resolve”) but too distilled—no moment of contradictory impulse under pressure. The antique stamp is the true actor; her motivation is stable, so no visible cost attaches to her final choice. A stronger crucible would have forced her to stamp something that destroys her own prior index, making her profession hurt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s sorrow-into-lanterns reflex is concrete from line 1; the shift to unfolding origami is an embodied micro-choice that externalizes internal contradiction. Interiority stays specific (“his craft felt hollow”) rather than label-speak. The final stance crystallizes through the causal chain of folded-then-unfolded cranes, but the emotional plateau is slightly too smooth; a sharper cost in the basilica moment would have earned 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Zara’s loss and new purpose register, but interiority relies on template phrases (“a stark reminder,” “shattered world”) and diagnostic self-labeling (“unfiltered awakening”) that flattens embodied emotion. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; choices are either declarative or purely observational. The final stance is legible, yet it is declared rather than paid for through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s motives are clear—retrieve the chip fragments—but interiority is generic (“heart raced,” “mind racing”). The perpetually surprised trait is stated, never embodied; no contradiction or micro-choice shows it altering tactics. Closure’s “frequency of belonging” epiphany is told, not dramatized; cost is conceptual rather than felt. Character functions, yet lacks individuating detail or visible flaw that complicates action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s guilt is palpable in embodied detail (ticking watch, sand-sunk hand), but the interior contradiction never sharpens into an on-page choice that costs him something we can see; the “decision” to stop lying is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—antique pull as tactile anchor, moon-phase belief as worldview—but her “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is declared more than dramatized in micro-choice. General Kael’s stern loyalty is sketched by silhouette, not contradiction; his single nod feels concessionary rather than costly. The earned stasis lands, but only Elara pays visible price. Still, both actors stay consistent and the relationship crucible does shift status.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her legs “wobble,” she “traces” the brass—but the self-diagnostic “broken navigator” label is asserted, not dramatized. The emotional arc is visible: compass failure → pole-method → compass tucked away, yet the decisive shift is narrated rather than embodied in a moment of visible cost. We see no contradictory impulse in scene; instead, feelings are summarized as “fractured heart” and “weight of failure.” The renunciation earns partial credit because the kayak push-off is micro-embodied, but the lacked micro-choice under pressure caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—amnesiac self-erasure vs. the returning flickers of guilt—are dramatized in the moment he drops the ball: a clean micro-choice that externalizes inner split. Interiority avoids label-speak; “jaded wonder” is shown, not named. Memory fragments arrive as sensory shards, not exposition, so past clings without over-explicating. Cost is felt: the lake baptism commits him to carrying pain rather than deleting it—an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract (“gift had long been both her salvation and her curse”)—a stock binary rather than a body-felt contradiction. Embodied emotion is present yet catalogued (“shiver,” “fingers trembling”) without sensory idiosyncrasy. The final internal shift is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices; we are informed she feels “the weight of her past lift.” Relationship pressure is absent; guardian functions as oracle, not crucible, so no status swing tests her values.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.0)
    Interiority is rich—Elara’s motivations (nephew guilt, lost-time obsession) stay legible and consistent. Yet the emotional shifts—guilt → perplexity → tearful acceptance—are declared more than dramatized; we’re told “eyes filled with tears” rather than shown bodily friction under pressure. Single POV keeps choreography simple, but no second character means the “relationships as crucible” bullet is waived. The earned stasis (she will return with presence) lands, but the cost feels lightweight because the moment of choice is a gentle caress of a saucer, not a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s pacifism is shown through refusal of violence and reliance on compassion, but the interiority leans on label-speak (“her pacifist nature had once been seen as a weakness”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The single on-page decision—inserting Kwan Yin’s Tear into the core—alignes with motive, yet the cost is more metaphysical than felt; no tactile sacrifice or irreversible loss is dramatized. The emotional shift toward “ghostly resolve” is asserted, not performed, so the arc is visible but not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motive—"to understand the texture of transformation"—is stated early and re-articulated at the close, giving her arc a visible spine. Yet interiority drifts toward abstract self-labeling ("her heart remained rich with purpose") rather than moment-level contradiction; no bodily cost of poverty is felt underfoot. The micro-choice to release the bugs is earned, but the prior beats accumulate mostly observation, not pressured decision. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are present but soft; the final renunciation lands cleanly, keeping the score just under the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s “calmly inventive” trait is shown twice—decoding the sundial and coolly triggering the cradle—but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized mid-beat. The silent-revolution motive is declared early yet never collides with a visible personal cost; she never hesitates or loses anything on-page. Thorne’s sudden hesitancy is convenient rather than motivated by prior cues, so the relationship crucible remains inert. Competence dominates struggle, keeping the arc closer to clever puzzle-solving than to a felt renunciation or earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s precognitive curse is dramatized through ritualized micro-choices (rock placement, dust scatter) rather than label-speak; his interiority stays anchored to bodily tension and auroral shimmer. Interior contradiction is light—he fears yet craves clarity—but choices visibly foreclose the option to keep the sequence unchanged, paying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Flaws complicate rather than decorate: the same sight that guides him erodes certainty, shown when the pattern re-forms at the end. The ending “smile” is a shade tidy, trimming the full emotional cost of living inside eternal pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“furiously tranquil gaze”) and the final micro-choice—writing uncensored—pays the cost of shedding anonymity. Yet the contradiction between fleeing censorship and instantly embracing exposure is asserted, not dramatized; no intermediate beat shows the risk of speaking. The map-of-scars motivation is vivid but acts as external prompt rather than emergent flaw that compounds choices. Emotional arc is coherent but leans on epiphanic summary at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s mechanical arm is mentioned often but never affects a decision; interiority drifts into abstract “truth of questions” rather than embodied contradiction. Mara’s shift from defiance to curiosity is sketched, not dramatized—no micro-choice shows the cost of her softening. The closing “destination within” is asserted, not earned by prior causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically embodied—“coat patched with stories,” “pockets lined with verses”—and his dreamer-persona choice to paint poems on the library wall is a costly micro-act that forecloses vagrancy. The monthly molting trait is announced but never allowed to complicate present action or risk, so it stays ornamental. Clara’s quiet-steel voice is distinct, yet her grandfather’s letters function as external prompt rather than crucible; she doesn’t face a forced choice under pressure. Closure earns its charge because Elias’s renunciation of endless shedding is legible in the final rooftop beat, but the cost is more conceptual than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s grief is palpable in early image work, but her “strategically creative” trait is asserted, not dramatized; the pivot from passive mourning to active reel-hunt is announced rather than shown through micro-choice. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“steely longing”) that short-circuits contradiction under pressure. The earned shift—playing a “new song”—lands as symbol without prior tactical ingenuity visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara’s motivation—save the island’s memory before the monsoon—remains clear, but her interiority stays generic (“her heart steady,” “mind racing”) and never acquires a perceptual fingerprint. The single decisive choice—answering the riddle—restates theme rather than revealing new internal contradiction, so the promised cost is conceptual, not felt. No micro-choice under pressure shows a hierarchy of values; she simply articulates the moral. The audience learns her role, not her person.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s slow, deliberate interiority and gentle handling of compass/lace feel lived-in; the micro-choice to read each letter aloud is embodied. Yet the arc is almost passive—he drifts, follows, listens—so the renunciation of regret feels bestowed by setting rather than wrestled. No contradictory impulse collides with his urge to release, so the “earned” beat is soft. Interiority stays specific, but the lack of friction undercuts high-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to strip away needless drama—is credibly embodied in her quiet focus on decay and transformation, and her scientific background informs her observational rigor. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves steadily toward awe without resistance or doubt. The butterfly’s emergence feels more like a reward than a consequence of struggle, weakening the cost of her choices. Her humility is stated rather than dramatized through flawed action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a glass artist, and her steadily adaptive trait informs her actions. Interiority is concrete (“hands steady despite the chaos,” “mind piecing together fragments”), though emotional complexity leans slightly tidy. The final determination feels earned, but internal contradiction remains muted—more resilient than conflicted. Her micro-choices (tracing frost, following patterns) reveal values with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a musician turned silence-translator. Her interiority is embodied through tactile sensations (vibrations, warmth) and concrete tools rather than diagnostic labels. The presence of Kael adds relational pressure without diluting focus, and their silent expressiveness aligns with the story’s logic. However, her final realization borders on epiphanic without sufficient micro-choices showing active struggle in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s inadvertent stubbornness and weary professionalism feel consistent and embodied, especially in his tactile interaction with the book and lens. His motivation—to give rest a permanent address—emerges credibly from his vocation and drives tangible choices. However, his emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward unearned epiphany (“he knew he had found what he was searching for”) without sufficient micro-choices showing internal contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of weariness lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in intergenerational care, and her micro-choices—like stepping into moonlight instead of fleeing—reveal values under pressure. However, interior contradiction is muted; she experiences no discernible internal conflict, only resolve. The widow scene offers emotional embodiment, but Mara’s emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy that would deepen realism. Her “gently persistent” trait reads more as label than lived tension with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—finding unused love from a past life—is compelling and consistent, driving her pilgrimage with spiritual curiosity. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensations (trembling hands, slowed breath) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; her path is singular and unimpeded, reducing tension. The final renunciation of past guilt feels earned but arrives without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering lost ancestral memory through the texture of time—is compelling and consistent, driving every key choice. Her interiority is richly embodied (“hands trembled,” “quaking reverie”), and her emotional arc from longing to revelation feels earned. However, the transformation lacks a visible cost beyond the fragment’s dissolution; the maze’s deactivation reads more like resolution than sacrifice. The final shift in self-understanding is resonant but borders on epiphany without sufficient friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The liberator’s motivation—planting resilience—is clear and consistent, and their “patiently strategic” trait informs key actions like decoding the piano keys. However, interiority remains abstract (“eyes burned with purpose,” “mind was sharp”) without embodied contradiction or specific emotional texture under stress. The final renunciation of chains lacks a dramatized cost; their sudden disappearance feels unearned rather than symbolically resonant. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the protagonist’s emotional arc leans on assertion over micro-choices with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and sensory peculiarity, and her micro-choices—collecting absences, pressing palms to shipwrecks—are consistent with her goal. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile and synesthetic perception. The final renunciation feels earned: she doesn’t “fix” the breakage but integrates it. However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene—her struggle leans more toward poetic resolve than active conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation—seeking “illuminated moments” to hear destiny—is consistent and embodied in her hesitation, micro-choices (rearranging flowers), and final acceptance of the jar. Elara mirrors Lira’s yearning, deepening interiority through relational contrast. However, the transition from thief to seeker leans slightly on declarative phrasing (“a thief no longer, but a seeker”) rather than fully dramatized transformation, softening the cost of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her vulnerability, fear of judgment, and gradual embrace of imperfection feel authentic and specific. Her motivation to “craft safe zones for inquiry” stems credibly from past silence, and her micro-choices (narrating tasks, placing the bookmark in a sphere) reveal values under pressure. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“those cracks were where the light entered”) without sufficient contradiction or irrationality in-scene. The final renunciation of control is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s phobias and adaptive nature are stated but not fully dramatized under pressure—her internal conflict leans on summary (“vulnerability is power”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels earned thematically but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her transformation hinges more on symbolic objects than on flawed, active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oracle’s obsession is vividly embodied through tactile rituals and micro-choices (e.g., trembling fingers on the booklet), revealing interior contradiction between creative hunger and personal loss. Motivation intensifies credibly, culminating in a Charged Poise that forecloses dawn with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete perception (“ambered hush,” “flaking gold leaf”). The buried-child memory grounds their drive without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit-7’s motivation—to find where thoughts come from—is clear, consistent, and drives its pivotal choice to play the violin. Interiority is concrete (“thoughts unraveling like threads in a tapestry”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The robot’s composed demeanor contrasts with its yearning, creating credible internal tension. Its final renunciation (leaving the violin) feels earned, foreclosing its seeker phase with quiet certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her tracing of the ticket, her hesitation before acting—but her motivation lacks friction; transparency as a solution feels under-contested. Kian’s response is unearned by prior causality: his sudden openness contradicts the “guarded” tension without micro-choices that reconfigure his stance. The relationship functions more as backdrop than crucible, though the final exchange avoids diagnostic label-speak. A stronger cost—e.g., a sacrificed professional boundary—would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his gnarled hands, pragmatic silence, and ritualistic polishing reveal character through action. His motivation evolves credibly from commemoration to self-reckoning, and the final realization feels earned. However, his internal contradiction (“mended deception”) remains abstractly framed rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses. The epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“true meaning of mended deception”) without sufficient embodied tension in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her obsession with proving time moves sideways, and her “icy warmth” provides a compelling interior contradiction. Her micro-choices—hesitating before pulling the lever, recalibrating under pressure—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her emotional state remains slightly abstract (“icy warmth,” “mechanically warm”) without deeper embodiment during crisis, and her competence borders on effortless, softening the struggle. The final shift toward responsibility feels earned but lacks visceral physicality to fully ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her attraction to “in between spaces,” but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward revelation without resistance or doubt. Her emotional arc is embodied through tactile interaction with the program and environment, yet feels slightly streamlined, missing the friction of genuine struggle. The ghost functions more as a plot device than a crucible for relationship-based pressure. Final renunciation isn’t shown; instead, she receives closure without visible cost beyond dissolution of the program.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “auroral sorrow,” tactile engagement with the illustration, and cognitive dissonance around swallowed truth feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choice to smudge then rework the drawing reveals a hierarchy of values: truth as process over perfection. The wanderer functions effectively as a catalyst without diluting Elara’s singular POV. However, the final renunciation lacks a concrete cost beyond emotional shift, slightly undercutting the “felt price” requirement for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s recklessness and skepticism are established early and embodied in her cautious yet driven movement through the tunnel. Her internal conflict—between dismissal of her father’s beliefs and a dawning openness—is rendered with concrete sensory detail (“flashlight flickered,” “cool and smooth” beads). However, her shift from skeptic to believer occurs rapidly without sufficient micro-choices showing hesitation or recalibration under pressure. The final act feels motivated more by plot necessity than layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., gripping the swan tighter) and a credible arc from detached observer to integrated witness. Her choice to follow the map feels earned by rising unease, not whim. However, her transformation lacks a visible micro-choice under peak pressure—the mirror sequence dissolves agency into vision, flattening contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a music therapist, and her actions align with nurturing wonder. Finn’s fear-to-curiosity arc feels earned through their shared ritual. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped—Elara’s emotional stakes remain abstract rather than embodied under pressure. The final choice lacks visible cost; her “shift” in the curl’s purpose reads more like thematic affirmation than character-altering renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as an “odd historian” devoted to recovering lost dreams. Her interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing (“sensitively perceptive,” “probing the depths”) rather than embodied contradiction or specific emotional texture. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible personal cost—her success arrives without sacrifice, weakening the emotional stakes. A stronger showing of internal conflict or flawed perception under pressure would elevate this beyond competent into compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Li Wei’s motivation is declared rather than dramatized; their “latent power” emerges without prior struggle or contradiction. Interiority relies on abstract labels (“clarity,” “purpose”) instead of embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The shift from writer to “conductor of fate” feels unearned, lacking visible cost or flawed reasoning. No meaningful renunciation or trade-off grounds the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The loop pedal priest is vividly conceived, but his internal contradiction and emotional embodiment remain abstract. His motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions—is consistent, yet his struggle lacks tangible micro-choices with visible cost. The final declaration feels earned thematically but not through prior character-driven causality. He reads more as a vessel for concept than a fully inhabited individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—becoming “the conductor of unheard symphonies”—is vividly rendered through embodied longing and micro-choices (e.g., whispering into the shell, clutching it during exhaustion). However, internal contradiction remains abstract; their “chronological homesickness” functions more as lyrical label than active tension shaping decisions. The final collapse feels earned physically but lacks a clear psychological trade-off or renunciation that would elevate it to Earned Stasis. Emotional embodiment is strong (“breath fogged the glass,” “hand moved swiftly”), yet interiority leans toward poetic generalization over character-specific irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through embodied perception and contradictory impulses—e.g., her dread and hope coexisting as she steps onto the fractal viaduct. However, her epiphany at the center (“fractured timelines were not a curse but a gift”) leans toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of the struggle that earns it. The alternate selves serve more as thematic mirrors than pressure points forcing micro-choices with visible cost. Her final smile feels slightly unearned given the abstract resolution rather than a concrete renunciation or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict is embodied through tactile sensation and micro-choices (e.g., picking up the needle, building the device), avoiding diagnostic labels. Her emotional numbness and gradual reawakening feel earned, though the transition from despair to tearful catharsis leans slightly tidy for such profound trauma. The deaf music teacher premise grounds her motivation in credible contradiction—she seeks sound she cannot hear—but her competence with phonograph mechanics strains plausibility without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (“to nurture integrity in solitude”) is clear and consistent, and his curiosity drives key decisions. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his shift from solitude to action feels rational rather than wrestled with viscerally. The masked figure’s appearance triggers a swift, untroubled resolve that undercuts emotional complexity. His competence remains unchallenged; no genuine mistake or blind spot compounds the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s aromatically cautious trait and grief are embodied through concrete sensory avoidance and micro-choices (e.g., not using the vial for weeks). His internal conflict—longing for Lila versus fear of memory—is rendered with specificity, not therapy-speak. The final act of uncorking the vial feels earned by prior restraint, though his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without enough on-page struggle during the visions.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his frayed rope, tactile engagement with patterns, and layered memories reveal a coherent psyche under pressure. His motivation (“discover the texture of time”) intensifies credibly through micro-choices (kneeling, reciting, relinquishing the rope). The final renunciation feels earned: freedom vs. purpose crystallizes in a charged poise that forecloses drifting without resolution. However, the “ethically playful” trait remains abstract, slightly weakening motive specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is embodied through her hesitation, tactile interaction with the bowl, and climactic performance. Her acoustically perceptive nature informs her emotional arc without over-explaining. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves cleanly from doubt to resolve without competing impulses clashing mid-scene. The final renunciation (leaving the bowl) is earned but carries minimal felt cost beyond symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “affectionate detachment” manifests in embodied choices (gloved handling of the petal, deliberate subsumption) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation (“fuse insight with empathy”) drives a credible endurance: she crafts joy for Kael while accepting its transience, foreclosing her own entanglement at a felt cost. The half-truth framework sharpens her moral ambiguity without safety-hedging. Minor deduction: Kael’s off-page presence limits relationship-as-crucible depth, but Elara’s micro-choices under pressure fully satisfy single-POV expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in cycles of compassion—is consistent and shapes her actions, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves cleanly from curiosity to action without hesitation or resistance. The locket photo functions more as a thematic token than a source of embodied emotional tension. Clara’s late appearance offers little relational pressure, limiting crucible dynamics. Still, Elara’s occupational identity subtly informs her worldview, avoiding pure stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her yearning for belonging drives every action—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from outsider to insider without resisting the very sympathy that defines her. The final realization feels earned, yet her emotional arc leans toward tidy resolution rather than layered struggle. Her “boldly sympathetic” nature enables connection but exacts no visible cost beyond initial loneliness, softening the stakes. Still, her micro-choices (questioning residents, weaving their stories into reeds) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—her artistic stagnation and longing for temporal harmony—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly through micro-choices (stepping onto the ledge, pressing the pendant to the gate). Her internal conflict between control and surrender manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of “owning” time feels earned, with cost implied in her acceptance of rhythm over capture. However, the epiphany leans slightly abstract despite strong embodiment elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding ambiguous loss through the “mathematics of emotion”—is consistent and deeply personal, rooted in her mentor’s disappearance. Her interiority is concrete (“her mind racing with possibilities,” “buried optimism”), and her micro-choices (pocketing the eyes, comparing shadows to mosaics) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from caution to “renewed determination” lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final breakthrough feels earned but borders on diagnostic clarity rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crawl space dweller’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in their "kindly methodical" nature. Interiority is concrete—especially in tactile descriptions of handling fragments—but emotional progression leans slightly tidy, avoiding deeper contradiction. The final choice feels earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. No secondary characters limit relational crucible opportunities, but single-POV execution is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the leaf’s warmth, her laughter amid rain—but her transformation leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“reluctant metamorphosis,” “surrendering to the process”) that edges into label-speak during peak beats. Her contradiction (control vs. surrender) acts in scene through micro-choices like rearranging pots, yet the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle, flattening the cost of change. The circuitous sincerity trait is noted but not dramatized as a behavioral constraint with tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s wry earnestness and insomnia shape her choices with specificity, particularly in her restless pursuit of meaning through art. Her internal contradiction—laughing at failure while clinging to hope—is embodied in action, not summary. The final renunciation of mere painting for story-keeping feels earned by prior causality. However, the old woman’s near-mirroring of Elara’s “wryly earnest” tone slightly flattens their dynamic, reducing relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—clairvoyant yet blind to her own pivotal moment—is conceptually strong but under-embodied; her transformation leans on declarative insight (“her gift was not to predict… but to embrace”) rather than micro-choices under pressure. The cave pearl triggers change passively, reducing agency. Emotional progression lacks irrationality or hypocrisy; she moves cleanly from doubt to purpose without credible struggle. Interiority uses lyrical abstraction (“gnawing doubt,” “steadily unpredictable”) over concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her tactile engagement with fragments, the valve, and the harbor grounds her archivist identity. Her internal conflict (dismissed by elders yet compelled by vision) manifests in micro-choices like clutching the valve or kneeling to extract wood. The encounter with the gray-cloaked woman crystallizes her role without over-explaining. However, the stranger’s abrupt dissolution leans slightly on mystique over earned causality, softening the final renunciation’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her analytical-artistic lens, and her micro-choices (e.g., clutching the punch at midnight) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—she moves from curiosity to resolve without meaningful hesitation or self-sabotage. The epiphany about “courage and curiosity” feels slightly abstract but is earned by prior action. Her flaw (over-reliance on control) is shown, not just stated, yet the emotional cost of abandoning mapped routes remains implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her skepticism warring with longing feels lived-in, not abstract. Her micro-choices (transcribing, climbing the tower) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over caution. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the shift from skeptic to believer lacks friction or misstep. The “courageously kind” trait is asserted but not tested through costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elyr’s motivation—boredom transmuted into desperate curiosity—is clear and consistent, driving his high-stakes choice to wield the cursed fragment. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile perception (“cool surface warming under his touch”) and sensory immersion. However, his transformation from void to “spark of purpose” leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the cost of his action (the mutiny’s chaos) is felt but not deeply personalized beyond atmospheric upheaval. The final stance feels resonant but lacks a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a specific path with individualized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s internal contradiction—honesty as both shield and burden—is embodied in her trembling yet firm voice and her refusal to return the ink pot. Her motivation (“mathematics of a fair trade”) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of flight. The father’s shift from frustration to tentative sincerity feels earned, not sentimental. However, his interiority remains slightly opaque, limiting full reciprocity in the crucible of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her studious nature and devotion to invented histories. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile engagement with tools and environment—and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final choice (preserving the memory) feels earned, though internal contradiction remains underexplored; she experiences awe but no palpable conflict or tradeoff that deepens her character beyond reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—recovering erased histories—is consistent and compelling, rooted in their own erasure. Interiority is filtered through a unique perceptual lens ("seeing patterns where others saw chaos"), though it occasionally veers toward abstraction (“texture of memories”) without sufficient embodied contradiction. The final choice to become a “guardian of the forgotten” feels earned by prior accumulation, but lacks a decisive micro-choice with visible cost; endurance substitutes for action. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her myth-busting identity and grief, yet her internal contradiction—seeking proof while embracing impermanence—feels slightly abstract rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The epiphany arrives with emotional honesty but borders on diagnostic (“the courage to embrace the ephemeral”) without sufficient prior struggle that manifests physically or tactically. Her action (playing the cello) aligns with motive, but the cost of her shift remains conceptual rather than concretely felt in behavior or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she shifts from exhaustion to resolve without tangible struggle. Her “orderly intuitive” trait is stated but rarely constrains choices under pressure. Vorin serves as a functional antagonist but remains a caricature, limiting relational depth. The final choice feels earned thematically but not through layered psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tactile interaction with the hourglass grain and her reaction to the mentor’s message. Her “purposefully curious” trait drives action, but the final choice—staying past dawn—is more endurance than active decision, slightly limiting agency. The mentor’s off-page influence creates emotional depth without undermining Elara’s autonomy. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; grief and duty align too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her blindness informs perception through air shifts, sound, and refracted light. Her motivation to mend trust between humans and machines is consistent and deepened by tactile engagement with the drone. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she remains serene throughout without internal friction that would complicate her choices under pressure. The absence of struggle or doubt flattens the stakes despite strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her dry wit, obsession with origins, and emotional restraint feel lived-in. Her micro-choices (tracing the phrasebook, kneeling on ice) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over comfort, pattern over certainty. The tear at the source avoids sentimentality by framing it as understanding, not joy. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward revelation without meaningful resistance or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in a desire to restore balance, but his interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. The trait “infinitely patient” is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His actions align with his goal, yet no visible cost or trade-off emerges from his patience—no fatigue, doubt, or sacrifice sharpens the stakes. The character functions more as a vessel for theme than a fully realized individual with flawed, specific humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s motivation shifts convincingly from survival to discovery, and her interiority is filtered through tactile engagement with the vial. However, emotional progression leans on abstract labels like “lonesome splendor” without sufficient embodied contradiction or degradation under stress. The final choice feels more epiphanic than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Her scientific identity remains underutilized beyond premise scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—redemption from ancestral shame—is clear and consistent, and his rejection of silence for truth feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“clutched the lattice,” “heart pounded”), though his emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“realized it wasn’t what he wanted”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice forecloses the path of inherited silence with visible cost: he abandons the hush that could have absolved him. However, the lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene (e.g., longing for silence even as he rejects it) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost bride’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, the “lovingly venomous” pull of memory—but her final choice lacks a micro-action that concretely forecloses a path. Her motivation is consistent and emotionally layered, yet the climax hinges on passive reception (“whispers urged her forward”) rather than an active renunciation or decision with visible cost. The betrayal backstory is evocative but functions more as mood than causal pressure shaping present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poetic response to ecological ruin, but her interiority lacks contradiction or struggle—she moves with unwavering purpose, never wavering under pressure. Her “hauntingly optimistic” trait reads as a label rather than an embodied tension that shapes micro-choices with cost. The absence of internal conflict or flawed decision-making undercuts emotional realism, especially in a story about mending broken precedents. Final endurance feels earned thematically but not psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring faith through ancestral reconnection—is clear and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is concrete (“warmly curious,” “cautious enchantment”) and embodied in deliberate actions like “purposeful wandering.” However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; doubt and hope alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The final renunciation of displacement for rooted belonging is earned but arrives without visible cost beyond emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her “carefully inventive” nature informs her perception and actions. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain underdeveloped—her emotional responses lean toward summary (“heart quickened,” “smiled”) rather than visceral, conflicting sensations. The final choice lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation that would elevate it to Earned Stasis; she simply succeeds. Her competence borders on frictionless, undercutting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her needle hovering, her grip on the dagger—and her motivation to “listen for unheard stories” deepens credibly under pressure. Lira’s return tests Elara’s skepticism, forcing a micro-choice that aligns with her mentor’s cryptic wisdom. However, Lira’s sudden reappearance lacks sufficient friction; her urgency feels imposed rather than earned through visible struggle. The final resolve is compelling but slightly under-pressured given the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with interiority rendered through concrete sensory experience rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—pressing the shard to the glass, breaking the seal—are consistent with her desire to give voice to regret. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from burden to wholeness occurs without sufficient friction or contradictory impulse during the climax. The shard trembles, but Elara herself shows little internal resistance at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s "shrewdly innocent" nature is embodied through her tactile engagement with the coral and cast, not merely labeled. Her motivation—to graft meaning onto wounds—is dramatized via micro-choices (tracing condensation, deciphering smudged notes) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional state leans toward lyrical abstraction (“lotus-hearted ache”) rather than fully contradictory, embodied impulses under pressure. The resolution feels earned but borders on epiphanic tidiness without sufficient internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tactile interactions with the fresco fragment and film. Her motivation—rediscovering lost joy—is consistent and intensifies credibly. However, her final epiphany (“her art had never truly been about the pigments…”) leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient micro-choice buildup to fully earn the insight as non-abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior conflict between methodical control and surrendering to curiosity is embodied in her dance-like restoration and hesitation before the obsidian-eyed figure. Her micro-choice to hum rather than paint reveals a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. However, the transition from skepticism to full trust lacks a beat showing genuine resistance—her nod feels slightly facile given her established nature. The hobo nickel’s warmth substitutes for deeper psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—defiance rooted in linguistic freedom—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure. His charm and scholarly past inform micro-choices (e.g., sketching symbols, quipping with Krane), revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete (“fingers trembling,” “chaos converging in his chest”) without diagnostic label-speak. However, his transformation lacks a contradictory impulse acting *simultaneously* in-scene; fear and defiance alternate rather than collide.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation is vividly rendered—"to photosynthesize pain into beauty"—and her “shyly unstoppable” nature manifests in trembling yet resolute action. However, interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction (“reef-shadow joy,” “blossom armistice”) without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Emotions are poetic but not always grounded in specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels earned thematically but lacks a decisive on-page renunciation or trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “foxglove regret,” trembling hands, and systematic grace reveal a character shaped by sacred duty and emotional weight. Her motivation to preserve forgotten names drives every action, culminating in a climactic choice that feels earned. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see devotion but not the tension between preservation and letting go. The final endurance lacks a micro-choice that crystallizes a foreclosed path with sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” duality is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., trembling hands yet deliberate quill dip) and fuels her internal conflict without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation—restoring trust through self-accountability—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Kael’s presence crystallizes relational stakes, though his characterization leans slightly archetypal. The final exchange (“you were careful too”) earns its emotional weight through prior causality and visible cost: Elara’s vulnerability replaces recklessness.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between technical precision and emotional risk—is credibly embodied in his trembling hands and gear-like cognition. His motivation to harmonize opposing values drives every action, and the resolution (a floodgate design encoding “encrypted compassion”) feels earned. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy synthesis; the “slyly heartfelt” trait is stated more than dramatized through costly contradiction. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her reinvented history versus her yearning for lost songs—and her micro-choices (e.g., clutching the meteorite while watching dust) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, though the final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over incremental struggle. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; the single-POV frame holds tightly. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak but borders on lyrical abstraction in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in childhood loss and a search for meaning, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her realization feels linear rather than wrestled from competing desires. The epiphany about “sacred thresholds” is earned through memory but leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“parts of ourselves we left behind”) that borders on therapy-speak at the climax. Her micro-choice to leave the logbook is resonant and costly, showing renunciation with emotional weight. However, the father’s absence remains abstract, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her longing for belonging manifests through tactile engagement with the feather, fireflies, and journal. Her micro-choices (sketching, joining the dance, hesitating before escape) reveal a hierarchy of values: connection over safety. However, her epiphany about rhythm feels slightly too articulate for mid-crisis; the diagnostic phrasing (“belonging wasn’t about finding a place…”) edges toward label-speak without immediate embodied counterbalance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her longing for her grandmother’s laughter isn’t stated but felt through tactile interactions with seed and glass. Her micro-choices (first pressing the seed, then refocusing on emotion) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding insight in action: “the missing pieces were not lost but hidden within her own heart.” However, the shift from frustration to peace leans slightly tidy given the depth of her prior void.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—his rebellion against monotony through orchestrated serendipity—but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in-scene. His transformation from cog to catalyst is told rather than dramatized, weakening emotional credibility. The “lightly attentive” trait is named but not tested under pressure with visible cost. Final renunciation (of ordinary life) feels earned thematically but not causally rooted in on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly rooted in loss and defiance, with interiority rendered through embodied action—her trembling hands, bare feet, and dance-as-memory. Her contradiction (stillness vs. urge to fledge) pulses throughout, culminating in a credible renunciation of fear. The sentinel encounter tests her stance without melodrama, and her refusal to flee reads as earned endurance. However, the backstory block slightly exceeds BRR limits without fully interleaving micro-choices, costing half a point.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to illuminate the mundane—is consistent and embodied through his ritual with the prism and pond, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves from observation to resolve without resistance or struggle. His “noctilucent reckonings” feel more like aesthetic epiphanies than hard-won insights with personal cost. The final decision to share his vision is declared rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path. Still, his voice and perception are specific, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied emotion and concrete memory, especially in the flashback to his crew’s loss. His contradictions—heroism vs. guilt, tenderness vs. trauma—are consistent and shape micro-choices like handling the box. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“pain could be a language”) without sufficient on-page struggle to earn it fully. The final renunciation feels resonant but borders on tidy given the depth of prior trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a “logical dreamer” is vividly embodied through her tactile engagement with patterns and the altitude gauge. Her internal contradiction—seeking equations for hope while accepting impermanence—is rendered without diagnostic label-speak. The epiphany feels earned because it arises from physical action, not abstraction. However, the absence of external pressure or interpersonal friction limits the depth of her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corridor Echo Cartographer’s motivation—rooted in generational legacy and perceptual sensitivity—drives consistent, embodied choices. Her internal conflict between obsession and preservation manifests in micro-decisions (e.g., trembling fingers extracting diaries, pressing the wall). The final renunciation of mapping for honoring feels earned, though the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in empathy and sacrifice, and her internal conflict—between giving her heartbeat and sustaining herself—is embodied with restraint. Her calmness under pressure feels earned, not decorative. However, her character remains slightly archetypal; we see the cost of her actions but not enough contradictory impulses in real time to fully humanize her beyond the poetic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict—ideals eroded by war yet clinging to hope—is credibly rendered, and her trembling speech on the third night reveals embodied exhaustion. However, her motivation remains largely abstract (“anchor ideals in practice”) without concrete micro-choices that demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The “operatively gentle” trait is stated but not dramatized through specific trade-offs. Her emotional arc feels earnest but leans on summary over granular, character-particular behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—amoral wealth-building versus secret sentimentality—are embodied in her tactile handling of the egg and her environmental awareness. Her micro-choice to kneel and bury the egg enacts renunciation with visible cost: relinquishing control over a priceless relic. However, her internal conflict remains largely summarized rather than dramatized in real-time pressure; the “haunted” backstory lacks a present-moment struggle that alters tactics. The final act feels earned but leans on reflection over active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to defy conformity—is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between role and rebellion is embodied through precise physicality (“bodily poetic grace,” “fingers brushing against the threads”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves with unwavering resolve, flattening the tension between fear and duty. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but interiority remains concrete and particular. Her final smile feels earned, though the cost of her transformation remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile interaction with the campfire stick and embodied doubt, but his “uncommonly serene” trait functions more as label than lived constraint. His ethical struggle feels genuine, yet the resolution leans on a tidy epiphany (“rebuild instead of dismantle”) that lacks the friction of competing impulses in scene. The absence of other on-page characters limits relational crucible, though his micro-choice to shift artistic method carries thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through sensory perception and symbolic action, yet her motivation lacks friction—her choices feel inevitable rather than pressured. The “esoteric realist” trait informs observation but doesn’t generate internal contradiction or costly trade-offs. Her humming and placement of wings are expressive but not decisions that foreclose alternatives. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but the single-POV execution remains coherent and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in regret and preservation, with embodied emotion (“hands that were both precise and tender”) and a clear interior arc culminating in “snowmelt ardor.” Her micro-choices—unraveling the rope, trusting the card—are consistent with her identity as a wax caster who shapes memory. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her resolve feels steady rather than contested in-scene. The final renunciation of isolation is earned, but the cost remains abstract rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Foresight’s motivation is clear and consistent, but their interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“transcend the limitations of their own understanding”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The epiphany arrives with emotional weight but lacks struggle—no visible missteps, fatigue, or flawed interpretations that would ground their insight in credible human limitation. The character reads more as a vessel for theme than an individual with idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s “empirically ironic” nature is stated but rarely dramatized as contradictory impulses in-scene; his shift from skeptic to believer occurs without sufficient internal friction or embodied struggle. Motivation (“seal a covenant with the unknown”) remains abstract rather than tested through concrete micro-choices with cost. The frugality trait surfaces only as label, not as behavior that constrains action. Final renunciation lacks visible foreclosed path—his transformation feels declared, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” identity creates a compelling internal contradiction, but her transformation of Kael leans on diagnostic label-speak (“buried it under layers of anger and pain”) rather than embodied struggle. Kael’s shift from resentment to hope lacks credible friction—his defenses collapse too readily after one memory probe. Both characters remain archetypal (the healer, the wounded warrior) with minimal idiosyncrasy in voice or gesture. The final micro-choice (“How do I start?”) feels unearned given the absence of prior resistance that costs Elara anything.

    Elara’s interior contradiction—grounded yet yearning—is embodied through tactile actions (breathing with the cosmos, handling glass) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a choice that bridges dream and reality. The wanderer applies immediate, relevant pressure by introducing the sextant as both object and test. Final renunciation of pure escapism in favor of bridging worlds is earned and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her quartz eyes, the ribbon, her feisty resilience—but her emotional shift hinges on near-magical object behavior (compass pointing to ribbon) that risks feeling unearned. Her contradictory impulses (regret vs. determination) are embodied well, yet the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The cost of the breach is felt, but Lyra’s absence limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered, especially her attraction to the “simply complicated,” but her transformation leans on diagnostic phrasing (“nonlinear inheritance”) rather than embodied contradiction. The cameo catalyzes insight, yet her emotional shift from bewilderment to clarity lacks visceral friction or trade-off. Her final resolve feels earned thematically but not through on-page struggle—more epiphany than choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is stated but rarely tested under genuine pressure; her competence borders on frictionless, with obstacles bypassed rather than struggled through. Kael remains a vague catalyst without reciprocal pressure or status dynamics. The final bargain lacks visible cost or internal contradiction—motivation stays consistent but unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally grounded, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—her sorrow and curiosity alternate rather than collide. The epiphany about “unkindled solace” arrives as a tidy realization, not an earned micro-choice under pressure. Her actions align with motive, yet the twin relationship remains abstract, referenced but not dramatized, weakening the crucible. The final step through the door feels more symbolic than causally compelled by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and traits are clearly established, and her “warmly methodical” nature informs her actions. However, interiority remains largely declarative (“her motivation was clear,” “her approach was warmly methodical”) rather than embodied through contradiction or struggle. No meaningful internal conflict or flawed decision-making complicates her path—she succeeds cleanly. This lack of friction or cost in her choices prevents deeper characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as mapkeeper, and her actions align with her goal to restore balance. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves with unwavering resolve, missing opportunities for emotional complexity or struggle under pressure. The absence of doubt, hesitation, or competing desires flattens her interiority despite strong external stakes. Her endurance feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief that coincidences hold meaning—a conviction tested through tangible sacrifice. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“hands trembling with thistle-blown hope,” memory loss during ritual), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc leans slightly tidy: the transition from doubt to peace lacks contradictory impulses in-scene, softening the cost of memory loss. The final renunciation feels earned but not fully conflicted—more acceptance than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s preemptive nostalgia and archivist role are vividly embodied, driving her meticulous actions and melancholic interiority. Her motivation is consistent and rooted in character-specific traits, though the story lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path with tangible cost. The emotional arc remains internalized without contradiction under pressure—she observes, receives visions, but doesn’t actively wrestle with competing impulses in-scene. This limits the depth of agency expected at elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a creator-defier of despair, and her micro-choices (spinning the rag knot, arranging the mosaic) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“heart ached, but resolve deepened”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The absence of internal struggle beyond noble resolve flattens emotional complexity. Her transformation feels earned but lacks the friction of genuine flaw or blind spot.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “warmly observant” nature and belief in tangential truth, compelling her retreat to the grotto. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile interaction with the cicada and sensory immersion. The shift from seeking to *becoming* part of time’s texture feels earned by her sustained attention and prior conflict with Kael. However, the absence of on-page interaction with Kael limits relational crucible depth, capping full character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and yearning for open silence are vividly embodied, and her micro-choices—practicing climbs, whispering to the doll—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. However, her motivation to “collect flavors of silences” remains abstractly poetic rather than concretely dramatized through conflicting impulses in-scene. The father functions more as atmosphere than crucible; his pressure is declared but never tested in direct interaction, weakening relational stakes. Her final transformation feels earned emotionally but lacks a decisive internal contradiction resolved under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s embodied restlessness and gradual calming feel authentic, and Elias’s quiet competence avoids saintly caricature. His motivation—to teach silence how to comfort—is dramatized through micro-choices (course adjustment, timing of speech) rather than stated dogma. However, his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see consistency, not struggle. The storm glass reflects emotion but doesn’t force Elias into a morally complex or costly decision that reveals deeper layers.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s “wisely adventurous” trait is embodied in her cautious yet persistent actions, especially during mural excavation and archway decoding. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, relying instead on sensory cues and micro-choices (e.g., tightening her grip on the ruby flake). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she never wavers or doubts, flattening internal conflict. The final renunciation of personal power feels earned but arrives without visible struggle, undercutting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to teach suffocating to breathe—is compellingly paradoxical and embodied through her scar-linking method. Her internal conflict is shown via micro-choices (sacrificing a scar) rather than summarized, and the cost is felt viscerally in the hollow ache post-climax. However, her emotional state leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“loaded emptiness,” “tender shadow keeper”) without fully dramatizing contradictory impulses mid-crisis. The renunciation of a saved soul is earned and costly, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “virtuously mischievous” trait is named but only lightly embodied—her actions follow curiosity more than moral ambiguity. Her pyramid scheme past informs motive but doesn’t actively shape choices under pressure; it’s backstory without present friction. The future-self encounter lacks internal contradiction or struggle, leaning on mystical resolution over earned transformation. Final grin feels untested by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in legacy and intuition, and her final renunciation—choosing truth over revival—is credibly earned. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; her emotional state remains steady rather than layered with simultaneous impulses. The “eloquently silent” trait reads more as a label than a lived tension with cost. Her micro-choices (turning the crank, accepting the journal) align with motive but lack visible trade-offs that would elevate this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alaric’s withdrawn nature and trauma are embodied through tactile details (crumpled program, gauntlet removal) rather than exposition. His contradictory impulses—longing for joy vs. burden of past—act simultaneously in scene. The final shift to “storyteller” feels earned by his micro-choices (unsnap, trace vines), though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. Cost is felt in the shedding of armor-as-burden, not just declared.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “tactfully hopeful” stance emerges through micro-choices (e.g., brushing dust, cross-referencing names) rather than labels. Her motivation ties directly to her past without over-explanation, and her emotional shift feels earned. However, the final decision lacks a visible cost beyond internal catharsis, slightly weakening the Earned Stasis. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness and maintains embodied contradiction throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role as truth-seeker, but interiority leans on declarative labels (“tyranny of indifference,” “coded freedom”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her resourcefulness is asserted more than dramatized under pressure—e.g., the puddle-map method is mentioned but not shown failing or costing her. The final choice to broadcast feels earned, yet lacks micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The saxophonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are conveyed through lyrical description (“breath syncing with dewdrops”) rather than contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His struggle lacks tangible friction—no visible cost beyond exertion—and his flaw is undefined, making his endurance feel unearned. The character functions more as a vessel for atmosphere than a conflicted agent.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in generational duty, but her internal conflict lacks contradiction—she moves seamlessly from curiosity to conviction without resistance or doubt. Her transformation feels earned thematically but not psychologically; the absence of struggle or misstep flattens emotional stakes. The “mossy delight” remains a static trait rather than a contested impulse under pressure. Final renunciation or endurance isn’t tested; she simply expands her role without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tinkerer’s internal contradiction—between his desire for precision and his intuitive reverence for time’s mystery—is embodied in his actions and choices, not just stated. His micro-choices (e.g., following the compass despite its chaos) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: abandoning his old pursuit of accuracy. However, the final epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak (“befriended uncertainty in planning”), which borders on over-articulation for a mid-crisis realization.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her motivation to understand “the weight of names” manifests through embodied choices (e.g., stepping into the furnace) rather than abstract musing. Her contradictions feel lived: drawn to redemption yet wary of what it reveals. The kintsugi flask subtly mirrors her philosophy without over-explaining. Final resolve feels earned, though a sharper micro-choice under peak pressure would push this into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to integrate laughter into healing—is compelling and embodied through her harp-playing and compassionate stance. Her “modest fearlessness” reads as authentic restraint rather than bravado, especially when she chooses to listen instead of extract. However, the lost soul’s emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient internal contradiction; his grief resolves with poetic ease rather than struggle. The crocodile’s tooth functions more as symbol than catalyst for character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and intellectual pursuit, and her proprioceptive enhancements ground her perception in embodied specificity. The pewter mask functions as both relic and symbol without veering into diagnostic label-speak. However, the epiphany about mercy leans slightly toward unearned conceptual clarity—felt more as lyrical assertion than struggle-won insight. Final renunciation (mask release) is resonant but lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s motivation is vividly rooted in childhood memory and sustained by consistent interiority, but her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves with near-ritual certainty. The lens fragment guides her without resistance, flattening struggle into reverence. Her choices reveal values but incur no tangible cost beyond atmospheric weight. For a story this lyrical, that’s acceptable—but not exceptional under high-stakes literary scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—his gift and obsession with hidden truths—is consistent and embodied through tactile observation and micro-choices (e.g., dust analysis, ceiling climb). His emotional arc moves credibly from curiosity to closure, though internal contradiction remains underexplored; the “weightless burden” is stated more than dramatized. The ghost girl functions as guide, not crucible, limiting relational pressure. Final renunciation of the space feels earned but lacks a visible personal cost beyond atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is compelling and consistent, driving her toward the rupture and descent. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers danced,” “heart quickened”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional shift from order-obsessed operator to cosmic caretaker lacks micro-choices that dramatize internal contradiction; the transformation feels more epiphanic than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—redemption through proving “temporal plasticity”—is consistent and deeply personal, rooted in her fall from academic grace. Her interiority is concrete (“tears... of burnished sorrow”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The shard functions as both talisman and tool, revealing her contradictory impulses: scholarly rigor vs. poetic faith. However, her final emotional state lacks micro-choices that visibly alter her path beyond passive endurance, slightly undercutting the cost of her triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—curiosity tugging him toward danger—is consistent and embodied through tactile descriptions of his hands and workshop. His internal conflict (caution vs. wonder) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final act of “freeing” rather than repairing feels earned by his established identity as a listener to objects. However, the stranger vanishes without meaningful interaction, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her “sensibly eccentric” nature and inherited quest—is consistent and compelling. Her interiority is concrete (“psychometry reading tingling,” “heart quickened”), and her final renunciation of the compass feels earned. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward acceptance without meaningful resistance or hesitation that would deepen psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is vividly rendered through tactile detail (“calloused yet nimble hands”) and poetic perception (“turbine-hum reverie”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily from curiosity to purpose without internal resistance or doubt, flattening tension. The epiphany feels earned by the object’s magic rather than by struggle, reducing the cost of her transformation. Her “spirited” trait remains descriptive rather than dramatized through flawed choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in childhood wonder and artistic obsession—is consistent and compelling, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward revelation without meaningful resistance or doubt. Her “quietly driven” trait functions more as label than lived tension. The final realization feels earned by experience but emerges as epiphany rather than hard-won reckoning with flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as an archivist seeking truth, but her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“retrocognitively trapped,” “searing reverie”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices—arranging debris, clutching the diary—are purposeful but lack visible trade-offs or flawed decision-making under pressure. The final stance feels earned thematically but not causally; her readiness to listen is declared, not dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her rejection of nostalgia in favor of creation reveals interior contradiction. However, her emotional embodiment remains abstract (“heart pounding,” “mind racing”) without tactile specificity under pressure. The final renunciation—walking away—is credible but lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs her something personal beyond implied solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to archive emotional patterns—is credibly rooted in ancestral legacy, not mere curiosity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“velvet disquiet,” fingers brushing the shaving). The final act—speaking “I remember”—is a renunciation that forecloses silence with felt cost. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, but her internal contradiction (“furiously tranquil”) remains underexplored as simultaneous impulses—it reads more as lyrical phrasing than embodied conflict. Her micro-choices (pressing the acorn cap, stepping through) align with motive, yet the emotional shift from fury to resolve lacks friction or cost. The winged creature functions more as symbol than crucible, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to favor listening over noise—is consistent and embodied through tactile engagement with the rope and sensors. His “credibly curious” nature drives micro-choices (noticing the twitch, pulling the rope) that feel authentic to his profession and inner life. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves smoothly from observation to revelation without resistance or doubt, softening the emotional stakes. The final reconfiguration feels earned but leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s spiritually curious nature and janitorial role are consistently embodied, especially in her tactile interaction with the lantern and her reinterpreted cleaning rituals. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—her epiphany about “flourishing stillness” arrives as a smooth realization rather than a wrestled insight. The final choice to place the lantern on the shelf feels earned but carries minimal visible cost; her transformation is serene, not sacrificial. This softens the emotional stakes expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in his perceptive solitude, but his transformation lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His choices feel inevitable rather than fraught, with minimal friction between desire and cost. The epiphany about “giving voice to what had been left unsaid” arrives without prior psychological groundwork, leaning on thematic assertion over dramatized inner conflict. While credible, his arc avoids the messy ambiguity that would elevate it to publishable literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied reactions (e.g., “strange warmth spread through her”) and micro-choices (crafting cryptic garage sale descriptions) that reveal her values under pressure. Thaddeus functions credibly as a secondary character whose emotional stakes directly feed the central conflict. However, Elara’s transformation lacks a visible internal contradiction—her motivation remains singularly focused without competing impulses muddying her path, slightly softening the emotional complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s motivation and internal conflict are clearly rooted in her desire to find beauty in incompleteness, embodied through tactile interactions with the feather and kite. The wanderer’s arc—relearning attentiveness—is credibly earned through shared action, not exposition. However, his transformation leans slightly on convenience; the mutual repair feels intuitive but lacks friction or hesitation that would deepen authenticity. Both characters remain archetypal yet emotionally legible within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect before death—is clear and intensifies credibly, driving his remodeling work. His “gently systematic” nature is embodied in precise actions (e.g., copper-wrapping branches), not just stated. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped; we see calm resolve but little contradictory impulse or struggle under pressure. The final renunciation (“The orchard is not mine to keep”) feels earned, though the emotional cost lacks visceral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered—her skepticism, curiosity, and emotional shift feel earned through embodied reactions (e.g., clutching amber, silenced by “bronze quiet”). Her academic rebelliousness informs her lens but doesn’t dictate outcomes. The final renunciation of pure skepticism for “quiet awe” constitutes Earned Stasis with felt cost: she surrenders intellectual armor. However, the internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; doubt yields too cleanly to wonder without active resistance in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coachman’s motivation is clear and consistent—transforming death into life—but his interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are conveyed through lyrical summary (“heart heavy with memories”) rather than concrete, contradictory impulses in scene. His micro-choices (kneeling, placing pods) align with motive but lack visible cost or struggle. The character reads as archetype more than individual, though his ritualistic actions feel purposeful within the story’s accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is grounded in sensory detail and past trauma, with micro-choices (accepting the leaf, cranking the phonograph) revealing his reawakened curiosity. His transformation feels earned through tactile engagement rather than abstract epiphany. Lira’s presence applies light but credible pressure, though her role leans slightly functional. The final renunciation of solitude carries quiet cost—reconnection demands vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with poetic specificity, yet her motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her “blessed pariah” status is asserted more than embodied in action; the pivotal decision to “turn confusion into exploration” lacks friction or cost in the moment. The epiphany about true north feels earned thematically but not causally—no prior struggle or contradiction forces it. Emotional embodiment leans on lyrical abstraction (“heart heavy with purpose”) over concrete, contradictory sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—restoring the sky to heal a broken world—is clear and consistent, rooted in his past as an “apprentice of wonder.” His internal conflict between survivalist pragmatism and resurgent idealism is stated but not fully dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead, it shifts cleanly mid-climb. The final sacrifice (queen for rook) mirrors thematic willingness to risk all, yet feels more symbolic than psychologically fraught. His chivalrous thief identity informs tone more than tangible choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a crisis actor seeking authenticity. Her internal conflict—between performance and self—is embodied through tactile engagement with the chessboard and walking ritual. However, Kael’s “benevolently ruthless” trait remains declarative rather than dramatized in action, weakening relational pressure. The final realization feels earned but leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“luminous absence”) that borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand “the shape of home”—is compelling and rooted in embodied memory (e.g., the feather texture), but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward resolution without meaningful resistance or self-sabotage. Her transformation feels earned yet slightly streamlined, with emotional progression leaning toward lyrical clarity over messy human complexity. The “mercury-glass seer” trait is evocative but underutilized as a source of flaw or limitation during pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal conflict is rendered with specificity—her fidgeting, chess piece, and guilt are embodied rather than labeled. Her motivation (self-forgiveness) intensifies through tactile engagement with the tapestry, culminating in a credible emotional shift. However, the epiphany (“Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey”) borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned transformation. The final renunciation of self-blame carries quiet cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a defiant artist seeking personal forgiveness. Her internal conflict—between rebellion and reconciliation—is embodied in her poetic utterances and physical interaction with the spire. However, the emotional progression leans toward diagnostic self-awareness (“Forgiveness is a mirror…”) that borders on therapy-speak without sufficient contradictory behavior to offset it. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a micro-choice under immediate pressure that visibly costs her something tangible beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally grounded, with embodied gestures (trembling hands, clutching the charm) that convey uncertainty without diagnostic label-speak. Her internal conflict—between fear of loss and drive to recover meaning—is consistent, but her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than earned causality. The final renunciation (“we are all broken…”) feels resonant but lacks a prior micro-choice that visibly sacrifices an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (“hands trembled,” “heart lighter”) and a clear hierarchy of values centered on her promise. However, her pivotal choice to paint the oasis feels slightly under-pressurized—there’s no tangible resistance or trade-off beyond internal hesitation. The trait “intimately aloof” is stated but not dramatized through behavior that incurs cost. Her transformation is credible but lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between silence as weakness and quiet strength—is embodied through tactile actions (handling the cork, inhaling its scent) and micro-choices (responding to the beckoning figure). His motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, though the epiphany leans slightly toward the diagnostic (“intentions purified by stillness”). The woman’s appearance risks externalizing his arc too cleanly, but her role remains minimal enough to preserve interior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her patchwork identity informs both her resilience and her method. Her emotional arc moves from isolation to purpose without sentimentality, and her micro-choices (scavenging parts, trusting the censer) reveal consistent values. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her resolve lacks friction from competing impulses. The traveler’s arrival feels earned, but Mara’s transformation leans slightly tidy for a story trafficking in “raw solace.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—psychological safety—is credibly rooted in post-viral trauma and shapes his precise, emotion-avoidant behavior. His internal conflict (rationality vs. involuntary truth) manifests physically and linguistically, not through diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of the eye is earned by prior choices and carries felt cost: loss of control, then restoration through ritual. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the epiphany (“psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths…”), which borders on therapy-speak but is anchored by immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his obsession with gaps, the tactile handling of the journal and boot print, and the embodied weight of borrowed memory feel particular, not diagnostic. His micro-choice to investigate (kneeling, brushing the imprint) reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort. However, the final “peace” arrives with minimal friction; the shift from confusion to acceptance lacks a visible internal struggle that would ground the emotional cost in scene. The Edelweiss functions more as symbol than catalyst for contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and grounded in tactile observation, but his transformation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—his acceptance of purpose feels smooth rather than fraught. The “empirically intuitive” trait is stated but not dramatized through struggle or error. His final shift from loneliness to purpose is emotionally legible but leans on summary (“no longer lonely”) rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s motivation—driven by recurring dreams and a sense of responsibility—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her internal conflict between disenchantment and duty manifests in embodied choices (e.g., deliberate steps, steadied resolve). However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the shift from mystery-seeker to burden-bearer lacks micro-choices that visibly trade personal desire for communal duty. The final vow feels resonant but minimally foreshadowed by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rendered and consistent, rooted in her “scientifically romantic” pursuit, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped—her urgency lacks a counter-impulse that would deepen emotional complexity. Kael functions more as witness than crucible; his presence validates rather than pressures her choice. The final renunciation (“carry this with us, forever”) feels earned but leans on lyrical assertion over dramatized cost. Micro-choices are sparse; the hum-to-chant progression shows embodiment, yet no tangible sacrifice or trade-off is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal conflict—jealousy of past selves versus the need to reclaim agency—is embodied with specificity and emotional texture. Her micro-choice to close her eyes and drift into the dreamscape feels earned, not convenient. However, the epiphany arrives with slight diagnostic clarity (“you just forgot how to see it”) that edges toward label-speak, though it’s quickly redeemed by the scroll’s reconfiguration. The final act of writing carries visible cost: the relinquishment of envy for gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her loss of smell sharpens other senses without veering into diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation to “humanize the forgotten” arises organically from her own occluded perception and drives her engagement with Mira’s screw. The trembling calm in both women reflects a shared emotional grammar, not imposed symmetry. However, Mira’s backstory arrives as exposition rather than dramatized pressure, slightly flattening relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to transform scars into stories is vividly embodied through her trembling hands, crystallizing quill, and reflective micro-choices. Her internal conflict—between scholarly rationality and childhood superstition—is rendered with concrete specificity rather than diagnostic abstraction. The final renunciation of fear feels earned through prior causality, particularly her deliberate breathing and tactile engagement with the quill. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward tidy resolution, lacking deeper irrational contradiction in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular, especially in her embodied regret and tactile interaction with the perfume bottle. Her motivation—delivering an overdue apology—is consistent and intensifies under pressure from the orchard’s impending destruction. However, her emotional shift leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“imperfect miracles,” “mended but never quite whole”) that borders on label-speak without fully dramatizing the struggle beforehand. The final renunciation feels earned, though the internal contradiction could be more active than reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The witness’s motivation is conceptually clear but lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; their actions feel preordained rather than chosen under pressure. The “wanderingly exact” attribute remains a label without visible tradeoffs or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No emotional degradation or flawed perception under stress—only serene, diagnostic awareness. The final unification feels asserted, not earned through prior causality with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his obsession with time’s essence drives tactile engagement with the key and clock. His motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to revelation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing that forecloses his prior mechanical understanding. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal internal resistance or contradictory impulse; the shift leans slightly tidy for the high-band threshold. The final renunciation of mere measurement feels earned but lacks a visible behavioral cost beyond changed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and spatial cognition, but her emotional arc leans on inherited thematic language (“physics of letting go”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction. Her hesitation and eventual acceptance feel motivated, yet the “familiar stranger” epiphany arrives with minimal internal resistance, softening the cost of her shift. The father’s influence is poignant but risks bordering on diagnostic label-speak in peak moments (“struggled to grasp”). Still, her micro-choice to accept the mushroom credibly reconfigures her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied gestures—trembling fingers, tracing lantern edges—and her “theoretically rebellious yet pragmatic” nature fuels micro-choices that feel consistent and layered. Her emotional state avoids diagnostic labels, instead blooming through sensory immersion (“clover melancholy”). However, her final resolve arrives with minimal friction or visible cost beyond abstract realization, slightly undercutting the “felt cost” requirement for Earned Stasis. The father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eli’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his cultivated estrangement battles a gnawing loneliness, embodied in tactile details like the damp tunnel walls and the disc’s warmth. His micro-choices (not playing the disc, then finally blowing into it) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. The final call to a long-ignored number feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost in his exhaustion and vulnerability. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—preserving small moments—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her emotional state remains largely static, expressed through lyrical abstraction (“haunted euphoria”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The interaction with Mara reveals little tension or transformation in Elara herself; she functions more as a vessel for theme than a fully pressured agent. Interiority leans on stock phrasing (“weight of small moments,” “awaken the past”) without sufficient character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her “desperately jocular” shield against witnessed suffering feels authentic, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (touching the moon rock, stepping into decay) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the final epiphany leans slightly toward unearned clarity; the shift from shielded laughter to “genuine” joy lacks a concrete on-page tradeoff or cost that would fully earn the transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to map her own emotional depths—is compelling and consistent, rooted in her sensory gifts and blindness. Her interiority is concrete: emotions manifest as absorbed languages and vibrations, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle (her journey is smooth, obstacle-free) weakens psychological complexity. The final realization feels earned but lacks friction or cost beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “confidently uncertain” paradox is embodied through micro-choices (clutching the pen, stepping into the void) and consistent interiority, but her emotional arc lacks friction—her resolve never wavers under pressure, flattening internal conflict. The pen functions more as talisman than crucible, and no meaningful tradeoff or cost alters her tactics. Her motivation (“to uncover the truth”) remains abstract, untested by competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her desire to give voice to silence drives every gesture—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; it’s largely a monolithic yearning. Her embodiment through sign language and tactile interaction with the camera grounds her emotion, yet her epiphany feels slightly unearned because no prior beat shows her failing or doubting her method. The legacy-seeking renunciation is poignant but borders on diagnostic self-awareness (“I was here”) without sufficient struggle against an opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arsonist’s motivation—rescuing a forgotten promise—is clear and consistent, and their “volcanic tenderness” creates a compelling emotional register. However, interiority remains largely abstract (“analytically intuitive mind,” “fierce determination cloaked in delicate reverence”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The character acts with competence but lacks struggle or blind spots that would deepen credibility. Final tears feel earned thematically but arrive without prior emotional friction or cost-laden renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially in her drumming habit and emotional response to the lagoon. Her motivation—untangling implanted memories—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward purposeful action. However, her “quietly rebellious” trait remains largely declarative rather than demonstrated through micro-choices with tangible cost. The epiphany at the lagoon feels earned but leans slightly on lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s motivation—proving whispers outlast shouts—is compelling and tied to their unique trait of identifying walks, which grounds interiority in sensory specificity. Mira’s desperation is legible through her shifting gait, though her sudden appearance lacks sufficient setup to fully earn the relational crucible. The final choice (using the key) aligns with Eli’s quiet resolve, but Mira’s transformation feels slightly abrupt. Still, the protagonist’s arc from loneliness to shared purpose carries credible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian’s motivation is consistent and embodied through action, especially the use of the dental mirror and shutter-weaving. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped—“spiralingly calm” reads more as label than lived tension. The stranger’s arc feels earned, but their emotional shift leans slightly on unearned epiphany (“lighter, freer”) without sufficient micro-choices to ground it. Both characters remain archetypal rather than individuated, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clearly stated but remains abstract, lacking concrete micro-choices that reveal internal contradiction under pressure. His “ability to hear unspoken words” functions more as a label than an embodied trait shaping decisions with cost. The story summarizes his mission rather than dramatizing struggle or doubt in action. Final “pride and accomplishment” feels unearned due to absence of on-page resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her calloused hands, guarded heart, and ambivalence toward the "Swan" nickname reveal a nuanced self. Her motivation to embrace her true nature feels earned, not declared, and culminates in a credible renunciation (letting go of the scrimshaw) with visible emotional cost. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; it reads more as sequential yearning than active struggle. The final “combative tenderness” is resonant but slightly abstracted at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and morally textured, with grief embodied through tactile rituals (whittling, handling dried flowers). Her motivation—cultivating lightness in grief after her brother’s loss—is consistent and drives micro-choices (e.g., pressing wood to the window). However, her “blank face” risks becoming a static mask rather than a dynamic performance under pressure, slightly flattening emotional contradiction. The final resolve feels earned but leans on summary (“quiet resolve hardened”) rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation (“aesthetically driven,” desire to “stride through boundaries”) is consistent and embodied, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than contradictory in action. Emotions are rendered through lyrical sensation (“tremor of certainty,” “surrender”) without visceral contradiction or irrationality. The final transformation feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No secondary characters dilute focus, yet the single-POV interiority leans toward epiphany over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his colorblindness reframed as a lens, not a deficit—and his “innocently cunning” trait manifests in tangible barter rituals with plants. His final realization avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through embodied action (playing the concertina, painting). However, the glassblower’s late appearance lacks reciprocal pressure or status dynamics, flattening their relationship to thematic echo rather than crucible. The motivation shift post-phoenix is asserted more than dramatized, slightly weakening causal grounding for his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to recover lost human connection through sound. Her interiority is evocative but occasionally veers into abstract summary (“texture of connection”) rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional arc feels earned, though her epiphanies lean slightly diagnostic (“balance between innovation and humanity”). No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are absent—but within single-POV constraints, her micro-choices (activating the lens, listening deeply) align with her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—grief intertwined with devotion to her husband’s legacy—is consistent and embodied through tactile rituals (tracing the stencil, folding origami). Her internal conflict between paralysis and purpose manifests in micro-choices (e.g., never inking the vine until the climax). The final act of pressing the stencil to her skin feels earned, not epiphanic, though the emotional shift leans slightly tidy for a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” trait is embodied in her tactile engagement with cards and data, driving micro-choices that escalate stakes. Mira’s desperation feels authentic, though her backstory leans slightly on exposition. The relationship crystallizes under pressure, yielding a credible alliance. However, internal contradictions remain underexplored—Elara’s curiosity lacks counterweight, softening the cost of her obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied emotion (“breath caught,” “fingers tracing”) and credible contradiction—anguished yet joyful pursuit of knowledge. Her micro-choices (kneeling, whispering the word) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: erosion of innocence for understanding. However, her epiphany borders on diagnostic clarity (“mirror reflecting truths she carried within”), slightly undercutting the raw ambiguity expected under high stress.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and symbolic action, especially her tactile relationship with the river stone. Her motivation—preserving lost hope—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward the climax. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction; the “luminous regret” feels more declared than wrestled from conflicting impulses in-scene. Final choice is earned but lacks a visible tradeoff beyond abstract sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete sensory anchors, but her emotional arc leans on abstract summaries (“fragile convictions,” “layers of naivety”) rather than fully embodied contradictions in-scene. Her micro-choices—arranging tools, placing the tail tip—are resonant yet lack tangible stakes or trade-offs that would heighten cost. The chameleon functions more as symbol than catalyst for active decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation as a closure seeker is clear and consistent, and her telepathic bond with plants informs her choices. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her decisions feel linear rather than fraught. The epiphany about scars belonging to others arrives without sufficient prior friction or embodied struggle, leaning toward unearned insight. Her emotional progression is lyrical but borders on tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—searching for where unused love is stored—is idiosyncratic yet grounded in her psychometric practice, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels. Her final decision to take the film strip feels earned through embodied reactions (trembling hands, tracing edges) and micro-choices under pressure. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: the shift from curiosity to purpose lacks a contradictory impulse acting *in scene*. The cost of carrying this repository is felt but not dramatized as a tangible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—freeing trapped creativity—is consistent and deeply personal, rooted in her sensory communion with the cosmos. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“breath visible in the crisp air,” “aurora’s song pulsed through her veins”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she experiences longing but no active resistance or competing desire that pressures a choice. The absence of a micro-choice with visible cost undercuts full Earned Stasis eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her goal to cultivate sparks. However, interiority remains largely abstract (“felt its weight as a reminder,” “something she couldn’t yet name”) without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final understanding feels earned but not deeply conflicted—more epiphany than struggle. Her “dreamless” state is stated but never tested or shown to limit her perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eamon’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion and a clear hierarchy of values revealed through micro-choices (e.g., following the wind’s song despite disorientation). His motivation intensifies credibly, and the final realization feels earned by prior struggle. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward unearned clarity—his “roar” of insight borders on diagnostic label-speak (“clarity he had never known”) without sufficient on-page friction to fully ground it. The absence of secondary characters simplifies relational pressure but doesn’t harm single-POV execution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“clutched the ticket,” “leash had broken”), and her motivation—seeking unused courage—is consistent and compelling. The ferryman functions more as a symbolic guide than a fully pressurizing secondary character, limiting relational depth. Her final act (punching the air) feels earned by prior emotional buildup, though the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between duty and discovery, silence and expression—is rendered through embodied stillness and hesitant action. His motivation (“to understand the cost of safety”) is consistent and intensifies credibly toward his choice to play. However, the epiphany upon touching the bolt borders on diagnostic label-speak (“fear—fear of what lay beyond its walls”), slightly flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her resolve mirrored in iron gall ink, her stature contrasted with her weighty mission. Her micro-choices (leaving messages, carving runes) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The pretender’s presence forces credible emotional layering—defiance met with calm certainty—not tidy resolution. However, the climax lacks internal contradiction; Elara never wavers, missing an opportunity for deeper moral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied habits like rhythmic tapping grounding her emotional processing. Her motivation—to understand vanished paths—emerges organically from her role as a coral bleaching witness and ties to the torn atlas. However, her final realization leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“Some paths disappear because we stop walking them”) without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene to earn full complexity. The cost of her insight is felt but not dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet, opera glasses, and tactile interaction with the stone circle ground her emotional state. Her “awkward confidence” reads as a lived contradiction, not a label. However, the epiphany via cosmic vision risks unearned transcendence; the shift from doubt to resolve leans on external mysticism rather than internal struggle. The final choice feels resonant but slightly under-pressured by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and grounded—her fear and reverence for the embryo, her conflicted loyalty to tradition, and her bodily awareness (“ache in her joints,” “fingers trembled”) feel authentic. Her micro-choices (decoding the script despite danger, pressing the embryo to the kite) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, the guard’s abrupt departure slightly undercuts the relational pressure that could have deepened her moral calculus. The final transformation feels earned but leans on plant whispers rather than internal contradiction alone.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zara’s interiority is embodied and consistent, with trauma shaping her perception and micro-choices—especially during the cliff-edge moment. Her quiet talent and grief are shown through action (sketching, clutching the photo), not summary. However, the epiphany about “pearl of stillness” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing, bordering on therapy-speak without sufficient prior textual grounding. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but a shift in stance—credible, yet the cost feels implied rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with contradictions evident in her trembling hands versus her instinctive card-sorting. Her motivation—to descend into darkness to reclaim creativity—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices like abandoning the box for a pile. However, the epiphany arrives with slight diagnostic clarity (“luminescent ache… no longer felt like pain but like possibility”) that edges toward label-speak, undercutting full emotional messiness. The final renunciation of control feels earned, though the transformation leans slightly tidy for the depth of despair established.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—grief-driven quest to understand her brother’s death—is clear and consistent, compelling her high-stakes pursuit of the ink. Her interiority is embodied (“anger, though serene on the surface, burned deep”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of control for understanding feels earned by prior causality, with visible emotional cost in her tears and transformed resolve. However, the secondary character remains underdeveloped beyond thematic function, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is clearly rendered through embodied reactions (“fingers trembled,” “hands shook”) and micro-choices (breaking the seal, copying data), but her motivation leans on label-like phrasing (“bravely conflicted”) without fully dramatizing the contradiction in action. The final choice feels earned yet lacks a decisive trade-off beyond abstract dread. Her professional identity as archivist informs stakes but doesn’t concretely shape tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifism and legacy conflict are clearly established, and her micro-choice to accept Kael’s blade reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—she resolves the dilemma too cleanly without showing visceral struggle in the moment. The “senselessly perceptive” trait remains descriptive rather than active, failing to generate embodied cost or flawed perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to catch the goddess’s echo—is consistent and emotionally grounded, and his cool-headedness informs his deliberate movements. His interiority is filtered through sensory perception (“emotions transliterated into actions”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, his final dialogue (“to know what it means to be both wild and still”) leans toward abstract articulation rather than embodied contradiction, slightly undercutting emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her journalistic ethos, and her observant nature drives key actions. However, internal conflict remains largely summarized (“orbits of regret,” “solemn playfulness”) rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final recalibration feels symbolic but lacks a tangible trade-off or cost that reconfigures her options beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her guilt manifests through tactile details (steady yet weary hands, the amber’s glow) and micro-choices (writing as the lost child). Her flaw directly drives the central action, and her final shift feels earned through incremental emotional labor. However, the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than fully dramatized struggle; the firmware’s softening borders on external validation rather than internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s whimsical yet perceptive nature is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the mandala and tile flake, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation—to find meaning in chaos—is dramatized through active choices (interjecting the flake, whispering a question) that escalate under pressure. The internal contradiction between her desire for clarity and acceptance of ambiguity culminates in an Earned Stasis: she endures the “mess” without resolution. However, the emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered with concrete sensory cues (ash on tesserae, acrid air), and her motivation—to “cradle empathy in arms of steel”—is consistent and embodied in action. However, her “retrocognitive” trait functions more as atmospheric label than a driver of contradictory impulses in-scene; the flashback to the fire summarizes rather than dramatizes conflict. Her radicalism remains abstract, lacking micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under tangible pressure. The final act of rearranging tiles feels symbolic but lacks friction or cost that would ground her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through synesthetic perception and embodied emotion, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to lure possibility from despair—is consistent and intensifies into a meaningful act of connection. The encounter with her past self creates credible internal conflict, though the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The micro-choice to offer the coin carries visible emotional cost and reveals her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through somatic markers and embodied unease, avoiding therapy-speak. Her contradictory impulses—skepticism versus affection—operate simultaneously in scene, notably when she presses the geode to her chest while doubting its efficacy. However, the final choice feels slightly under-pressured; the cost of creating the light painting remains abstract rather than viscerally felt, weakening the “visible cost” requirement for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation intensifies credibly from data-driven curiosity to mythic stewardship, and her micro-choices (extracting the fossil, following its float) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional flood upon touching the fossil leans into diagnostic label-speak (“joy, sorrow, longing, and wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance feels earned but lacks a visible cost—she gains purpose without loss. Interiority remains consistent yet borders on over-articulated in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to recover lost wisdom, and her actions align with that drive. Interiority is concrete—her trembling hands, focused sorting—but lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; her competence borders on frictionless. The bone button discovery feels intuitive rather than earned through flawed effort. Final choice to carry the echo forward is credible but cost remains abstract, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, with clear contradictions between caution and residual daring. Her motivation—fixing what’s broken—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., resisting the pill). However, the epiphany about courage being “remembered” borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient prior dramatization of that specific cognitive shift. The final renunciation of the pill feels earned but leans slightly abstract in its emotional calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to “distill complexity into essence,” and his internal arc culminates in a credible conceptual realization. His embodiment—rough hands, ambient awareness, grip on the needle—is specific and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; he experiences no palpable struggle or misbelief corrected by events. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond abstract understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her zen-minded curiosity, and her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses—her calmness remains unchallenged even as stakes rise, flattening internal conflict. The shift from personal inquiry to communal teaching feels abrupt without micro-choices dramatizing the pivot. Her epiphany about kindness reads more as received wisdom than earned insight through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” nature is embodied through her gardening and handling of the lockmaster’s tooth, revealing internal contradiction between hope and realism. Her micro-choices—descending the fire escape, offering the tooth—align with her motivation and carry emotional weight. The lockmaster remains underdeveloped beyond his function as mirror to Elara, but their brief interaction suffices for this length. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are grounded in tactile detail (e.g., “fingers brushing against the lockmaster’s tooth”).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motivation—to translate isolation into independence—is vividly rooted in her lineage and reincarnation memory, driving concrete action (descent into the library, use of the sundial). Her internal conflict between scholarly solitude and ancestral duty manifests through embodied choices, not abstraction. However, the epiphany at the orb feels slightly too seamless; the “brittle awakenings” prepare her, but the transformation lacks a visible stumble or resistance that would ground the leap from recluse to embodiment. The final renunciation of mere guardianship is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a “keeper of secrets,” but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves with serene purpose without meaningful resistance or struggle. Her final act (leaving the spiral) carries emotional weight but no visible cost or foreclosed path, undermining Earned Stasis. The whimsical trait is stated rather than dramatized through flawed choice. Interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction (“unspoken threads that bound people together”) rather than character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her expertise in celestial patterns drives her to decode the signal—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from caution to resolve without meaningful hesitation or self-doubt that would deepen her humanity. Her “grit” feels asserted rather than dramatized through layered emotion or embodied struggle under stress. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is credible but leans on declaration (“she had something they didn’t: grit”) rather than micro-choices that foreclose alternatives with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied through tactile reactions (brushing debris, trembling fingers) and micro-choices that narrow her options under pressure. Her internal conflict—yearning vs. caution—is simultaneous, not alternating, and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses retreat. However, the epiphany about the organ as “language” leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of how she deciphers it, softening the final turn’s causality.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s face blindness and methodical artistry cohere as defining traits that shape perception and action, not just labels. Her internal contradiction—seeking connection through an inability to recognize faces—is embodied in her focus on intent over appearance during the quarry encounter. The lancing tool and ribbon fragments function as extensions of her psyche, grounding motivation in tactile choices. However, her emotional shift at the end leans slightly toward unearned epiphany rather than struggle-born realization.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“spongey dread,” “nervously confident”—and her micro-choices (deciphering journals, pressing the nail) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to honor her great-uncle—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, the final choice lacks sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene; it arrives as resolve without visible internal struggle, slightly undercutting the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Bridge-Song’s motivation is vividly rendered through their obsession with the hitchhiker’s disappearance and the glass flake, but interiority leans toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The phrase “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” functions more as lyrical mantra than psychologically grounded impulse. Micro-choices (tracing land contours like a fiddle tune) show character-specific perception, yet emotional stakes lack friction—no visible cost or struggle impedes progress. Final stance feels earned thematically but not through tangible sacrifice or error.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s calmness and curiosity feel consistent, and his micro-choices—like dissuading the scavenger—reveal values. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; motivation leans on inherited mystery rather than active struggle. The epiphany about “paths circling back” arrives cleanly but borders on unearned without deeper resistance or flawed missteps. His passivity in discovery (reading, observing) slightly undermines agency expected at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, rooted in healing fractured memories through her gift with words. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead, it unfolds as a linear progression toward epiphany. The emotional arc feels earned but leans on abstract self-awareness (“acknowledging the burdens she had carried in silence”) rather than embodied struggle. Her transformation is credible but softened by absence of tangible resistance or flawed missteps.

    Eira’s interior contradiction—warlike serenity masking vulnerability—is embodied through clenched hands, fluid dance, and the whispered confession. Her motivation (“to discover what mirrors don’t show”) intensifies under pressure and drives her unbending, culminating in a credible emotional shift. The frozen confession functions as both lake’s secret and her buried guilt, making the epiphany feel earned. However, the transition from guardedness to surrender leans slightly on abstract phrasing (“defenses crumbling”) rather than fully physicalized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (“to find the intersection of dreams”) and trait (“purposefully curious”) are stated but not dramatized through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her scars and clipping link her to the maze, yet her emotional arc lacks embodied struggle—decisions feel preordained rather than earned through conflict. The “anxious elation” recurs as label-speak without sensory grounding or contradictory impulses in scene. Final renunciation or endurance is absent; she succeeds cleanly, minimizing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “fiercely gentle” hands, the tremor beneath steady speech—and her recklessness is tempered by reverence, creating credible contradiction. Her choice to stay is earned through consistent micro-choices (planting seeds, carving walls) that reveal a hierarchy of values: meaning over freedom. The doppelgänger confrontation crystallizes her flaw as devotion without self-preservation, and her renunciation carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (“brushing dirt,” “tug—a trammel”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile engagement with the speaker cloth, his reliance on facts as emotional armor—but his final shift leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak (“insulate himself not with facts, but with hope”). The contradiction between craving purpose and resisting vulnerability is present, yet the epiphany arrives with minimal friction or micro-choice under pressure. His roadie-to-appraiser backstory informs his worldview credibly, though the failure at auction remains abstract rather than dramatized. A tighter link between his professional flaw and a specific misjudgment would have elevated motivation to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her trembling hands, yearning heart, and methodical caution reveal contradictory impulses in scene. Her haunted ambitions drive tangible choices (planting the seed), and her epiphany feels earned through struggle, not declaration. However, the mentor’s spirit appears only as a passive vision, limiting relational depth. The final peace arrives with credible emotional cost: the release of obsession into purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (“wintersun serenity that warmed her despite the chill”) and micro-choices (retrieving the orb, kneeling by the pool) that reveal her values under pressure. Her motivation—to preserve wonder in routine—is dramatized through action, not summary. However, her epiphany about identity as “a dance of light and shadow” leans slightly toward abstract reflection without sufficient prior struggle or contradiction in-scene. The final renunciation of fixed identity feels earned but lacks a tangible cost beyond conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation shifts credibly from professional duty to spiritual calling, grounded in tactile interaction with the pearl and crown. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels but leans on familiar archetypes (“bridge,” “conduit”) without sufficient contradiction or struggle. The final choice feels earned yet lacks a visible cost—her transformation is seamless, not fraught. For a story this short, that absence of friction undercuts full character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, clarity, and fractured hope manifest through tactile interactions with the accordion and maps. Her motivation (self-forgiveness) intensifies believably, driving micro-choices like playing a mournful note or unfolding her self-drawn map. The brief encounter with the old acquaintance avoids sentimentality and sharpens her internal shift. However, the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany without fully dramatizing the cost of her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The veiled dreamer’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a yearning for unspoken truths, and her internal conflict between fear and hope is embodied through physical cues (breath, grip on the watch). However, her transformation lacks concrete contradiction in-scene—her resolve emerges cleanly without visible struggle or flawed missteps that would deepen interiority. The final choice feels earned but not hard-won; the cost of becoming a conduit remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her telepathy with plants, mulberry ache, and coffee-stain divination feel character-particular. Her motivation (dream vs. empire) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a decisive act with visible cost: the violin’s destruction and lingering ache. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves cleanly from doubt to resolve without hesitation that would deepen psychological realism. The final choice is earned, but the emotional struggle feels streamlined rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to preserve beauty against oblivion, but her internal contradiction—between capturing sparks and embracing stillness—is underdeveloped until the traveler’s arrival. Her micro-choices (e.g., pressing the emerald chip) reveal values, yet the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany rather than earned struggle. The traveler functions more as oracle than crucible, limiting relational pressure. Still, her final renunciation of control feels credible within the story’s lyrical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered with embodied emotion (“quiet unrest lingered in her heart, a yearning she couldn’t name”) and micro-choices (climbing trees, retrieving the pin) that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, her transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her forgiveness and quest feel linear rather than conflicted. The epiphany at the lake borders on diagnostic (“cycle of rebirth was not just about endings…”) without sufficient struggle en route. Her flaw—trusting too deeply—is stated but not dramatized as an active limitation during key decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is conceptually rich but leans on diagnostic phrasing (“conscience for hire,” “sincerely insincere”) that borders on label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation—to welcome nuance—is consistent but expressed more as thesis than visceral struggle. The shard and chimes serve as externalized symbols rather than pressure points forcing micro-choices with cost. Final renunciation (sending the letter) lacks a dramatized trade-off, weakening emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between withholding and revealing—is rendered with concrete embodiment (stone-throwing, tactile memory) and credible emotional layering. Her backwards aging is not just a gimmick but a lived condition that shapes her choices and fears. However, the final renunciation leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“the courage to reveal”) rather than fully embodied contradiction under peak stress, softening the cost’s rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and consistent worldview, yet their motivation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—choices feel preordained rather than contested. The “harmonic stone skimmer” identity informs action but doesn’t generate friction or trade-offs under pressure. Final renunciation of external movement for internal stillness is thematically coherent but not dramatized as a costly refusal with competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent yearning for authenticity, but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his struggle reads more as persistent failure than active tension between opposing desires. His emotional embodiment is adequate (“breath crystallized,” “trembling hands”), yet the epiphany at the keystone feels slightly unearned, bordering on diagnostic (“the sacred could be found in the simplest of acts”). The final choice reflects endurance rather than transformation, which fits Earned Stasis, but the cost—social irrelevance—is stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in longing and curiosity—is consistent and embodied, especially through tactile interactions with the key tag and books. His vow feels earned by prior sensory immersion and quiet yearning, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than active. The final choice carries conceptual cost (commitment to an abstract quest), but lacks a tangible sacrifice that would elevate it to 9+. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains grounded in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as a “cast lots decision maker,” but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her doubts are stated rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses. Her micro-choices (selecting coins, initiating distillation) align with purpose but feel ritualistic rather than pressured. The shift from “quietly enthusiastic” to “beacon of hope” is declared more than earned through struggle. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“wavelength align with purpose”).

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief and motivation are embodied with specificity—her dulled scythe, trembling voice, tactile interaction with the atlas—and her internal contradiction (duty vs. love) fuels credible micro-choices. The naming act is a renunciation of passive mourning, foreclosing emotional stasis with visible cost. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the shift from heartbreak to purpose lacks intermediate friction that would fully earn the final stance under high-band scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliard’s earnest naivety and devotion are embodied through tactile actions—scrubbing the bell, crafting alloy—and his internal contradiction (fragile hope vs. cosmic despair) is consistent. However, his emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path; his persistence feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The ancestral reflection is well-anchored but doesn’t tilt a present stance via micro-decision. Final trembling hands show emotion but not a reconfigured hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—spinning forgotten stories into shared meaning—is consistent and rooted in his role as a “precisely humane” guardian, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His emotional progression is credible yet leans toward tidy resolution; the absence of genuine struggle or blind spots softens the cost of his choices. The liqueur label catalyzes action without forcing a difficult trade-off, reducing the felt weight of his endurance. Still, his micro-choices (gathering photos, mounting an exhibit) reveal values with modest on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between logic and intuition is consistent and embodied, particularly in her hesitation before the altar. However, her sentimental trait remains largely declarative—“secretly sentimental” is stated but never shown through a micro-choice with cost. The final transformation feels earned by atmosphere more than causal interior struggle; her epiphany lacks friction from prior contradictory actions. A stronger beat showing sentiment overriding logic (or vice versa) would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The seeker’s interiority is atmospheric but leans on abstract labels like “watcher’s burden” and “attentively inventive” without embodying contradictory impulses in action. Motivation (“preserve trust under pressure”) is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices with visible trade-offs. The parachute buckle triggers memory, but the character’s struggle lacks specific, flawed decision-making under stress. Final endurance feels earned thematically but not causally grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to defeat emotional numbness—is clear and embodied in trembling hands and the duel’s choreography. However, internal conflict remains abstractly summarized (“fear, anger, sadness, joy—they came in waves”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in real time. The clone brain functions more as metaphor than a psychologically specific mirror, weakening interiority. Final integration feels earned but leans on diagnostic phrasing (“vivification of their soul”) that edges into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to safeguard a space for innovation—is credibly embodied in his ritualistic planting and later actions, and his receptivity to mystery feels consistent. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; choices proceed with near-total certainty, flattening emotional complexity. The final step into the chamber reads as curiosity-driven endurance rather than a renunciation with cost, weakening the Earned Stasis potential. His character remains vivid but leans toward archetype without sufficient friction between desire and limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, but his interiority leans on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The “mournfully eager” trait is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. His actions align with his goal, yet the emotional progression lacks irrationality or self-deception—key for high-band characterization. The final smile feels earned, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to make friends with uncertainty—is embodied in her tactile connection to the garden and crystallized in her final choice to wait. Her internal conflict between homesickness and duty feels lived-in, not abstract, though her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“dimensionally homesick,” “method of interiorizing exteriors”) that borders on label-speak. The keeper functions effectively as a mirror rather than a full secondary character, applying precise pressure without muddying focus. Her renunciation is earned, with clear cost: enduring longing while protecting the library.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s stoic sensitivity is embodied through tactile gestures—clutching the crozier, trembling hands—and her internal contradiction between disillusionment and flickering defiance feels authentic. However, the epiphany (“the penny drop”) arrives with minimal friction; her shift from failure to resolve lacks a visible micro-choice that forgoes an alternative path. The frozen bloom memory functions more as emblem than catalyst, reducing the cost of her transformation. Her final smile reads earned but slightly smoothed of the grit expected from years of ash-laden failure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“fingers brushing,” “hum in response to the moon’s proximity”). Her micro-choices—discarding assumptions—reveal a hierarchy of values, though her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; it unfolds sequentially rather than in tension. The epiphany feels earned by prior struggle, yet borders on diagnostic (“silence was not the absence of sound”) without sufficient irrationality or self-deception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her resilience shapes key decisions, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped—her positivity never truly fractures or costs her anything visible until the climax. The transient interaction offers a glimmer of relational pressure, yet Mara’s emotional state remains remarkably stable, bordering on unearned stoicism. Her micro-choice to hand over the hourglass shows generosity, but the cost isn’t felt until after the fact, weakening immediacy. Still, her actions align tightly with her goal, and the final endurance reads as credible within the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “fever dream architect,” and her internal conflict—between fear of unraveling and desire for connection—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., resuming weaving despite risk). The shadow-man interaction crystallizes her stakes without melodrama. However, her emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany over earned transformation; the “texture of connection” feels asserted more than dramatized through layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a navigation instructor, with clear interiority around loss of direction in a changed world. Her “balancedly curious” trait manifests in micro-choices (e.g., mounting the chain link, blending star charts with alien data). However, Kael functions more as exposition than crucible—his presence doesn’t force Elara into a morally or emotionally fraught dilemma, weakening relational pressure. The final renunciation isn’t costly enough; she succeeds without meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her role as a “contact tracer for hearts” grounds her actions—but interior contradiction is underdeveloped. Her curiosity drives her, yet we see little struggle or ambiguity in her choices. Emotions are embodied (“fingers trembled,” “breath catching”), but remain largely unconflicted. The final renunciation (“incidental heroism”) is thematically resonant but lacks a tangible cost that forecloses a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s claustrophobia is embodied and woven into her micro-choices, especially when she presses forward despite panic. Her motivation—honoring Dr. Voss—is consistent and emotionally grounded, though the internal contradiction (fear vs. duty) occasionally leans toward summary rather than simultaneous tension. The final endurance feels earned, with a visible cost in psychological toll. However, the emotional shift at the end lacks granular struggle; her calm arrives slightly too smoothly for the depth of her established phobia.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a visceral contradiction: she is alive despite official records declaring her dead. Her interiority is concrete—heartbeat counting, tactile engagement with the shard—and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The ghost as an echo of her lost self deepens internal conflict without resolution, and her final earned stasis (“survivor of the system”) forecloses passive victimhood with visible cost. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between desire and action during the defragmentation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—saving her dying language—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she trembles yet never wavers, flattening emotional complexity. Her copper veins and tactile connection to the diamond ground her uniqueness, but her choices feel preordained rather than wrestled from competing impulses. The cost of her sacrifice is visible (collapsing, fading veins), yet the struggle reads as endurance without moral or psychological friction. A stronger interior conflict—e.g., doubt about the diamond’s curse versus ancestral duty—would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motivation is vividly rendered through embodied action and a credible emotional arc, culminating in laughter that feels earned rather than epiphanic. Her bitterness and scientific obsession are concretely grounded, though the transition from grief to cosmic acceptance leans slightly abstract at the climax. The cryptid functions more as symbol than character, limiting relational depth—but within single-POV constraints, her internal contradiction (control vs. surrender) drives meaningful micro-choices. Final renunciation of control carries felt cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—reawakening beauty through music—is embodied in her trembling hands, heartbeat sync, and decisive choice to press the shell to her chest. Her internal conflict (knowing vs. understanding) manifests physically and musically, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final act of endurance carries visible cost: the inert shell, symbolizing expended hope. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves steadily from doubt to resolution without credible regression or hypocrisy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in his sister’s disappearance and his quiet defiance. His interiority is concrete—embodied in trembling hands, murmured words, and micro-choices like activating Luma despite risk. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the sorrow/hope balance feels calibrated rather than contradictory under peak stress. The final renunciation (walking away while others reconcile) is credible but lacks a sharper, character-specific flaw that complicates his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The carpenter’s motivation—to interpret silence as possibility—is consistent and embodied through his tactile engagement with wood and the halo fragment. His internal conflict (voicelessness vs. creative expression) remains implicit but legible, culminating in a credible emotional shift. However, his transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; the decision to sing arrives without visible struggle or trade-off, weakening the cost of his epiphany. The final stance feels earned thematically but not causally within the scene’s compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her longing for analog authenticity, and her “sanely eccentric” nature manifests through precise micro-choices (e.g., arranging books geometrically). Her internal contradiction—between scientific rigor and poetic faith—is embodied without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (“guardian… one book at a time”) feels earned, though the emotional cost of protecting a fading realm remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—her longing for a lost dream drives her ritualistic art. Interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and embodied emotion (“fingers traced the contours,” “air felt heavier”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her final realization—“not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew”—edges toward unearned epiphany; the shift lacks sufficient friction or contradictory impulses in-scene to fully earn the transformation. Her flaws remain abstract rather than actively complicating choices.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with micro-choices (e.g., whispering her mother’s phrase) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, and emotions are embodied through tactile details like the lock of hair and trembling hands. However, the final release lacks a visible cost—she emerges “unchanged,” undercutting the promised stakes of fear versus freedom. The idea’s fragility is noted but not tested against Elara’s own flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering stolen memories—is clear and personal, and her chronic curiosity drives action. Interiority is grounded in sensory detail (e.g., cool mushroom texture, trembling hands), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves linearly from curiosity to revelation without meaningful internal resistance or trade-offs that would deepen credibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, backwards walking, and “combative tenderness” reveal a complex psyche under pressure. Her motivation to mentor resilience is credible and rooted in lived scars, not abstraction. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive internal contradiction during the climax; she steadies too smoothly, missing a moment where fear and resolve truly war. The final resolve feels earned but slightly tidy given the high stakes of “reversible exile.”

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in preserving wonder, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her creativity and wisdom feel harmonized rather than contested. Emotions are embodied through tactile orchard work, yet peak moments rely on lyrical abstraction (“radiant hush”) over specific physiological sensation. The final choice feels earned, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; no path is truly foreclosed, only affirmed. Her “insatiably creative” trait functions more as label than driver of difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, breath catching, and tactile engagement with the net reveal layered grief without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation ties cleanly to her shattered mask backstory, and her final endurance (Earned Stasis) forecloses emotional avoidance at visible cost. However, her internal conflict remains slightly abstracted in places (“lucid unrest,” “grappling with weight”) rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The climax leans on whispered voices rather than a decisive action that tests her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are consistent, grounded in “methodically curious” traits and empathy for silence. Her actions—comparing footage, excavating deliberately—align with her worldview. However, internal conflict remains underexplored; she faces no meaningful resistance or self-doubt that tests her “shielded openness.” The discovery feels preordained rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is consistently embodied through her actions (tracing the globe, reading the journal, following the map) and culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. Her quietly analytic nature informs every micro-choice without slipping into diagnostic label-speak. The relationship with Death remains evocative but distant, avoiding over-explanation while deepening thematic resonance. Final placement of the snow globe enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she releases the very object anchoring her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—giving voice to the voiceless—is consistent and rooted in her identity as a “seldom-heard balladeer,” which intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“driftingly alert,” attuned to storm whispers) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final choice to release the ghost is earned through prior causality, with visible cost: solitude after connection. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and her warmly inquisitive nature informs her actions, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped—she moves steadily without meaningful resistance or missteps. Her emotional shift at the climax feels earned by accumulation rather than struggle, and the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“understanding her own heart”) rather than embodied revelation. The goggles and diary function more as symbols than pressure points that force flawed choices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her cloud-emotion taxonomy and tactile engagement with the telescope, grounding her epiphany in established character logic. Her leap feels earned because it emerges from her belief system, not external pressure. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, and the “quietly explosive” trait remains more descriptive than dramatized in action. The final renunciation—accepting her role as sky-keeper—is credible but lacks a visible sacrifice beyond temporal dislocation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s face blindness and fractal perception are vividly embodied, shaping her actions and worldview with specificity. Her motivation—to mirror the sky within walls—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in tactile detail (e.g., tracing bark, trembling hands). However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than simultaneous; her struggle leans more toward focused obsession than conflicting impulses acting at once.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her curiosity manifests through tactile engagement with the phrasebook and hopscotch board. Her emotional arc from isolation to connection feels earned, rooted in micro-choices like following the light beam. However, her “diligently curious” trait borders on label-only without deeper contradiction or cost until the end. The final smile resolves cleanly but lacks a visible trade-off that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a locksmith seeking repair—not just of objects but of time and prophecy. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied actions (trembling hands, breath visible in cold) rather than diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to enter the hall of mirrors feels earned by prior curiosity and longing, and the cost—confronting fractured selves—is felt without being overstated. However, internal contradiction remains subtle rather than simultaneous, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motivation stems from personal history and communal need, but interiority lacks contradiction or embodied struggle. Secondary characters function as archetypes (botanist, sculptor, musician) without individualized pressure or meaningful friction. Elara’s “altruistic ghost” role is static—she observes but never wrestles with doubt, cost, or limitation. The resolution feels cooperative rather than earned through character-specific sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, blood mingling with porcelain—and her motivation (“to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes”) compels credible micro-choices. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she wavers only briefly before resolve returns. The mentor’s remembered advice functions more as thematic reinforcement than a catalyst for struggle. Final endurance feels earned but slightly streamlined for the story’s high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—duty, rebellion, hope—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (whispering to trees, pocketing the nut). Her internal conflict between resentment and responsibility manifests in micro-choices: staying despite hatred, risking safety for travelers. The final renunciation of passive caretaking is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in isolation and danger. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through soil, frost, and mechanical birds.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and profession-inflected (“symphonically attuned to molecular bonds”), and her grief feels embodied rather than abstract. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal friction—her transformation hinges on a single insight without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The chrysalis functions more as symbol than catalyst for active choice, and “atonement” remains conceptual rather than dramatized through micro-decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her quest to mend fragmented narratives. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through precise actions like tracing the vial with her blade—and reveals a hierarchy of values (story over safety). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves with unwavering purpose, missing internal friction that would deepen credibility. The final choice feels earned but costless, undermining the "felt cost" requirement for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to “sandpaper rough memories”—is vividly embodied through her synesthetic gift and consistent micro-choices (e.g., pressing her palm to jagged etchings). Her internal contradiction—drawn to pain yet seeking to soften it—is rendered without therapy-speak, and her emotional arc culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses her prior sorrow. The backstory brush with contagious remorse is efficiently anchored to present action. However, the final transformation of personal regret feels slightly compressed, lacking a visible trade-off beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her empathetically decisive nature informs her actions. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves from resolve to success without meaningful struggle or doubt. Mr. Kovar’s arc is underdeveloped; his transformation feels declarative rather than earned through interaction. The story leans on label-speak (“empathetically decisive,” “tender yet vigorous”) without dramatizing the tension between those impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—“chaotically precise,” torn between engineering rigor and archaeological longing—but her transformation leans on summary (“profound transformation,” “spark reignite”) rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final vow feels earned thematically but lacks a decisive, costly action that forecloses an alternative path. Her flaw (over-attachment to memory) doesn’t generate a tangible mistake; instead, it’s aestheticized. Still, her embodied focus on the mirror and moonlit gestures ground her emotions credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her prism-minded trait informs her perception and decisions. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her drive feels singular rather than layered. Emotions are embodied (“heart pounding,” “fingers trembling”) but verge on familiar phrasing. The final choice is earned, though the cost (“responsibility”) remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her unique perception and empathy, and her interiority is rendered through tactile, sensory language rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward revelation without internal resistance or doubt, flattening the psychological stakes. The hedgehog functions as ambiance, not pressure, so no secondary character challenges her choices. Her final trembling hands signal cost, but it’s atmospheric rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her exile stems from principled dissent, and her chess-based method reveals interiority through action. However, her emotional arc leans on abstract declarations (“discover beauty in the difficult”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The worry stone and knight symbolize resilience but lack micro-choices that force trade-offs; her epiphany arrives as realization, not renunciation with visible cost. Final resolve feels earned thematically but lacks the visceral friction required for 9+ characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her pacifist, empathetic worldview, and her actions align with her goal to understand silence. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward resolution without meaningful resistance or struggle. Emotions are embodied but verge on lyrical abstraction (“heart ached with longing”) rather than visceral contradiction. The final choice feels earned but costless; no path is foreclosed, only embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory gift are well-established, and her internal shift feels earned. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal friction—her contradiction between striving and presence is stated more than dramatized through active choice under pressure. The final realization lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a tangible path; instead, it’s a passive reception of wisdom. This weakens the cost legibility required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her emotional arc aligns with the planet’s stakes, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The final choice feels earned, yet lacks micro-choices under pressure that reveal contradictory impulses in-scene. Her resilience emerges more as realization than struggle, missing tactile evidence of cost during the gravity inversion or grove confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans toward diagnostic summary (“rapidly adapting mind,” “cultivate foresight in action”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her emotional response to the patch feels reverent but generic; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The engineer’s backstory remains externalized, limiting character-driven cost. Still, her professional lens grounds perception credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—certifying wonder as essential—is vividly rooted in personal history and shapes her actions, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; fear is mentioned but not actively wrestling with courage in-scene. Her synesthetic perception is distinctive, yet emotional embodiment leans toward lyrical abstraction (“heart swelling with knowledge”) rather than visceral contradiction. The final choice feels earned, though the cost of unfettering hope remains conceptual rather than physically or relationally tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—fear and determination alternate rather than collide. Her micro-choices (e.g., playing the flute despite trauma) are credible, yet the emotional embodiment leans on summary (“hands trembled,” “heart pounding”) without idiosyncratic physicality. The backstory block (crystal orb disaster) is well-anchored by present cues but slightly exceeds BRR allowance without altering immediate tactics. Flaws are present but safety-hedged; her competence isn’t meaningfully tested mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially during the empathy surge (“breath coming in ragged gasps”), and his borrowed-personality trait adds texture. However, his transformation feels slightly too tidy—emotional complexity resolves into a clear epiphany without sufficient contradictory resistance in-scene. The final renunciation of masks as “threads” is resonant but borders on diagnostic label-speak (“expanding boundaries”) rather than fully dramatized struggle. Still, micro-choices (touching the fragment, stumbling back) reveal values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s jitteriness and emotional embodiment feel specific and consistent, especially in her tactile relationship with the pendant. Her internal conflict—between duty and doubt, Alaric’s absence and her own agency—is credibly rendered without diagnostic labels. The final choice to accept the relic’s call feels earned through micro-choices (lingering touch, hesitation at the door). However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her trembling hands, steady breath, and tactile engagement with the prism reveal interiority without diagnostic label-speak. Her epiphany feels earned through sensory communion rather than abstract theorizing. However, her emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; grief is received but not wrestled with, reducing complexity. The final renunciation (“work was far from over”) shows credible endurance but minimal visible cost beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—carrying a message across impossible distance—is consistent and deepens as pressure mounts, culminating in a credible renunciation of her home. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers, calloused yet nimble,” “wondered if it held the key”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; choices feel sequential rather than fraught with competing desires. The bead’s glow and puzzle discovery compel action, but emotional struggle remains understated at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli’s quiet determination and internal conflict are grounded in concrete action—his forge work, cautious approach to the stranger, and deliberate descent—but his “awakening” lacks embodied specificity, veering toward abstract transformation. The cost of his barter is felt emotionally but not physically or socially on the page. His meekness contrasts effectively with his resolve, yet the final shift (“more and less himself”) risks diagnostic vagueness without a tangible micro-choice that manifests this duality. Still, his motivation is consistent and stakes-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, but her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“weight of a withheld truth,” “sensory maps”) without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The encounter with her double lacks tension—dialogue delivers exposition rather than forcing a difficult decision. Her final acceptance feels earned thematically but not causally; no visible cost or renunciation accompanies her new role.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s reticence and observational nature are embodied consistently, and his micro-choices (touching sea glass, rearranging stones) reveal internal stakes. However, his shift from passive observer to active protector lacks a clear contradictory impulse in-scene—his resolve arrives with minimal friction or struggle. The backstory about chasing safety remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific memory or error. His final commitment feels earned by atmosphere more than causally pressured character work.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Herald’s interiority is vivid and particular, especially in their shifting laughter and awe, but their motivation lacks contradictory impulses—desire to shape a new dawn never meaningfully conflicts with fear or doubt. Their choices feel consistent but not pressured by internal tension. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, though the Herald’s micro-choices (grasping the wick, steering the beam) reveal values clearly. Final endurance is credible but leans toward archetypal resolve over flawed humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his stained hands, magnetic intuition, and reverence for the morpho wing reveal character through action. The widow’s guarded resilience feels authentic, though her emotional shift leans slightly tidy. Both characters show contradictory impulses (holding on vs. letting go), yet Kael’s “gift” borders on diagnostic label-speak (“magnetic pulls”) without sufficient dramatized cost. Their exchange deepens stakes credibly, but the resolution lacks the grit of irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover what trees witness—is compelling but borders on abstract; his emotional embodiment is consistent yet lacks visceral contradiction under pressure. His micro-choices (handling the sextant, deconstructing it) reveal dedication, but internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized. The final realization feels earned by action, though the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“quantified sorrow”) without fully grounding it in bodily experience.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in her identity as a “scattered memory keeper.” Her internal conflict—between fragmented recall and urgent purpose—is embodied through trembling hands, sensory details, and micro-choices like pressing the mica to glass. However, her transformation from passive rememberer to active weaver lacks a decisive internal rupture; the shift feels lyrical rather than earned through struggle. The final steadiness of her hands reads as symbolic resolution rather than psychologically grounded change.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is sensitively rendered but leans on abstract summaries (“felt like an outsider,” “contradictions became her guiding light”) rather than embodied contradiction in-scene. Her final choice lacks a decisive micro-action that forecloses a path with visible cost—she simply leaves, carrying the same invitation. Thaddeus functions more as expositional oracle than crucible; their interaction reveals little about Elara’s hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—finding the sacred in the ordinary—is consistent and embodied through her gardening and reverence for the vanished bread. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile choices (e.g., brushing crumbs before planting). However, her emotional arc lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; the “tenuous absolution” feels granted rather than earned through struggle. The final renunciation or endurance isn’t dramatized with sufficient friction to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with her “gently meticulous” nature embodied in tactile details (gloved hands, breath misting). Her shift from preservation to active connection feels earned through the slide’s transformation, though the internal contradiction between order and urgency isn’t dramatized in simultaneous impulses—more sequential. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she abandons passive archiving for urgent meaning-making. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and rooted in her history, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—she’s resolute throughout, with little visible struggle. Her micro-choices (e.g., rejecting the flask, confronting the men) reveal values, yet emotional embodiment remains lean. The final renunciation (“reluctant guardian”) feels earned, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus longing—is embodied through her luminous glow and tactile interactions with the ring, but her emotional shift at the climax lacks micro-choices that demonstrate struggle. The “futuristic nostalgia” epiphany arrives as a declared state rather than an earned recalibration. Her motivation is consistent, yet the pivotal decision to follow the ring feels more inevitable than contested. Still, her sensory-based perception (taste shifts) grounds her interiority in a character-specific logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through embodied detail—charcoal-stained fingers, trembling hands—and her contradiction between mechanical repetition and buried passion drives credible micro-choices. The epiphany feels earned by the rediscovery of her past self-portrait, though the transition from paralysis to action leans slightly on symbolic convenience rather than granular struggle. Her mnemonic gift is noted but underutilized as a causal force; it functions more as texture than constraint. Final renunciation of her old identity carries felt cost via the broken lock and rebirth imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking lost conversations to restore truth and the oasis—is rooted in her unique gift and isolation, compellingly intensified by environmental decay. Her interiority is concrete (“hands trembled,” “weight of silence”), and her final choice to inscribe truth despite betrayal feels earned. The wilting script trait creates credible internal conflict without over-explaining. However, her emotional shift from despair to hope at the end leans slightly tidy given the moral complexity introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, and her seasonally mute trait adds texture, but interiority leans toward lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Her choices lack tangible trade-offs—no path is foreclosed with visible cost. The iceberg fragment guides action, yet emotional stakes remain generalized rather than viscerally conflicted. A credible endurance (Earned Stasis) is implied but not dramatized with on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior conflict between logic and emotion is embodied through tactile actions—hovering hands, glowing protocols—and her motivation intensifies credibly with the magnetic shift. However, her “fragmented wholeness” remains more a stated condition than a dynamically contradictory force in-scene; impulses alternate rather than collide simultaneously. The cost of memory loss feels earned, but the emotional progression leans slightly tidy, lacking irrational self-deception or hypocrisy under stress. Still, micro-choices (opening the box, activating miniaturization) reveal clear value hierarchies with tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motivation—listening as healing—is consistent and tied to her profession, but her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“felt personal,” “power of listening”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Mrs. Ellis functions more as exposition than crucible; their exchange lacks status tension or reciprocal pressure. The final act (unlocking the mailbox) feels earned by plot mechanics, not deep character struggle. Flaws are implied but not actively complicating her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is compelling and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are conveyed through lyrical description (“calm defiance,” “quiet, unwavering determination”) without contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The dance climax feels more like revelation than struggle, undercutting the cost of her transformation. Her character serves theme more than dramatized human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motivation is vividly rooted in personal loss and embodied through tactile details—the pressed wildflowers, the lantern lighter’s hands—but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The emotional arc feels earnest yet slightly tidy; his transformation leans on revelation over struggle. Micro-choices (reciting coffee patterns, stepping forward) align with motive, but the absence of resistance or misstep softens the cost. Still, his voice and specificity elevate him beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in duty and cosmic balance, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she never wavers or questions her role. Emotions are embodied through ritualistic action (clutching the wing, breath syncing with hum), yet remain abstract (“profound sense of peace”) without visceral friction. The final renunciation is credible but not costly on the page; no path is visibly foreclosed beyond implied vigilance. Her competence borders on effortless, undercutting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tactile relationship with the seal and her shame over neighborly disconnection. Her final decision feels earned through micro-choices (tightening grip on seal, knocking with sugar). However, Elias remains enigmatic without sufficient pressure or contradiction to qualify as a full crucible—his role leans functional rather than dynamically oppositional. The story meets Track A scope cleanly but lacks secondary character agency that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus curiosity—is embodied in tactile hesitation and micro-choices (kneeling, lifting the shell). Her emotional arc from isolation to independence feels earned, though the final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The “truly radiant” figure mirroring her risks abstraction, but the cost of carrying quarantined memories grounds her change. Motivation intensifies credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hand, calloused fingers, and visceral hesitation convey layered emotion without therapy-speak. Her motivation (forgiveness as self-liberation) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses bitterness with palpable cost. The contradiction between her identity as a forger of lies and her yearning for truth resonates throughout. However, the epiphany “Wisely enduring, I must forgive” leans slightly toward diagnostic articulation rather than purely dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a canyon echo singer, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—her resolve is steady, not tested. Emotions are embodied through sensory details (e.g., “reed-blown melancholy”), yet the epiphany feels slightly unearned due to minimal struggle. The seashell functions as an extension of her perception but doesn’t force difficult trade-offs. Her final resolve reads credible but leans toward lyrical acceptance over costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is compelling and consistent, driving her actions with emotional weight. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied reactions (tremor in her chest, steady hand) and micro-choices like whispering names. However, her “ghost whisperer” role leans on unexamined mechanics rather than personal contradiction, and her flawlessness under pressure edges toward safety-hedging. The final renunciation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional resonance, limiting full character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in tactile detail (e.g., her fingers on the bamboo whisk), and her motivation—to honor hidden effort—is credibly tied to her dual identity as net-mender and philosopher. However, her “contradictory impulses” remain underdeveloped; she experiences contemplation without meaningful internal resistance or competing desires that would deepen stakes. The final smile and deliberate whistle feel earned but lack a visible cost or renunciation that would elevate this to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—truth over comfort—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during peak pressure. Her “sharply observant” trait drives action yet feels more like a label than a lived limitation with tradeoffs. The final renunciation (reinforcing the seal) is earned, though the emotional cost registers more as atmospheric than visceral. A stronger micro-choice revealing competing values under duress would elevate this to 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in prophetic visions and sacrifice, but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—his choice feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Emotions are embodied (“hands trembling,” “weary eyes”) yet verge on lyrical abstraction (“gritty whimsy,” “bittersweet expression”) without grounding contradiction. The final renunciation of the old order is credible but not deeply contested within the moment, reducing felt moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in personal history and consistent with his actions, especially in his interaction with the music box and jars. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels and instead reveals contradiction through embodied choices—e.g., kneeling before a silent object yet persisting in faith. The memory of his grandmother functions as a micro-choice that deepens his present stance rather than merely decorating it. However, his transformation at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle against doubt or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” nature is asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in action; her internal conflict resolves too cleanly when confronting the figure. The final choice lacks a visible trade-off—she protects the key without sacrificing anything tangible, weakening Earned Stasis. Her profession and traits feel decorative rather than causally active under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to transform impatience into patience, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her epiphanies feel unearned because they arise from observation without tangible struggle. The story tells us she “unyokes chaos” but never shows the friction of that process in real-time choices under pressure. Her transformation reads as conceptual rather than dramatized, weakening the credibility of her final stance. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are absent, but single-POV execution falters in emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to break from her mentor is clear and intensifies credibly, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her resolve feels linear rather than fraught. Her “fortified vulnerability” is named more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The journal discovery shifts her stance, yet the emotional cost of confronting her mentor remains abstract until the photo reveal. Final renunciation reads as earned but leans on external proof over internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and morally fraught, with embodied doubt (“relief washing over him… only the beginning”) and a credible arc from skepticism to resolve. His micro-choices—carrying the heart, lingering on music boxes—reveal hierarchy of values. Alistair functions effectively as secondary pressure without overshadowing. Final renunciation of passivity is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation—yearning to create something resonant—is consistent and embodied through tactile work, sleepless obsession, and the talismanic arrow tip. Her internal contradiction (defiance vs. awe) surfaces in micro-choices: clutching the arrow while reaching for the bell. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off; she simply resumes tinkering, diluting cost. The “steadily curious” trait is stated but not dramatized as a constraint with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “brightly attentive” trait, which enables key discoveries. Her interiority is concrete—e.g., sensing a “void in the data”—and she makes meaningful micro-choices (lying to her supervisor, using an old terminal). However, her emotional arc lacks contradiction; she moves linearly from curiosity to resolve without internal friction or misbelief that complicates her path. The final decision feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a “shadow-laced peacekeeper” who seeks to “map empathy onto action.” Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead showing embodied emotion through tactile interactions with the crystal fragment and mirrors. However, her internal conflict remains abstract—fears and doubts are summarized rather than dramatized under pressure—and her transformation lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off with visible cost. The final act feels earned thematically but not causally grounded in prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is compellingly idiosyncratic, and her interiority avoids diagnostic clichés—especially in her embodied fixation on the parasol and “sound of endings.” However, her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; she listens and reflects but never actively wrestles with a decision that forecloses a path. The man’s question triggers insight, not action, leaving her arc more observational than agentic. This limits the cost’s visibility despite strong thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and emotionally specific, with embodied contradictions—e.g., “too practical for dreamers, too passionate for pragmatists”—that ground her epiphany. However, the final realization leans slightly into diagnostic self-awareness (“understanding didn’t require perfect alignment”) without sufficient micro-choice buildup to fully earn the shift. Her gently persuasive trait is noted but never dramatized under pressure. The burned letter catalyzes reflection, yet her transformation hinges more on metaphor than action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “strangely honest” nature is stated but rarely tested; her interiority leans on abstract labels (“ache,” “fulfillment”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices (kneeling, speaking) align with motive but lack visible trade-offs or struggle. The final renunciation reads as serene duty, not costly endurance—cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and personal, rooted in loss, and her calm demeanor informs her methodical approach. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she moves steadily without hesitation or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. Her choices are consistent but not pressured; the story shows devotion, not struggle. The absence of a micro-choice with visible cost undercuts full character agency at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s reticence feels earned and consistent, rooted in reverence for language rather than mere shyness. His micro-choices—humming into the crystal, trembling as he writes—reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over ease, patience over speed. The interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied (“breath shallow,” “hand trembling”). However, his transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he endures, but never truly wrestles with abandoning his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through tactile actions and spatial disorientation, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—to capture the sound of growing older—drives micro-choices (chalk lines, driftwood placement) that feel authentic to his fractured temporality. The internal contradiction between clinging to echoes and seeking a future sound is sustained without resolution, culminating in Earned Stasis. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to “harness the ephemeral” is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her dismantling of the clock. Her interiority is concrete (“luminous ache,” “hands moved with precision”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her epiphany via the leaf feels slightly unearned—no prior contradiction or struggle undermines her competence, flattening emotional risk. The resolution shows credible endurance but lacks a visible cost beyond abstract transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices—like contacting Claire—that reveal her values under pressure. However, Mrs. Bennett remains underdeveloped beyond her function as a catalyst; her emotional shift feels assumed rather than dramatized. The “decisively kind” trait borders on label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene. Elara’s competence lacks genuine struggle, leaning toward idealized professionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her scholarly obsession and personal loss, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped—her “quiet deliberation” reads as competence without meaningful struggle or flaw. The relearning of runes feels more like recovery than transformation, and the emotional cost of closure (mentor’s absence, isolation) is implied but not viscerally embodied in action or choice. Her final readiness lacks a visible trade-off; the story avoids showing what she sacrifices to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her "forgiving skeptic" nature and desire to mend mistakes—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; emotions are embodied yet occasionally veer toward abstract summary (“heart both lighter and fuller”). The stone sacrifice feels earned, though the guilt over her friend’s substitute body is under-dramatized, reducing the cost’s visceral impact. Her shrewd innocence guides navigation but doesn’t visibly constrain choices with trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is rooted in a specific trauma and consistently drives her actions, particularly her rejection of fire and devotion to gentle light. Her interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with sea glass and memory, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—her resolve is unwavering, reducing tension. The final choice feels earned but leans toward serene certainty rather than conflicted endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her amber pendant, moss-tending rituals, and guarded dialogue reveal a watchful dreamer grappling with exposure. Her micro-choices (brushing the pendant, leading Kai through the garden) align with her motivation to graft meaning onto wounds. However, her emotional shift toward openness lacks sufficient friction; the transition from guardedness to shared vulnerability feels slightly accelerated without deeper internal resistance dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict between self-protection and giving voice to others is credibly rendered through embodied reactions (skin prickling, breath catching) and micro-choices (closing her eyes to receive the story). However, her “lucidly watchful” trait remains largely declarative rather than demonstrated through constrained perception or costly missteps. The final decision lacks a tangible trade-off—she gains clarity without measurable loss, weakening the cost legibility required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her desire to heal her village through forgotten lunar practices. Her interiority is vividly rendered through tactile engagement with the vine tendril and workshop objects, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily from hope to fulfillment without internal friction or missteps that would deepen credibility. The absence of struggle or blind spots undercuts the “genuine flaw” criterion for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poetic desire to translate heartbeats into maps, but her interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are described through lyrical filters (“quiet triumph,” “unwavering patience”) without contradictory impulses or tangible struggle. Her patience is stated repeatedly but never tested by meaningful opposition or internal conflict. The character reads more as an archetype than an individual with specific limits or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his peripherally focused nature and desire to preserve wonder. His interiority is concrete—humming a tune that mirrors gear rhythms, noticing reflection angles—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice feels earned, yet emotional complexity remains muted; wonder is pursued without meaningful internal resistance or cost beyond fatigue. A stronger tension between reason and emotion would elevate this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—between self-sacrifice and the dawning need for self-understanding—is embodied through tactile gestures (gripping the lamp, tracing air) and culminates in a credible micro-choice: shifting her weaving inward. Her motivation is consistent yet deepened by pressure from the figure, whose challenge forces a reevaluation rather than a tidy reversal. The final line—"weave not just the threads of others, but her own"—earns its emotional weight through prior calcification imagery. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains sensory and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests in tactile rituals (tea, carving) and contradictory impulses (desire to contain vs. acceptance of impermanence). Her motivation stems from consistent traits: devotion, resilience, quiet observation. The final act of carving earns her endurance without tidy resolution. However, the husband exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied regret and chronologically fractured perception, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation—to negotiate with her “ghost”—is consistent and intensifies via interaction with the camera wheel. The final choice to move forward feels earned by prior causality, though the internal contradiction between resignation and hope could be sharper in-scene. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli’s motivation is consistent and interiority is concrete, especially in his tactile engagement with the sextant and terminal. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—his “functionally creative” drive operates without meaningful friction or self-doubt, flattening internal conflict. The final renunciation (accepting the terminal’s obsolescence while carrying hope forward) is credible but leans on assertion rather than dramatized struggle. A single flaw: no visible cost beyond time spent; stamina, tools, or social stakes remain untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the scent of petrichor tugging like an “old wound”—and her contradiction (duty vs. dream) manifests in simultaneous impulses, not alternating summaries. Her final act—completing the clock—is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost: she reconciles with, rather than abandons, her sanctuary. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotions arise through tactile perception. The only limitation is that her father exists off-page, slightly softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to uncover buried truths, and her actions align with that drive. However, her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“architecture of lies,” “forgotten truths”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final stance feels earned but lacks a visible tradeoff that forecloses a path—she gains clarity without measurable loss. Her emotional state remains static, more contemplative than conflicted, weakening the cost legibility required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a preserver of lost knowledge. Her interiority is concrete—hands brushing snow, breath visible—and her patience manifests in deliberate action, not just assertion. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from tactile engagement with rope and glass. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle (she deciphers the knot flawlessly) slightly limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The traveler’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially in her silent observation and ritualistic writing. Her motivation—to “write obituaries for the living”—is consistent and deepened by the talismanic thread. The elderly woman’s grief feels authentic, though slightly veers toward archetype; her emotional shift is earned through the traveler’s witness, not imposed. Both characters’ choices reveal values with visible cost: the traveler gives presence, the woman releases a self defined by waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in his desire to restore beauty, and his internal conflict—between mechanical means and natural ends—is embodied in his trembling hands and moral hesitation. His weariness and determination feel specific, not archetypal. However, his epiphany about “beauty cannot be forced” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing rather than fully dramatized insight. The final choice shows credible endurance with felt cost, but the internal contradiction could pulse more urgently during the assembly beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, stained fingers, and quiet resolve convey contradiction without therapy-speak. Her motivation (“to prove that scars can sing”) is consistent and compelling, driving a high-stakes symbolic act. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choices under pressure; the final peace arrives with minimal friction. The arsonist’s legacy is well-integrated, but the redemption feels more lyrical than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her skepticism wars with wonder without diagnostic labels. Her “realistically imaginative” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., pocketing the shard despite doubt) that escalate stakes credibly. The final act—placing the mirror shard—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost: confronting her younger self’s trapped memories. However, the transformation from skeptic to “liberator” leans slightly toward epiphany over gradual recalibration, softening the flaw-confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her struggle reads as a series of realizations rather than competing desires under pressure. Emotions are poetic but not embodied in specific physicality; “hands brushed against soft glow” gestures toward sensation without visceral tension. The final renunciation (“share light without fire”) feels conceptually earned but not viscerally costly—no tangible loss or trade-off is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tactile engagement with the ribbon and stone. Her motivation—to carve collective grief—is consistent and intensifies credibly through memory and sensory cues. However, the epiphany about grief as “migration” arrives with minimal friction or contradictory impulse; it feels more like a quiet realization than a hard-won insight under pressure. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in specific backstory and internalized shame, and his transformation feels earned through incremental action. However, the shift from mechanical duty to communal healer occurs largely off-stage via summary (“he spoke to the townsfolk more”), weakening the causal chain of micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—“winding hearts”—is resonant but leans toward diagnostic label-speak (“incremental grace of a life well-lived”) rather than embodied contradiction. His ethical diligence constrains early behavior but isn’t tested by a meaningful trade-off that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to give voice to the voiceless—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his role as a cemetery gardener who treats graves as texts. His interiority is vividly rendered through tactile engagement with the tapestry and sovereign case, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves from curiosity to revelation without resistance or doubt, flattening internal conflict. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but an embrace—cost is conceptual, not embodied, weakening the “felt cost” requirement for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ignorance’s motivation is clear and consistent—reviving a stagnant kingdom—but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses. Emotions are embodied (“hands trembled… from the weight of possibility”) yet verge on abstraction (“promise of something yet unwritten”). His choice to write feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with minimal resistance or trade-off dramatized. The mentor’s quote substitutes for active struggle, reducing the cost of his final act.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role and the story famine, driving consistent, high-stakes choices. Her interiority avoids abstraction, grounding emotion in tactile details like the quill hovering or fingers brushing the dial. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped—her determination lacks contradictory impulses that would deepen psychological realism. The final resolve feels earned but leans slightly toward idealized purpose over human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and emotionally grounded, with interiority conveyed through embodied gestures (e.g., clutching the pouch, brushing fingers against it). Her contradiction—seeking permanence through impermanence—is woven into action rather than stated. However, her backstory lacks micro-choices that alter present tactics; reflection dominates without reciprocal pressure on decision-making. The final renunciation feels earned but leans slightly on conceptual resonance over causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s internal contradiction—clinging to rational order while drowning in decay—is well established, and his micro-choices (e.g., gripping the cog, following Lira) reveal hierarchy of values. However, his transformation leans on summary (“abrasive calm giving way to a flicker of hope”) rather than embodied crisis, and Lira functions more as thematic foil than fully pressured interlocutor. The final decision lacks a visible cost beyond implied risk, weakening Earned Stasis. Interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“rationally rebellious mind”) without sufficient tactile grounding under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her dedication to harmony and preservation of vanishing arts. Her interiority is conveyed through concrete sensory details (e.g., the rosette as talisman) rather than abstract therapy-speak. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves from resignation to quiet triumph without meaningful internal friction or missteps. The final renunciation of noise feels earned but untested by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her grandmother’s wisdom and her rebellion against societal indifference, with interiority grounded in sensory memory (“taste memories embedded in food”). Her doubts during the sprouting sequence reveal authentic contradiction, and pruning becomes both literal action and metaphorical stance. However, the epiphany upon eating the fruit leans slightly toward unearned universality—“countless others who had nurtured”—which dilutes the specificity of her personal arc. The final smile feels earned, but the transition from doubt to certainty lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs her something beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness is credibly embodied and shapes her isolation and resolve, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her motivation feels linear rather than layered. The final choice to reveal the truth aligns with her trait but arrives without visible tradeoff or hesitation that would deepen cost. Her emotional progression is consistent yet tidy, missing irrationality or hypocrisy that would signal authentic struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete perception and micro-choices—his handling of objects, his ritual speech—but his motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through conflict. The “inadvertently profound” trait is shown, yet his transformation lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; his epiphany feels earned but untested by opposing desire. His flaw (hyper-attunement to quiet loss) enables his insight but doesn’t visibly cost him anything beyond melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—absolute certainty versus desperate hope—is embodied in her frantic thoughts and tightened grip on the ampoule, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Liora’s “incisively kind” nature manifests through restraint and precision rather than action, aligning with its immovable form. However, Elara’s shift from rigidity to openness occurs largely off-page (“she decided to test the serum further”), reducing the visceral cost of her transformation. The story implies but doesn’t dramatize the struggle that earns her change.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grip on the dice, breath steadiness, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The chipped die’s loss triggers a credible emotional rupture that reconfigures her stance without tidy resolution. However, the transition from “grim optimist” to acceptance leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“realized the texture… was not something to capture but to let go”) rather than purely dramatized action, softening the epiphany’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “methodically hopeful” trait is concretely embodied in her nightly ritual and deepens under pressure as the brush compels action. Her internal conflict—between insomnia-born isolation and yearning for connection through art—is consistent and layered, not summarized. However, the shift from personal solace to cosmic purpose lacks a micro-choice that visibly trades one path for another; the transformation feels received rather than wrestled. The final stance (“saffron quiet”) resonates but isn’t forged through a renunciation with legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, and her micro-choices—using the honey, shaping initials, placing bread on the altar—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped; her “rosewater dread” is evocative but not embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The epiphany about the lens as catalyst arrives cleanly but borders on unearned without deeper struggle or misstep. Her historically oriented trait informs action but doesn’t generate tangible trade-offs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—his rebellion against linear time drives every action—but his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; we’re told he feels “bleak exhilaration,” yet never shown competing impulses in real-time decision-making. His “neatly inventive mind” is asserted more than demonstrated through struggle, and the absence of a second character limits relational pressure. The cost of his act is felt but not embodied beyond trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s internal conflict—fear of being forgotten—is compellingly embodied through her interaction with the clasp and mirrors, but her emotional progression leans on diagnostic phrasing like “unbosom your fears” and “fear feeds on your doubt,” which edges into therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (e.g., tracing the clasp, opening the dictionary) reveal values, yet the advisor’s guidance dominates her agency. The final confrontation feels earned, though the epiphany arrives with slightly too much articulation for a mid-crisis realization.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leeward’s motivation is vividly rooted in “sketched resonance,” and his micro-choices (striking specific notes, interpreting cloud fractals) reveal a coherent value hierarchy. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his epiphany feels unearned because no resistance or doubt clouds his actions. The story leans on poetic certainty rather than struggle, flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her quiet drive stems from grief, curiosity, and pattern-based faith. Her interiority is embodied through tactile actions (tracing symbols, clutching the whistle) rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice to descend and later accept the living shell feels earned, with visible cost in the weight of Valtara’s impending collapse. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; she never wavers, missing a layer of human tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s emotionally rational trait is consistent and shapes her perception, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she processes feelings like texts, which risks diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, yet her epiphany about “lies as acts of love” arrives without sufficient prior friction to feel fully earned. Micro-choices (e.g., interpreting the ledger) reveal her values, though her competence borders on effortless, reducing struggle. The final renunciation—contextualizing rather than destroying lies—is plausible but leans tidy for such a complex moral terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—resurrecting submerged dreams—is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving his meticulous repairs and journal preservation. His “stoically sensitive” trait manifests in embodied restraint (raw hands, soaked clothes) rather than exposition. The shift from surveyor to “archeologist of abandoned dreams” feels earned through tactile labor and the inkwell ritual. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; he moves cleanly from urgency to resolve without competing impulses clashing mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to trace honest origins—is clear and intensifies credibly, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves with near-uniform resolve. Her “logical” trait is asserted more than dramatized through flawed choices or missteps. The antique stamp functions as externalized motive rather than emerging from embodied struggle. Final renunciation isn’t shown—she departs with purpose intact, missing a felt cost that would elevate this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his calloused hands, origami cranes, and aversion to the basilica’s light reveal grief without therapy-speak. His contradictory impulses (to craft vs. collapse) act simultaneously in scene, especially when he abandons the lantern for the basilica. The final choice to honor rather than escape grief feels earned through micro-choices: setting aside the lantern, unfolding the crane. Lira’s presence applies immediate, relevant pressure that catalyzes his shift without resolving it for him.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zara’s motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her transformation feels linear rather than dialectical. Emotions are embodied (“dress in tatters,” “jolt of clarity”), yet the epiphany via crystal borders on unearned without prior micro-choices testing her agency. The final stance is credible but leans on symbolic resonance over dramatized struggle. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics don’t apply.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s “perpetually surprised” trait is noted but never shapes decisions or creates trade-offs—label-only interiority. His motivation (“frequency of belonging”) remains abstract, with no contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. Actions align with plot needs but lack flawed struggle; competence outweighs vulnerability. Final resolve feels unearned because prior choices show no meaningful cost or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile details (the watch hand biting his palm, trembling legs) and internal contradiction—he both doubts and crafts lies with professional ease. His micro-choices (taking the watch, descending to the shore, aligning the hand with driftwood) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—choosing not to add more lies—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains visceral, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., “cold air biting her lungs”) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values—empathy over force, reflection over reaction. Her “uncommonly thoughtful nature” manifests in action, not label. Kael’s resistance feels grounded in past betrayal, though his shift leans slightly abrupt; the cost of his concession (“I do not forgive lightly”) is felt but could be more viscerally anchored. Contradictory impulses—apology vs. pride, forgiveness vs. justice—are present but resolved with near-tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling legs, scarred kayak, and tactile handling of the compass ground her emotional state. Her motivation (“to align heart and actions”) is clear and sustained, though the shift from despair to hope leans slightly toward unearned epiphany without a decisive micro-choice that forecloses an old path. The “broken navigator” identity feels authentic, but the resolution lacks a concrete renunciation or cost beyond abstract “backlash of regrets.” Still, her kinship with utility poles reveals a credible hierarchy of values shaped by failure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—seeking empathy while haunted by betrayal—but his epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“empathy wasn’t something to kindle; it was something to carry”) that borders on label-speak. His micro-choices (dropping the ball, wading in) reveal values under pressure, yet the past remains abstract, limiting emotional specificity. The clean-slate premise creates tension, but the “procedure” functions more as exposition than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in grief and longing, but her internal contradiction—clinging to the past while seeking renewal—is under-dramatized. The epiphany that the bond is with herself arrives cleanly but leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“reconnection to her own power and truth”) rather than fully embodied revelation. Her micro-choice to conjure is credible and costly, yet the transformation feels more declared than wrestled from struggle. Still, her arc aligns tightly with the story’s thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a specific familial ritual and personal absence, compelling her journey with emotional precision. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying regret through tactile interaction with the saucer and cards. The micro-choice to shed her cloak symbolizes renunciation without over-explanation. However, her internal contradiction—between duty and presence—could be more actively simultaneous rather than sequentially revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifism is consistent and thematically resonant, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her resolve never wavers under pressure, flattening emotional stakes. Motivation is clear but untested by genuine struggle or blind spots. The final renunciation feels declarative rather than earned through layered micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the texture of transformation”—is consistent and rooted in her past, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from doubt to epiphany without meaningful resistance. Her destitution and philanthropy are stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The bottled lightning bugs reveal sentimentality, not complex interiority. Final renunciation (releasing the bugs) feels earned but leans on symbolic convenience over psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “calmly inventive” nature drives her to decode the sundial and activate the cradle—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. Thorne’s presence creates interpersonal pressure, yet his shift feels under-earned; Elara’s moral stance dominates without genuine struggle or blind spots. The final choice is credible but leans on declared conviction rather than layered, irrational emotional tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his precognitive curse and obsession with sacred patterns. His interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied—e.g., “his hands moved swiftly, guided by an intuition he could not explain.” The final epiphany feels earned through concrete action (scattering the dust, placing rocks), not abstract revelation. However, his internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“furiously tranquil gaze,” trembling hands paired with deliberate slowness—and their motivation (cartography of scars) emerges organically from past trauma. The final choice to write uncensored feels earned by the slow build of pressure and the symbolic map’s revelation. However, the emotional shift at climax leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“fear, hope, regret, all dissolving into a singular clarity”) that borders on label-speak, undercutting full embodiment in the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his mechanical arm’s precision versus his philosophical yearning—and Mara’s sharpness tests rather than mirrors him. The “diplomatically fierce” trait manifests in tactical wordplay, not just label. However, Mara’s shift from defiance to contemplation lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs her; her arc feels reactive, not earned. Final revelation hinges on Elias alone, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias and Clara are vividly rendered with consistent interiority and embodied emotion, particularly in their shared reverence for words as resistance. However, Elias’s “monthly molting” remains a poetic label rather than a lived constraint—no on-page choice hinges on it with tangible cost. Clara’s backstory enriches her but lacks friction; both characters verge on idealized archetypes without complicating blind spots. Their bond feels earnest but under-pressured, missing the crucible that would force a costly recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her grief, longing, and strategic creativity feel embodied rather than abstract. Her micro-choices (e.g., following the compasses, loading the reel) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. However, the shift from passive mourning to active seeking lacks a clear contradictory impulse in-scene; the “steely longing” appears more as declared trait than simultaneous struggle. The final renunciation of an encore for a “new song” is earned but slightly smoothed by lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in protecting cultural memory, and her choice to accept the burden of collective truth feels earned. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she voices certainty without palpable struggle. The creature’s test resolves too cleanly, missing an opportunity for moral ambiguity or hesitation that would deepen character. Her “luminous doubt” remains a label rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s slow speech and bonsai expertise are consistently embodied, shaping his perception and choices. His internal conflict—regret over unsaid words—is rendered through tactile interaction with objects rather than diagnostic labels. The final act of reading and releasing the letters feels earned by his methodical, patient character. However, his transformation leans slightly toward quiet epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.
