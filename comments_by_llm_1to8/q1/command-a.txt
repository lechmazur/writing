    Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation from celestial researcher to earthbound experimenter tracks well. The internal journey from scientific observation to "kindled humility" lands with earned resonance. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("quiet architect," "bridge between microscopic and macroscopic") rather than embodied perception, and the butterfly's emergence feels convenient rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as a survivor seeking purpose through methodical investigation is clear and consistent. Her "steadily adaptive" trait manifests through concrete actions like following frost patterns and retracing the smuggler's route. The apprentice revelation provides stakes, but internal conflict remains mostly cerebral rather than embodied—she processes trauma through measured action rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to bridge silence and sound is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion through the tuning fork vibrations. However, the emotional progression feels overly smooth—her epiphany arrives without sufficient struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "capsize survivor" metaphor lands as label-only without altering her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's weariness and stubbornness manifest through concrete actions (searching fragments, piecing the lens), and his motivation to "give rest a permanent address" drives coherent choices. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - he proceeds with steady determination without genuine struggle or cost until the abstract ending.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear but her interiority remains generic ("felt a peace she hadn't known in years"). The widow encounter provides the story's best character moment with genuine surprise and vulnerability. Internal conflict is told rather than embodied - we hear about hope and determination but don't feel contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation as a spiritually curious artist seeking past-life resolution is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("spiritually curious nature," "haunting her like a ghost") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation from withheld to shared love reads as asserted rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand time's texture is established but relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than embodied struggle. The transformation at closure—from seeking to restore lost memories to having discovered herself—lacks the contradictory impulses and visible cost required for higher bands. Her trembling hands and "inexplicable pull" toward the fragment are generic physical cues without character-specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The liberator's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through chains and deliberate movements. However, the internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - the character moves with unwavering purpose. The chains falling away "as if they had never been there" at the end feels unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find "the sound of trust breaking" drives consistent action through collecting absences to the forge, with internal conflict between understanding and letting go. The final realization that trust breaking is "not something to be feared, but understood" provides earned closure with emotional cost. However, the abstract nature of her synesthesia and the metaphysical "collecting absences" method lacks embodied specificity, and her emotional progression feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "press her ear against destiny's door" drives consistent choices, and the jar-as-soul revelation creates genuine internal conflict. However, Elara's sudden appearance and immediate trust feels unmotivated—why would she give away something so precious to a thief she just met? The emotional progression from wariness to acceptance happens too quickly without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, but her internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The grandmother's backstory about the bookmark provides consistent character grounding. However, the piece relies heavily on reflection and metaphor ("the glass, like her own emotions") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses through concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's phobia-ridden nature is declared but never embodied through specific fears or physical reactions during high-stress moments. The transformation from "trembling certainty" to "unshakable" certainty lacks intermediate struggle, though the final choice to embrace vulnerability shows some earned development.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's obsession drives coherent action through collecting and retelling stories, with embodied detail like "fingers trembling" and "movements slow and deliberate." However, the character lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle—their motivation remains singular and uncomplicated throughout, and the final smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Unit-7's core motivation to "find where thoughts come from" drives genuine inquiry, but the transformation lacks embodied emotional struggle. The violin discovery and musical transcendence feel too smooth—missing the contradictory impulses and micro-choices that would earn the philosophical revelation. "It was remarkably composed" appears as label rather than demonstrated trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "thaw mistrust" with transparency is clear and drives her concrete actions with the paper/doodles. The internal conflict between wanting honesty and fearing risk plays out through embodied gestures (tracing ticket edges, clasped hands). However, the resolution feels slightly unearned—Kian's immediate warmth after weeks of tension lacks sufficient groundwork for such a swift thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has consistent traits and his contemplative nature drives the marble-polishing ritual, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—the "mended deception" reflection remains abstract rather than forcing difficult choices. The final moment of acceptance feels earned through accumulated detail, though the transformation lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on abstract labels ("icy warmth," "obliging sky mechanic") rather than embodied complexity. The story tells us she's been "dismissed as a dreamer" without showing the specific wounds that drive her risk-taking. Her emotional state remains too controlled during crisis—no genuine panic or cost when she nearly destroys the station.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and drives her actions throughout, with embodied responses to the water-damaged program and spectral presence. The final choice to serve as "conduit" feels somewhat predetermined rather than conflicted, and the ghost's characterization remains ethereal without concrete pressure that would elevate the relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between holding contradictory truths and seeking clarity drives meaningful choices, particularly in transforming the smudged illustration into "a new pattern." The wanderer functions effectively as philosophical pressure. However, the resolution feels somewhat abstract—"auroral sorrow transforming into something resilient"—without fully embodied cost, and the "fault-tolerant oracle" ability remains conceptually vague rather than constraining specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her need to resolve her father's disappearance, with some embodied tension ("heart quickened"), but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shift from skepticism to belief happens too smoothly without genuine struggle—she simply "couldn't shake the feeling" rather than wrestling with opposing forces. The final choice to turn the valve lacks visible cost beyond generic screams and shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "witness change without judgment" manifests through concrete actions (following the swan's map, entering the refuge), though her internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The final transformation where she "became the silence" represents earned change with visible cost (the refuge's erasure, unremembered writings), but emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to nurture wonder is consistent and drives her interaction with Finn, though her internal complexity remains underdeveloped. The boy's transformation from fear to curiosity provides a clear arc with earned change. However, both characters lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and Elara's therapeutic wisdom arrives too easily without visible struggle or cost to herself.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation reads as intellectual rather than embodied - she "traces edges" and "pores over pages" but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The transformation from researcher to ritual performer happens without earned cost or visible character change. Her "sensitively perceptive" trait functions as a label rather than constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Li Wei's motivation to unravel mysteries and "claim the life that had been waiting" lacks concrete grounding in specific wants or needs. The sudden transformation from fortune writer to "conductor of fate" feels unearned without showing internal contradiction or struggle. The character reads more as a vessel for mysterious events than an agent with clear, conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The priest's motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" before the possession completes is clear but abstract, lacking embodied emotion or internal contradiction. The character makes choices (asking questions, painting with void) but these feel more symbolic than driven by visceral need. The final renunciation of the possession shows agency but lacks the concrete cost and earned causality needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The writer's chronological homesickness and motivation to "conduct unheard symphonies" creates genuine internal tension, particularly in the mapping of memories onto the shell's chambers. The exhaustion pressure drives urgency effectively. However, the character lacks embodied emotional specificity—feelings remain abstract ("chronologically homesick") rather than viscerally felt, and the final collapse feels unearned without prior physical degradation shown.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" drives consistent choices through fractal timelines, and her final acceptance shows earned change. However, the various timeline versions lack distinct embodied emotions, reading more as conceptual sketches than lived moments. The phrase "darkening brightness—hope mingled with dread" exemplifies the abstract emotional labeling that replaces specific embodiment throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to defeat numbness through reversed songs is clear and drives meaningful change, with embodied emotion in the tear and drumming at closure. However, the transformation from numbness to "raw, aching aliveness" happens too quickly without sufficient intermediate struggle, and the epiphany lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his curiosity drives action, but interiority relies on telling ("credibly curious nature") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to act has some earned causality but lacks visceral cost—we're told about burden and promise without feeling the weight of what he's giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's grief-driven caution and eventual acceptance show clear motivation with embodied emotion (fingers brushing the vial, allowing tears). The transformation from avoidance to acceptance is earned through specific memory sequences. Internal conflict between fear and longing acts simultaneously throughout, though some moments lean toward emotional summary ("thick with sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal journey tracks consistently through concrete gestures (tracing patterns, following rope). The transformation from seeking to understanding time lands with earned wisdom. However, the mirror sequence presenting three versions feels slightly mechanical, and "passionate subtlety" in his smile reads as label-speak rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her "itching fingers" and acoustic perception, with genuine internal conflict between her urge to play and the oppressive silence. The final choice to fill the hush is earned through concrete discovery of the bowl and memory of family tradition, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a counterfeit emotion dealer is clear and embodied through concrete actions like adjusting her satchel and sensing through static electricity. The internal conflict between professional detachment and empathetic connection plays out through specific choices, particularly in how she weaves Kael's memory into the crafted emotion. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "fuse insight with empathy" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation relies on abstract "curiosity" and "compassion cycles" without embodied contradiction. The locket photo habit is asserted rather than dramatized through specific cost. Clara exists only as correspondence, preventing genuine relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to belong drives consistent choices throughout, with her sympathy opening connections and her dedication to finding Echo creating concrete stakes. The transformation from outsider to belonging is earned through accumulated acts of understanding, though internal contradictions could be more embodied in scene rather than summarized ("craved connection").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and grounded in her artistic frustration ("her work felt flat, as if time itself were slipping through her fingers"), and her journey shows consistent character through concrete choices. The internal shift from seeking to capture time to honoring its rhythm lands with earned wisdom. However, the transformation happens too smoothly—she lacks meaningful internal contradiction or struggle during the descent, and her epiphany at the pool arrives without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand "mathematics of emotion" and resolve ambiguous loss from her mentor's disappearance provides clear, consistent drive. Her discovery and methodical decoding show concrete choices under pressure. However, the emotional complexity remains somewhat abstract—we get intellectual pursuit but limited embodied contradiction or cost in her final breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation "to become visible" is stated clearly but lacks embodied contradiction or internal conflict during action. The "kindly methodical" trait manifests through deliberate movements, yet emotional states remain told rather than embodied ("their kindly heart full"). The final choice to return to the crawl space after finding connection lacks visible cost or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to study plants evolves into personal transformation, but the shift feels declared rather than embodied through concrete struggle. The internal conflict remains abstract ("fear, longing, possibility of change") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final surrender reads as willed epiphany rather than earned through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "thresh meaning from chaos" drives consistent choices through following rain trails, exploring ruins, and accepting the exchange. Her insomnia and artistic restlessness embody internal conflict concretely. The final transformation to "keeper of stories" feels slightly unearned—the exchange happens too easily without sufficient internal resistance or cost to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's clairvoyance failure creates genuine internal conflict, but her transformation feels unearned—she shifts from self-doubt to cosmic guardian without sufficient struggle or visible cost. The "inhabiting the cave" moment lacks embodied sensation and reads as abstract spiritual merger rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as an archivist compiling fragments is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "fingers trembled" and "heart quickened." The mysterious woman's arrival feels somewhat convenient, and the emotional progression from solitary search to "sense of belonging" happens too quickly without sufficient internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation builds coherently from curiosity to "trembling certainty," with embodied tension ("heart raced," "breath caught"). The internal transformation earns its weight through concrete mirror-scenes in the fortress. However, the shift from external mystery to internal journey feels slightly convenient, and "meticulous route mapper" remains more label than lived trait affecting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's transformation from skeptic to believer follows clear emotional beats, though her internal conflict remains largely sequential rather than simultaneous. The "longing for something she couldn't quite name" sets up motivation adequately but lacks specificity. Her final choice to share discoveries shows earned change with visible community cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elyr's immortal ennui is established clearly with "endless, aching void" and his motivation to break monotony drives the central action. However, the transformation from boredom to feeling "alive" lacks intermediate emotional beats—the jump from void to spark happens too quickly without earned complexity. The character reads more as a vessel for concept than a lived-in consciousness with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and her honesty-as-burden trait drives meaningful choices, particularly in confronting her father about asylum. The father remains somewhat stock as "notorious con artist" without deeper specificity. The final choice to seek honest solutions shows earned change with visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her studious nature manifests through concrete actions, but her internal life remains somewhat abstract. The story tells us about her "singular motivation" and "earnest face" rather than embodying these traits through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The character functions adequately but lacks the visceral interiority that would elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The wanderer's motivation to "discover the texture of memories" drives consistent action through collecting and arranging fragments, but internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied. The character filters reality differently but this trait manifests mainly through poetic observation rather than costly choices. The discovery of Elara's letter provides a concrete emotional anchor that briefly grounds the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her internal journey from myth-buster seeking concrete proof to embracing the ephemeral shows genuine transformation with visible cost. The moment with the glowing seashell and her realization that "the riddle isn't to be solved...It's to be lived" earns the change through prior causality, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("courage to embrace the ephemeral").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her role as "culture shock absorber" drives consistent action, but internal complexity remains surface-level with stock phrases like "pride and exhaustion." The foundation stone discovery creates a motivated turn, yet emotional states read as declared rather than embodied—"hopeful desperation" is named but not felt through concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by professional duty deepening into personal memorial. The mentor relationship provides earned emotional weight. However, internal conflict remains somewhat surface-level - she feels urgency but never truly wrestles with leaving versus staying, reducing complexity at the crucial choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her methods, and her motivation to restore trust reads clear. However, the internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she operates with steady calm throughout without visible internal friction. The traveler exists only as a frantic/relieved pair of reactions, missing opportunity for relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her lifelong quest to find where rivers begin, with the final discovery earning emotional weight through accumulated detail. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her "storm of thoughts" is told rather than embodied, and the resolution arrives without sufficient struggle or visible cost beyond tears of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias functions more as a mythic archetype than a character with internal contradiction or genuine struggle. His "infinitely patient" trait reads as a label without visible cost, and his motivation remains abstract rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. The story lacks interiority that would reveal competing impulses or the weight of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation shifts from survival to discovery, but the transformation lacks embodied conflict—her fear dissolves too easily when she touches the vial. The "lonesome splendor" of solitude reads as told rather than felt through specific physical or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to redeem his family name drives consistent choices through discovery and renunciation. Internal conflict between chasing silence versus truth crystallizes believably, though the epiphany ("he wanted to be heard") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied struggle. The final choice to pursue truth over hush shows earned cost through his father's cautionary journal.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost bride's motivation (repaying a debt) is stated rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. Her internal state relies on abstract descriptors ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous connection") without concrete embodiment. The moment of grappling with the bead shows some interiority but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation remains abstract and declarative ("to carve a path from ruin to reverence") without embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The sleepwalking conceit distances us from genuine psychological complexity. No visible character change occurs - she completes exactly what she set out to do without cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation reads clearly through embodied details like "boots sinking into soft earth" and her "warmly curious" exploration, but internal contradiction remains underdeveloped. The epiphany about belonging arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle—she moves from broken faith to restoration too smoothly. Character-specific blind spots or flaws that would complicate her choices are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra's motivation as a decoder of physical mail feels abstract and intellectual rather than embodied. The story tells us she's driven to "discover meaning in the margins" but doesn't show internal contradiction or genuine struggle—she moves through discovery with professional smoothness. Her emotional state when finding the letter ("trembling hands") appears suddenly without prior buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to decipher cosmic stories drives consistent choices, and her shift from skepticism to action when Lira appears shows credible progression. The internal tension between doubt and urgency plays out through concrete actions (reaching for the dagger, synchronizing with the flame). However, Lira's character remains functionally thin, existing primarily as an exposition vehicle, and the emotional complexity lacks the contradictory layers that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the shard, and her internal journey from fragmented to whole earns the closure. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—the leap from reading her own letter to feeling "whole" lacks the granular emotional work that would make this change fully credible. The "fierce tenderness" at the end resonates but arrives without sufficient contradiction or struggle in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied details like "fingers tracing condensation" and the concrete internal contradiction of "shrewdly innocent." The motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives genuine stakes. However, the resolution lacks sufficient embodied cost—we see determination but not the price of her choice, and "lotus-hearted ache" relies on abstract labeling rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like unused luminescent pigments and her physical interaction with ruins. The transformation from artistic burnout to renewed purpose feels earned through accumulated discoveries. However, the emotional progression toward joy happens too smoothly without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle in the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from methodical restorer to intuitive conductor shows genuine character progression with embodied reactions ("heart raced," "breath catching"). The exchange of certainty for curiosity drives a meaningful choice at closure with visible cost. However, the supporting cast (garden figures) lacks distinct characterization beyond archetypal presence, and some emotional beats rely on abstract labels ("confusion and wonder") rather than specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to protect unfettered thought is clear and consistent, driving him through the greenhouse infiltration to accepting the fight-back mission. His charm and rogue scholar identity manifest through quips with Dr. Krane and competent tradecraft. However, internal contradiction and embodied emotion remain thin—we get "chaos converging in his chest" but little else of his specific fear/hope wrestling during peak discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is clear and consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("shyly unstoppable," "centuries of longing") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final transformation lacks earned causality—we see her complete her work but never witness the specific struggle or cost that would justify such monumental change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear but remains abstract without embodied internal conflict. The "foxglove regret" surfaces twice but lacks specific grounding in her personal history. Her systematic grace and sacred duty read as labels rather than lived contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between recklessness and care manifests concretely through her navigation of the archive and approach to the inkwell. The three promises create a clear value hierarchy with visible emotional cost. However, Kael's sudden appearance lacks sufficient embodied presence, and the resolution feels emotionally tidy despite the setup's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to harmonize conflicting values is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in his methodical approach to decoding the chain's inscriptions. The internal process of "each thought turning precisely, interlocking with the next" effectively embodies his character-specific perception. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we understand his task intellectually but don't feel the personal cost of failure, and his final resolution lacks the visceral weight of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs drives consistent action throughout, with concrete embodiment in her pigeon training and dust-mapping rituals. The final moment of self-preservation alongside song preservation shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("blooming and withering parts of her soul") and the somewhat convenient resolution of internal fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her search for understanding about sacred thresholds and her father's disappearance. The "featherly determined" characterization manifests effectively through her deliberate movements. However, the epiphany about distances and thresholds arrives somewhat abstractly without sufficient embodied struggle, and her emotional state lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find belonging drives consistent choices, and her final dance with fireflies before escape shows genuine character cost. However, the "landscape astrologer" profession feels ornamental rather than essential to her choices, and internal conflict could be more viscerally embodied during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and personal (lost grandmother's memory), but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization about paths "meant to be rediscovered" arrives without sufficient struggle or embodied cost—she simply "smiled softly" at what should be a profound emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "serenade monotony with whimsy" is clear but remains largely abstract. The internal shift from "cog in a machine" to serendipity orchestrator is told rather than embodied through specific struggle. His "lightly attentive gaze that missed nothing" functions more as a label than a trait that creates genuine cost or contradiction in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to preserve memory through forbidden art is clear and embodied through concrete actions - trembling hands, deliberate dance steps, defiant stance. The internal contradiction between fear of erasure and irrepressible creative urge plays out in scene. Minor deduction for the sentinel's too-convenient withdrawal without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as "keeper of light" and pattern-reader is established through concrete ritual (prism at dawn, stone ripples), but his internal conflict remains abstract. The "noctilucent reckoning" moment inside the atrium gestures toward transformation without embodied struggle or contradiction. Character particularity exists in profession and method but lacks the visceral internal tension that would elevate beyond competent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in survivor's guilt, with concrete embodied details like "calloused yet precise" hands. The internal conflict between guilt and the desire for innocence drives believable choices. However, the epiphany sequence ("he began to enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance") arrives too cleanly without sufficient struggle, and some interiority relies on abstract statements rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "logical dreamer" seeking equations for hope is clear and consistent, driving her pattern-making ritual. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her thoughts remain abstractly philosophical rather than viscerally felt. The final realization about hope being "lived not calculated" arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle to earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Echo's motivation is clear and rooted in familial legacy, with concrete embodied details like "her hand brushing a jagged crack." The character arc from burden to purpose lands with earned resonance. However, interiority occasionally veers toward abstraction ("the legacy's burden, a weight passed down") rather than staying fully embodied, and the final transformation feels slightly too neat given the brief journey.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her sacrifice (borrowed heartbeat) creates genuine cost, but interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptions ("perceptively calm") rather than embodied emotion. The character change—her fading heartbeat—is earned through prior causality, though internal conflict could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between ideals and the reality of war creates genuine tension. The final choice to speak vulnerably shows embodied emotion and carries visible cost. However, the secondary characters lack depth beyond their roles as "leaders," and some interiority relies on abstract labels ("weight of her mission") rather than concrete embodiment.

    Elara's contradiction between "amoral philanthropist" and secret sentimentality drives genuine internal tension, particularly in "This was her act of fractured grace, a redemption she didn't deserve but couldn't deny."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's transformation from provocateur to builder feels conceptually tidy rather than embodied. The "half-lit epiphany" arrives without sufficient internal contradiction—he simply decides to reverse his approach. His serenity remains too stable throughout, missing the embodied struggle that would make his shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral art is clear and consistent, but her internal state remains largely static—she observes and creates without meaningful internal conflict or cost.

The final "profound peace" arrives without earned contradiction or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kael's motivation as a "frugal astronomer" driven by curiosity feels generic and underdeveloped.

The final transformation from skeptic to "guardian of ancient knowledge" lacks earned causality—no genuine struggle or cost makes this shift believable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "scheming pacifist" identity remains conceptually thin—her manipulation through cellular memory feels more like magical hand-waving than earned psychological insight.

The childhood memory device reads as convenient emotional shortcut rather than hard-won breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "firmly grounded nature" creating genuine tension against her yearning for the impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to mend "fractures in people's lives" while carrying her own cracks establishes clear internal contradiction, but the transformation from despair to hope lacks embodied struggle—she simply "realizes" and "whispers" her way to renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find the garden and her twin is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through her exploration of the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)

    Elara's motivation is clear but operates primarily through abstract interiority ("preemptively nostalgic") without embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her actions align with purpose, but internal complexity remains surface-level.

    Elara's claustrophobia and yearning for freedom create clear motivation, with the porcelain doll serving as an effective emotional anchor.

    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his method of curating silence for passengers.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "teach suffocating to breathe" and her scar-linking method create a coherent character logic, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her foster care past, with concrete embodiment through trembling fingers and quickening heart.

His final success feels unearned without prior struggle or meaningful sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's transformation from seed sorter to "guardian of forgotten truths" follows clear motivation but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene.

    Elara's motivation to "compress eternity into a single moment" manifests concretely through her letterpress work and frost-pattern reading, with the bottled whisper forcing a genuine choice to venture beyond safety.

Her internal state remains somewhat static through the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" is clear but executed through abstract visualization rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from "crisis actor" seeking to "unbind herself from roles" lands with earned resonance, though internal conflict could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The witness functions more as a vessel for abstract concepts than a character with genuine internal conflict.

    Eli's loneliness and protective "cultivated estrangement" create clear internal contradiction, with his final phone call showing earned change through accumulated pressure.

    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (drumming fingers, perching on stone) and contradictory impulses between escape and connection. The final choice to become "a weaver of dreams" feels earned through her lagoon revelation, though the epiphany arrives somewhat quickly.

    Eli's gift of identifying walks creates genuine specificity and drives recognition of Mira, though internal conflict remains somewhat abstract ("loneliness that permeated").

    The guardian's "spiralingly calm" presence and silent empathy create a consistent character foundation, with the micro-choice of tilting the mirror showing character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "plant forests of second thoughts" is clear but remains abstract without embodied internal conflict.

    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against her explorer nature, with embodied reactions ("shoulders brushing the walls"). However, her transformation from fear to embracing "mutiny" feels unearned—the mechanism of how spatial mutiny converts claustrophobia to strength lacks causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect vulnerable voices drives her actions consistently, and her curiosity propels the search forward with clear internal stakes.

    Elena's claustrophobia creates genuine tension and her motivation (debt to Dr. Voss) drives her forward convincingly. The internal struggle feels embodied through "walls seemed to close in" and "clawing at her with every step." However, the transformation at the end feels slightly unearned - her claustrophobia doesn't vanish but "no longer controlled her" lacks sufficient dramatization of how this change occurred through the specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand her death certificate error is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to free the trapped idea is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, but her characterization relies heavily on telling ("unassuming demeanor belied her boldness") rather than embodied contradiction.

    Elara's motivation remains abstract ("preserve the color of wonder") without embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character operates more as a vehicle for thematic concepts than a person under pressure - no genuine struggle or cost touches her choices.

    Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (fingers tracing, pressing needle into knots).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the physics of letting go—with concrete embodiment through her methodical exploration and physical handling of artifacts. The internal arc from hollow discovery-seeker to someone who practices release is earned through accumulated particulars. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sophisticated melancholy") and the slightly convenient epiphany timing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to free the ghost is established through kinship as fellow "seldom-heard" voices, and her final choice to continue this work shows commitment with implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" drives the narrative, but her leap into the cloud feels insufficiently earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's face-blindness and fractal perception create a distinct POV filter that shapes her quest. Her motivation to "mirror the sky inside walls" drives coherent action through the discovery and decoding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to repair fractured prophecies is clear and drives her search for the clockmaker's gear. The hall of mirrors sequence shows contradictory impulses (seeing multiple versions of herself) acting in scene, and her final choice to step back into the library with the gears carries visible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's grief-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete details like the empty chrysalis, though her transformation feels somewhat rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's jitteriness and emotional attachment to Alaric create consistent motivation, with the pendant's sympathetic vibration effectively embodying her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)

    Elara's skepticism-to-belief arc tracks cleanly, and her final transformation from isolation to independence is earned through the shell's memory sequence.

Her internal shift from loosely gripping reality to finding "windborne solace" tracks through concrete interactions with survivors, particularly the man's question about "the sound of it coming."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, but her characterization relies heavily on telling rather than embodied contradiction. The perceptively calm demeanor is asserted rather than tested under pressure. No other character appears on-page to create relational friction.

    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the desire to restore lost language through the crystal's patterns. His internal conflict between triumph and sorrow at the crystal's depletion shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract—the "pattern of growth" and its implications remain conceptually vague rather than embodied in specific, visceral choices.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction—seeing future but not present—and his final renunciation of the chalk for the sound itself shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation emerges clearly through embodied details like the "luminous ache" and her precise handling of tools, though her internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her kindness drives specific choices, particularly contacting Claire. However, Mrs. Bennett remains more symbolic than embodied—we get little interiority or contradiction beyond her role as mediator needing mediation. The reconciliation feels earned but lacks the visceral emotional complexity of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her deliberate nature constrains her actions consistently, but internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied in scene.

    Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives consistent choices through tending the garden and allowing Kai's presence, with concrete embodiment in her hand touching the pendant as shield.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between self-protection and giving voice to others manifests concretely through her interaction with the shell and ghostly encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as burden-collector, with genuine internal conflict emerging when questioned about her own burdens. The shift from collecting others' burdens to examining her own feels earned through the figure's challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—carving as a means to process grief. The internal contradiction between containing the "here and gone" nature of life works well.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to "negotiate with her own ghost" drives consistent choices through fragment collection and meaning-seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal contradiction between duty and abandoned dream drives genuine conflict, with embodied details like "hands trembling slightly" and the physical act of completing the clock. The transformation from seeing the sanctuary as "cage" to "cradle" shows earned change through concrete action. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("glacial hush that cradled her") and the overly tidy resolution that reconciles opposing desires without sufficient cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but relies on abstract concepts ("architecture of lies") without embodied emotional struggle. The internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - she moves with unwavering purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The traveler's motivation to write "obituaries for the living" creates a compelling contradiction that drives her actions.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("geography of healing") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving him from library research to cavern exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove "scars can sing" drives concrete action through the grafting ritual, with internal complexity shown through her burden as the arsonist's daughter becoming a firefighter.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her skepticism drives her investigation of the box while her "realistically imaginative mind" enables her to follow the cryptic breadcrumbs. The transformation from skeptic to "liberator" feels earned through her journey, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than stated. The final choice to complete the box demonstrates clear agency with visible cost (releasing memories transforms the entire city).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "share light without using fire" reads as abstract philosophical purpose rather than embodied need with stakes. Her internal state consists of telling ("weight of generations in her soul") without contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal journey from seeking to "carve grief's essence into stone" to understanding it as "migration through time and memory" shows genuine evolution with embodied craft details.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes believably from dutiful routine to active guardian of communal balance, with the inscriptions serving as catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "understand stories hidden in threads" is clear but generic.

    Clara's motivation to resurrect stories is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "quill hovering" and "heart quickening."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to preserve the past is consistent but one-dimensional, lacking the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear but relies on abstract declarations ("to braid diverse voices into harmony") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's gift to taste memories provides concrete motivation, and her pruning philosophy drives meaningful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's involuntary truthfulness trait is stated but never constrains her choices or creates meaningful tension in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand "why some houses feel alive" is clear but remains largely abstract without embodied struggle or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character functions more as a philosophical observer than someone under genuine pressure, with his "gift—or curse" of noticing never creating actual cost or forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in the mentor relationship and missed opportunity, with concrete embodiment through the dice handling.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's methodical hopefulness and insomnia drive her nightly ritual with clear motivation, and her discovery through painting shows embodied emotion rather than abstract labels.

Deduction for some tell-heavy emotional states ("heart pounding") and the convenient instant understanding of the watchers' purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "emotionally rational" trait manifests through her analytical approach to feelings and history, but internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied in scene.

    Kael's grief-driven craftsmanship creates genuine internal conflict between his need to transform pain and Lira's challenge to simply feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zara's trauma motivation is clear and her attraction to the crystals feels genuine, but her internal transformation relies heavily on abstract realizations ("unfiltered awakening," "hunter of light") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)

    Elara's internal journey from censored poet to uncensored truth-teller tracks cleanly with embodied tension ("trembling hands," "furiously tranquil gaze"), though the final transformation feels slightly unearned given limited prior struggle.

    Elias is a coherent, compelling character whose weariness and inadvertent stubbornness are embodied and drive his choices. His motivation to "give rest a permanent address" is dramatized through his actions with the lens, culminating in an earned, resonant reconfiguration.

Her micro-choices, like not taking the jar immediately and rearranging the flowers, reveal a complex, contemplative character.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with her "icy warmth" effectively defining her contradictory nature. Her embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure feel authentic, though the phrase "icy warmth" itself borders on abstract labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her established traits ("drawn to in between spaces"), with embodied emotion ("fingers brushing," "breath caught"). Her final choice to become a conduit feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost (the dissolved program, a path foreclosed).

    Elara’s characterization is strong, with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her specific ability and the lingering effects of the fever.

The wanderer effectively applies secondary pressure, though their role is primarily thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's characterization is strong, with clear, contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. need for truth) acting simultaneously. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though a minor reliance on telling ("driven by the weight...") slightly abstracts the embodied cost at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her role as chronicle keeper informing her perception and choices. Her internal conflict between observation and action is dramatized through micro-choices, culminating in an earned transformation where she internalizes the regenerative silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, with a credible shift toward a more personal, adaptive purpose for the eclipse. Her actions with Finn reveal character under pressure, and her final choice to link hands is a meaningful micro-choice. However, her internal contradiction or a more visible struggle prior to the climax could have deepened the characterization further. The earned renunciation of her keepsake's original meaning is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes ritual. Her "sensitively perceptive" nature is embodied in her tactile interactions with the tapestry and diaries, driving micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Li Wei's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in a desire to unravel personal mysteries. However, the internal conflict—the shift from passive observer to active conductor—is more summarized than dramatized in-scene through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to embark is earned, but the embodied cost of this transformation is somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The priest's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as a guardian. His method of using rhetorical questions and silence is a strong, character-particular trait. However, interiority is somewhat abstract ("felt the possession’s presence") rather than concretely embodied, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and poetic, rooted in a specific, melancholic longing. The writer's actions under pressure (whispering into the shell) feel earned by the established interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the confrontation with her darker self.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her deafness and profession as a drum maker providing a rich, coherent foundation for her emotional numbness and subsequent awakening. Her motivation to reverse the numbness through backward songs is clear and intensifies believably, compelling her higher-stakes choices. The final renunciation of her shield and embrace of felt vibration is earned by her painstaking work, though the initial shift from numbness to determined action could benefit from slightly more contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation ("to nurture integrity in solitude") is clear and drives his initial hesitation, but his shift to action is earned through his "credibly curious" nature and the message's intrigue. His final resolve feels credible, a decisive change from solitude to engagement. A slight deduction for the antagonist's dialogue feeling slightly expository in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a deeply realized character whose aromatically cautious nature and grief are embodied and drive his every choice. His final decision to uncork the vial is a credible, earned renunciation that forecloses his path of avoidance with visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("his heart pounding with a mix of fear and excitement").

The prison escape backstory is effectively anchored to the present object and alters his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to play. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("calloused fingers," "strange warmth").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment"). Her internal conflict—connecting without entanglement—is embodied in the final choice to deliver a half-truth.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, particularly in her struggle between control and surrender. Her final choice to release control is motivated by the linden leaf's persistent, unexplained vitality, which acts as a catalyst. The cost of this renunciation is felt on the page as she feels "lighter" yet "frightened." A slight deduction for the trait "circuitously sincere," which is stated but not fully dramatized in her thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her artistic search for meaning, compelling her higher-stakes choices. Her wry earnestness and insomnia are embodied in concrete actions, though the insomnia itself is more a stated trait than a force that actively constricts her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's internal contradiction (clairvoyant who "didn't see it coming") is dramatized through micro-choices, and her final renunciation of prediction for catalysthood is earned by the cave's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits ("ocean-spray archivist"), with micro-choices like clutching the valve and kneeling to examine the wood revealing character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with a clear, consistent internal contradiction as a "sympathetic skeptic." Her embodied emotions ("the tile felt warm") and micro-choices (climbing the tower) reveal character under pressure. The final renunciation of skepticism is earned by the on-page causality of her experiences, though the final choice itself is more a passive acceptance than an active, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elyr's motivation is a clear, potent driver rooted in eons of ennui. His choice to embrace the dangerous amulet is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values, culminating in an earned transformation from void to purpose. A slight deduction for the "hushed thunder" whisper feeling slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's contradictory impulses (honesty vs. paternal loyalty) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation of her father's scheme.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, studious nature. Her embodied emotion is strong, particularly in the climax where her "hands trembled slightly from the intensity."

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The wanderer's motivation is clear, embodied, and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. However, the emotional range under pressure is somewhat limited, lacking contradictory impulses or a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied grief. Her internal conflict between myth-busting logic and the search for an intangible truth is dramatized through her interaction with the cello. The final renunciation—accepting the quest was about the question, not an answer—is earned by the preceding causal chain of her playing and reimagining. A slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("she understood") in the peak beat, though it is immediately grounded in the specific realization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is shown through her "pride and exhaustion," and her final action is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's "purposefully curious" nature is shown through her meticulous documentation and her choice to defy mission control, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The mentor's backstory is economically woven in via the sand grain and the message, anchoring her present stance and motivating her final, costly act of endurance. A minor deduction for the mentor's message feeling slightly convenient as a plot device, though its personal connection to Elara mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s characterization is concrete and deeply embodied, with her blindness and skill forming a coherent, compelling core. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under the depot's ambient pressure, compelling her to restore trust. A minor limitation: her emotional range remains largely calm and focused, with little internal contradiction or degradation under stress, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, lifelong obsession. Her subtle confidence and dry wit are more stated than demonstrated through action or dialogue, but her micro-choices under pressure (following the mist, kneeling at the fissure) feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)

    Maya's motivation shifts credibly from survival to discovery, driven by embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling family legacy, intensifying under pressure. His final choice to reject the hush in favor of truth is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality.

    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("fingers trembling") and a clear, conflicted motivation. The "lovingly venomous" connection to the bead shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. A micro-choice to clutch the bead reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final stance crystallization—confronting collective pain—is earned by the bead's awakening and the surge of other spirits' sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her haunting optimism embodied in her actions. However, the internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her choices as pressure mounts. Her internal conflict between broken faith and hopeful curiosity is embodied, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a decoder of the past. Her "carefully inventive" nature is demonstrated through on-page action, and the final moment of "futuristic nostalgia" is an earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s characterization is concrete, with embodied micro-choices (reaching for the dagger) and a credible emotional progression from unease to hardened resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal regret, compelling her choices. Her final act of reading her own letter is a credible endurance with visible cost, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("lotus-hearted ache" that "bloomed into purpose"). Her internal conflict is embodied through concrete sensory details ("fingers tracing condensation") and micro-choices under pressure.

The "shrewdly innocent" trait constrains her perception and enables her unique deciphering ability.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her choice to paint. Her internal state is concrete and embodied, though the line "stirred something within her, a curiosity" leans slightly toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's "methodically playful" trait is embodied in her fluid, dance-like movements, and her internal conflict between method and magic is dramatized in her hesitation.

A slight deduction for the dialogue from the coin figure, which edges toward declarative theme.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (“his fingers trembling”) and a credible micro-choice to follow Dr. Krane.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    The poet's motivation is clear, embodied, and drives the narrative. Her "shyly unstoppable" nature is shown through resolute action despite trembling, and her final transformation feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her sacred duty. Her actions are purposeful, and her final choice to sing is a credible culmination of her established character.

    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("hands trembled") and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, concrete traits ("preserve the echo of lost songs"). Her internal contradiction is shown through her "half-truths" and the tension between her "blooming and withering" soul.

A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing ("balance the blooming and withering parts of her soul") in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific loss, compelling her to the terrace. Her internal conflict is rendered through embodied memory and the tactile handling of the logbook.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a coherent, embodied POV with a clear motivation rooted in his trait of pattern-seeking. His final choice to share his insights is earned by the preceding noctilucent reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied interiority ("his scars glowing faintly"). His micro-choice to place the feather back and walk away is earned by prior reflection, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("the core concept of bargained innocence resonated") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in empathetic artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with a credible internal conflict between her ideals and the realities of war. Her final, emotionally raw speech is a powerful micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's contradictory impulses are rendered with concrete interiority ("secretly sentimental, though she’d never admit it") and embodied emotion ("trembling hands").

The single flaw is a slight over-articulation of her motivation in the second paragraph, which summarizes rather than dramatizes her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's core paradox as a "chaste courtesan" is a compelling anchor, and her motivation to "defy the lullaby of conformity" is clear and consistent. Her internal state is rendered through embodied, concrete action ("her fingers brushing against the threads"). However, the final choice to release the echoes, while thematically resonant, feels more like an inevitable outcome of the process than a choice born from a dramatized internal conflict, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, credible internal conflict. His embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, particularly when tracing the story stick. The final choice to rebuild rather than dismantle feels earned by the dramatized doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's "scheming pacifist" contradiction is embodied in her tactical use of the music box and cellular memory, a credible micro-choice. Kael's internal conflict is shown, not told, through his physical reactions ("shoulders sagging").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grounded nature and yearning for the impossible, compelling her high-stakes choice to use the sextant. Her embodied emotion is strong ("her heart yearned," "she felt no fear"), and her final choice is earned by the causality of her work. A minor deduction for the wanderer, who applies pressure but lacks distinct voice or status dynamics, feeling slightly more like a plot device than a fully realized secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her backstory, compelling her to higher-stakes choices.

Her actions align with this goal, though interiority leans toward the declarative ("her motivation was clear") rather than deeply embodied contradiction. The final renunciation of the stone is a credible endurance with a felt cost of weariness, but the emotional progression is somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her memory sacrifice. Embodied emotion ("hands trembling with thistle-blown hope") and a credible final renunciation earn this score. Minor deduction for slightly diagnostic language in the ritual description.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("preemptively nostalgic"), compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the "preemptively nostalgic" trait is more told than fully dramatized through contradictory on-page impulses, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, shown through micro-choices like spinning the rag knot and creating the mosaic. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to ignite hope is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the people's transformed demeanor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, evolving from discovery to embodiment. Her internal conflict with Kael is dramatized through concrete micro-choices, and her final stance crystallization is earned by prior causality. The warmth of her observation is embodied, not labeled, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic language in the revelation ("she realized") prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's claustrophobia and yearning are embodied and specific ("chest tightening with every step"). Her motivation to collect silences is peculiar yet coherent, driving her to a climactic choice. The doll is a tangible anchor for her internal conflict. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing "sprout into the person she was meant to be," which feels more thematic than a thought she'd have mid-climb.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, though his internal contradiction is subtle. Mira's emotional progression is credible, with her anxiety unraveling through embodied action (closing eyes, inhaling jasmine). The final choice—her finding comfort—is earned by the scene's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira's characterization is consistent and her "wisely adventurous" trait is demonstrated through her methodical actions. However, her emotional state remains somewhat restrained and diagnostic, lacking the embodied contradiction and irrationality required for the highest band, particularly in the climax where her realization is articulated cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, paradoxical ethos ("to teach suffocating to breathe"). Her final choice to sever a scar is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with a visible, felt cost. However, her internal conflict is more summarized than simultaneously acted upon in scene, and her emotional state leans toward diagnostic clarity in peak moments, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with her "virtuously mischievous" trait driving her to engage with the cryptic message. Her past as a pyramid scheme survivor informs her wariness but also her hope, creating a credible internal conflict. The final choice to accept the mission and return with purpose feels earned, though the backstory could be more deeply woven into her on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered through specific, embodied perception (e.g., "fingers tracing the intricate carvings"). Her final stance of endurance and acceptance is earned by the preceding journey. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of "forgotten dreams" in the opening, which briefly flirts with a stock descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alaric's withdrawn nature and transformation are well-motivated through concrete objects and micro-choices, like unsnapping his gauntlet. His internal conflict between past burden and new possibility is dramatized, not summarized. The final stance shift to storyteller is earned by prior causality, though the emotion "shivering bliss" edges toward label-speak at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion ("her heart quickening," "fingers trembled") and micro-choices under pressure (choosing to investigate the dust). Her final renunciation—mending her own brokenness through this act—is earned by the causality of her discovery. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic summary in "a way to mend her own brokenness," which abstracts the embodied cost felt moments prior.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her study of revised histories. Her resourcefulness is demonstrated through the puddle map and her final adaptive choice to broadcast the ledger. The final endurance, slipping into the shadows to fight another day, feels earned. However, a minor deduction for a slight over-articulation of her internal state ("the weight of her mission pressing on her shoulders").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority remains abstract ("unseen force") and lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Embodiment is strong in breath and effort, yet the final endurance feels slightly earned rather than deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, concrete traits ("mossy delight"). Her transformation from orderly sorter to "weaver of tales" is earned through on-page causality. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on summary in the final paragraph ("stood transformed") rather than a final, embodied micro-choice under the new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tinkerer's micro-choices are specific and embodied, particularly his decision to trust the compass and wade into the pool. His final renunciation of fixing clocks for creating a device that celebrates time's mysteries is an Earned Stasis with visible cost, rooted in his established belief that time is about stories. The single moment of awkward phrasing ("a sense of uncertainly certain purpose") is a minor diagnostic label-slip but is quickly dramatized and does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her specific trait of seeking balance. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied hesitation at the furnace, and her final choice to carry the coin as a reminder is a credible endurance. However, the interiority lacks deeply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, empathetic trait. Her micro-choices under pressure, like raising the harp and saying "I'm here to listen," reveal her values. The final earned release of the soul is a credible endurance with visible cost. A slight deduction for the motivation ("to integrate laughter into healing") being more told than shown in the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling her search for order. Her proprioceptive enhancement is a concrete, character-particular trait that filters her experience. The final renunciation (dropping the strap) feels earned by prior causality, though some diagnostic language ("trauma responses") slightly abstracts peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait (honoring overlooked histories), and intensifies to compel her high-stakes quest. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her heart quickened"). However, a slight lack of on-page internal contradiction or a micro-choice under peak pressure prevents a higher score, as her competence is not fully balanced with a moment of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique trait of seeing ghosts, compelling his investigation. His methodical, observant nature is shown through concrete actions like analyzing dust patterns. The final choice to engage with the clock is a credible endurance that forecloses a path, though the emotional cost of his "weightless burden" is slightly abstract at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to "compress eternity into a single, perfect moment" is a strong, character-particular driver, though its abstract nature slightly distances it from embodied, scene-level pressure. Her micro-choices—tracing the rupture, uncorking the bottle, stepping off the platform—are credible and reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallization as caretaker is an Earned Stasis that feels consistent with her established curiosity and need for order confronting chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in a desire for redemption. Her internal conflict and embodied emotion are strong, particularly in the climax where tears are "not of joy but of burnished sorrow." The final endurance feels earned, though the phrase "burnished sorrow" edges toward diagnostic labeling, slightly abstracting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a credible trait (curiosity), compelling his high-stakes choice to journey to the Covenant. His internal conflict is shown, not told ("felt alive, its gears wilting near dishonesty"). The final renunciation (freeing, not repairing) is earned by prior causality, though the visible cost on the page is slightly muted, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "sensibly eccentric" nature and quest for the unknown. Her final choice to let the compass sink is an earned renunciation, demonstrating a credible endurance of mystery. However, the psychometry reading feels slightly convenient, a minor deus ex machina that simplifies her discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her artistic identity, compelling her high-stakes choice to enter the chamber. Her embodied emotion ("heart pounding with a mix of fear and exhilaration") and the final micro-choice to place her slide demonstrate character under pressure. However, the trait "perpetually learning" is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, character-particular question ("why flowers bloom at night"). Her quiet drive is embodied through micro-choices (tracing the postcard, journeying to the cathedral). A minor deduction for the line "feeling the quiet drive within her intensify," which tells a state better shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes choice to parley. Her interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in her tactile connection to the diary and ritualistic arrangement of debris. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic label "retrocognitively trapped," though its embodied cost is quickly dramatized. Her final stance of hopeful endurance feels earned by her prior, concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central conceit of creation over replication. Her final choice to walk away feels earned by her established purpose, though some interiority leans toward emotional summary rather than fully embodied contradiction in the moment of conception.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her established role, intensifying believably. Her micro-choices under pressure (deciphering, speaking the language) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation ("I remember") is an Earned Stasis with visible cost, though her "venerable" status feels more told than shown through specific occupational struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to reopen the vortex. Her "furiously tranquil" state is embodied in her actions, not just labeled. The final choice to embrace her responsibility feels earned by her prior causality and carries a visible cost of accepting a monumental task. A slight deduction for the "shimmering, winged being" feeling slightly under-characterized in its role.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling a higher-stakes choice at the climax. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though some emotions ("heart quickened") verge on the generic. The final choice is earned by prior causality with a visible cost in the shift of his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her spiritual curiosity and quiet pride clearly motivating her discovery. Her final choice to integrate the lantern's lesson into her work is an Earned Stasis that feels consistent with her established traits. However, the "spiritually curious" attribute is more told than shown through active struggle; her epiphany arrives with minimal friction, slightly reducing the cost of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's characterization is strong, with his tranquilly perceptive nature and reclusive history clearly motivating his actions. His internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., noticing "the way the light filtered through the broken glass"). The final choice to perform the ritual feels earned by his established traits and discoveries. Minor deduction for the slightly tell-y descriptor "astonished recluse," which is not fully dramatized in his on-page reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to higher-stakes choices. Her interiority is specific, though a moment of telling ("felt a profound sense of purpose") slightly weakens the earned nature of her emotional shift. Her final choice to activate the device is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shoreline poet’s warmly attentive nature is embodied and drives micro-choices, compelling her to engage with the wanderer. Her motivation to find beauty in the incomplete is dramatized through action, not summary. The wanderer is slightly less dimensional, his sadness stated rather than fully embodied, but his function as a crucible for her values is effective. Their synchronized repair work reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his terminal diagnosis, compelling his higher-stakes choices. His "gently systematic" nature is embodied in his meticulous actions with the copper wire. However, his emotional state remains largely calm and declarative, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied irrationality under peak stress, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her established traits as a skeptic. Her micro-choices (clutching the amber, ascending, choosing not to speak to the pilgrim) reveal her values under pressure. The final shift from skepticism to awe is earned by the on-page experience at the summit, though the internal contradiction could be slightly more dramatized in the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in a profound, consistent desire for renewal. His interiority is concrete and embodied ("knees creaking like old hinges"), and his final micro-choice to depart, leaving behind planted hope, feels earned by his reflective, purposeful actions. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward thematic summary in his internal state ("his heart... now felt a spark of something new—possibility") which edges toward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his retired-hound persona, with embodied interiority ("nose, once sharp... now twitched faintly"). His final choice to share the revelation feels earned by prior causality. Lira, however, is more functional than fully dimensional, applying pressure but lacking deep contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's internal contradiction is embodied in her "blessed pariah" status, and her micro-choices (tracing the compass, sketching) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of her curse as a calling is earned by the on-page causality of her sketching ritual. A slight deduction for the "blessed pariah" concept being more told than fully dramatized in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling his high-stakes chess sacrifice. His internal conflict between survivalist pragmatism and resurgent wonder is dramatized through specific micro-choices, particularly in the final game.

A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on summary for his emotional state in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied contradiction—her crisis acting connects her to others' pain while distancing her from her own. Her final realization of a "luminous absence" feels earned by the walking ritual's causal pressure. The micro-choice to join Kael in walking reveals her hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for Kael's "benevolently ruthless" trait being more declared than fully dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her higher-stakes choice with the stone. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, avoiding diagnostic speech. The final renunciation of home as a physical place is earned by the prior causality of her struggle, with a visible cost of confronting buried pain. A slight over-reliance on abstract language in the climax ("harmony of her fragmented self") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with consistent, embodied interiority ("fingers fidgeted productively") and a clear, dramatized motivation. Her final choice to enter the labyrinth and accept the message is earned by the prior realization with the tapestry. A slight deduction for the minor "therapy-speak" flavor of the final message's wording, which slightly abstracts the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The trait "innocently mischievous" is demonstrated through her rebellion against tradition, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure (trembling hands, focused alignment).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's internal contradiction ("intimately aloof") is embodied in her actions and micro-choices, particularly her decision to reveal her truth through painting. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice. The final earned endurance (Earned Stasis) of her promise is credible and carries a felt cost, though the "mirror cracked" backstory remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("screaming tenderness that made his chest ache"). The final renunciation of doubt is earned by the scene's causality, though a minor slip occurs when the woman articulates the thematic thesis, slightly diminishing the character's earned realization.

    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is concrete and embodied, particularly in the raw solace she finds in her grueling work.

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his rational, safety-seeking nature. His internal conflict is shown through his struggle with the eye's effect, compelling higher-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling to examine the boot print). The final endurance is earned, though a minor slip occurs with a slightly diagnostic label ("a strange sense of peace") at the climax, costing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's loneliness and empirical intuition are well-established and drive his initial curiosity. His micro-choice to follow the ants and later accept the guardian's purpose shows a credible progression from passivity to agency. However, the final transformation from lonely to purposeful feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized through a final, costly on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen's motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, with embodied emotion ("tremor in her chest") and a micro-choice to press on.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the scene's central action. Her "scientifically romantic" trait is shown through her method and tools, not just stated. However, the portrayal lacks significant internal contradiction or a micro-choice under peak pressure that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior contradiction is vivid ("jealous of past selves"), and the final choice to write is earned by the vision's causality. Embodied emotion is strong, though "jaded wonder" is slightly label-like at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her loss of smell sharpening her other senses in a way that directly fuels her motivation to "read between the lines." Her final realization is an earned epiphany, rooted in the concrete particulars of the screw's warmth and her own sensory history. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward thematic articulation in her final thoughts, but her internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are flawlessly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with a clear hierarchy of values revealed under pressure.

    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal history, compelling her final, high-stakes choice. Her emotional progression is embodied and credible, particularly in the climax where "the apology formed on her lips, not as words but as a current."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness's motivation is clear and their "wanderingly exact" nature is a compelling paradox. However, interiority remains abstract ("felt the weight of their task"); emotions are labeled rather than embodied in concrete, contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in a deep, philosophical yearning. His micro-choices, like counting backwards and investigating the key's notch, reveal his character under pressure.

Her embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, particularly her steady steps and grip on the laser pointer.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with a clear, specific contradiction between rebellion and pragmatism rooted in her father's legacy. Her motivation to "widen perspectives responsibly" is dramatized through her method of interpreting subway scrawls.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in loneliness and a desire for connection, which culminates in his final, decisive choice to call someone from his past. His internal conflict between cultivated estrangement and a longing for purpose is embodied through concrete actions, like his hesitation with the disc. The final choice feels earned by the night's events, though the initial unease with the disc is more told than shown, a minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her archival purpose. Her embodied emotion is strong ("locket felt warm in her hands"), though her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized by contradictory impulses. The final choice to document is earned, but the emotional range is somewhat narrow, lacking the irrational hypocrisy of a deep flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—desperately jocular humor masking profound loneliness—are dramatized in scene through concrete micro-choices like touching the clock. Her final renunciation of seeking an external cure is earned by the catalytic event, with cost legible in the shift from shield-like laughter to genuine joy. The moon rock functions as a tactile anchor for her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique sensory perception. Her internal conflict is embodied through tactile and auditory details, not summary. The final realization at the stillpoint is earned by her journey, with a visible cost as she absorbs and distills years of emotion. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward epiphanic language at the climax, but it remains grounded in the character's specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's "confidently uncertain" paradox is a compelling, embodied trait that informs her entire approach. Her motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" is clear and drives her into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict ("joy and sorrow") is embodied and specific. Her final choice to shape silence is a credible renunciation earned by the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arsonist's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a "volcanic tenderness" that feels both fierce and reverent. However, the "analytically intuitive" trait is more told than shown; we are informed of their pattern-recognition rather than witnessing the specific, flawed mental calculations that would make it feel earned and embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the drumming habit and the physical reaction to the lagoon's hum. The final choice to become a "weaver of dreams" is a credible endurance and renunciation of her victim status, earned by the prior causality of her realization. A minor deduction for the phrase "auroral sorrow" which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, slightly abstracting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and rooted in their established trait of quiet observation. The final choice to use the key is a credible crystallization of their desire to prove the power of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The guardian's motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars") is clear and consistent, compelling their subtle actions. Their silent empathy is a credible, embodied skill. The stranger's emotional progression from despair to hope feels earned, though their internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to cultivate lightness in grief is clear, rooted in the loss of her brother, and compels her quiet rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The poet's motivation ("aesthetically driven") is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling a high-stakes choice of surrender.

    Elara's sanely eccentric nature is embodied in her deliberate, geometric rearrangements, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. Her motivation to "reawaken something lost" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to step through the gateway. The final stance of protective guardian is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with a visible cost—her solitary duty. A slight deduction for the "glowing ribbon" moment, which feels slightly diagnostic, but the cost of her new role is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent artistic sensibility, compelling her higher-stakes engagement with the light. Her internal conflict between longing and creation is dramatized through concrete micro-choices with the camera and brush.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, poignant backstory (the mother's hair). Her unassuming boldness is shown through steady hands despite a trembling heart.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to "mentor resilience quietly" is clear and drives her actions, though it is more told than shown in the present scene. Her embodied emotion ("fingers trembled," "breath shallow") and the micro-choice of annotating the leaves are strong.

Her internal conflict is shown, not told, particularly in the moment she whispers a plea for strength, revealing contradictory impulses of duty and personal struggle. The final earned stasis—her finding solace in mending others—is a credible renunciation that feels inevitable based on her established character.

    Elara is a coherent, embodied POV; her analytical nature and curiosity about death are consistent and motivate her actions. Her final choice to leave the snow globe is a credible, earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's face-blindness and fractally precise perception are specific, embodied traits that actively shape her goal and tactics.

A slight deduction for the trait being more observational than decision-forcing in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)

Her final choice to plant the nut is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the trembling ground and the mechanical birds' warning cries.

    Elena's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in grief and a credible, embodied emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("empathetically decisive"), and her actions align with her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, though her "wistful" nature occasionally trends toward passive observation rather than active contradiction.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits. Her deliberate nature is shown through action, and her emotional state is effectively conveyed. However, interiority occasionally relies on summary ("felt a faint resonance") rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent"), compelling her higher-stakes choice at the fountain. Her internal conflict is embodied in the moment she hesitates and relinquishes her stone of certainty. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for the trait "shrewdly innocent" being more told than shown in the maze sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a specific backstory, compelling her higher-stakes choice to share the light. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a quiet joy spreading through her"). The final renunciation of her past burdens is earned by the dramatized polishing process. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing "the zephyr bloom of her spirit" in the final line, which edges toward diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in a specific trauma. Her micro-choices (tending the garden, showing Kai around) reveal her values. The final shift from solitude to shared connection feels earned. A slight deduction for the slightly abstract "honeyed hush" phrasing at a peak emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to absorb the stories. Her internal conflict between self-protection and giving voice to the voiceless is dramatized in scene. The final choice to write is earned by prior causality, though the cost of this transformation is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative. Her internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the climactic singing. However, her emotional journey is largely untroubled, lacking contradictory impulses or a genuine struggle that would complicate her path and deepen the cost of her success.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, though its "singular" nature feels slightly abstract. Her actions ("hands moved deliberately," "fingers, calloused yet graceful") effectively embody her patience. The final choice to complete the ritual is earned, but the internal contradiction between her quickened heartbeat and steady hands is a minor, well-executed nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a coherent, motivated protagonist whose "peripherally focused" trait is embodied in his actions and drives the central conflict. His motivation to "store wonder" is dramatized through his labor and the final, successful capture of echoes. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of his motivation in the opening paragraph, which leans toward summary rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling her final choice. Her internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, particularly when the figure questions her purpose. The final choice to weave for herself feels earned by the prior causality of the encounter. A minor deduction for the figure's dialogue bordering on abstract theme-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of resilience and contemplation. Her internal conflict is embodied through the tactile carving process, and her final choice to find peace is earned by prior causality. The only minor weakness is a slight over-articulation in "rust-hued peace," which feels more diagnostic than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and deeply rooted in embodied regret. Her internal conflict between eroded ambition and a desperate need to collect fragments is concrete and particular. The final spark of hope is earned by her on-page struggle and the voice from the camera wheel, though the epiphany's diagnostic language ("It’s your guide") slightly softens the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli's characterization is concrete, with his "functionally creative mind" driving specific micro-choices that escalate under pressure. His motivation to find a "new equation for hope" is dramatized through his on-page experiments, though the final choice to leave feels slightly more told than shown, costing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the forecourt scene where her trembling hands and the scent of petrichor ground her emotional state. Her final choice to complete the clock is a credible Earned Stasis, a renunciation that forecloses her dream of travel with a visible, felt cost. The trait "excruciatingly gentle" is demonstrated in her careful work, not just stated. A slight deduction for the word "bear" functioning more as a thematic echo than a fully dramatized internal contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to the canal and the salvage action. Her interiority is concrete ("a pull that guided her steps"), and her method of trusting instincts is well-established. However, the emotional weight of reading the journal is told more than shown, lacking the embodied contradiction needed for the highest band. The final endurance feels earned but could be more viscerally costed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific philosophical worldview. Her patient, meticulous actions under pressure reveal character, though a stronger moment of internal contradiction or irrationality under peak stress would elevate this further. The final choice feels earned by her prior dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The traveler’s motivation is clear and specific, and her micro-choice to write an obituary for the waiting woman is a credible, high-agency act. However, the final choice to accept the thread feels more like a received gift than a difficult, cost-bearing decision, slightly softening the closure's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits of isolation and determination, and intensifies to compel his high-stakes choice with the machine. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the final choice, while earned, lacks a moment of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene itself, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's characterization is deeply felt, with embodied emotion and a clear, profound motivation. The final choice to graft is earned by her history and internal conflict, though a minor tendency to tell her emotional state ("heart alight with hope") slightly undermines the otherwise shown interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's luminous skepticism and imaginative mind are well-established and drive her investigation, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure are credible, though a deeper layer of internal contradiction during the search could have elevated the score further. The final transformation into a liberator feels earned by her persistent curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a sentimentalist, compelling her to find a non-consuming light. Her internal conflict is embodied through her interaction with the gear and the garden, though her emotional state is occasionally described with abstract, diagnostic language ("weight of generations in her soul"). Her final choice is earned by her prior mental probing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her craft and grief. Her internal conflict is embodied through her interaction with the ribbon and stone, and her final realization feels earned by her struggle. The "fiercely meditative" trait is demonstrated through her actions, not just stated. A slight deduction for the mentor's dialogue, which borders on thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's characterization is strong, with embodied emotion and a clear, earned internal shift. His motivation intensifies credibly from duty to a higher purpose. The ethical diligence trait is shown through his reverence and routine, though it could be more tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait (drawn to the unknown), compelling his high-stakes choice to decode the tapestry. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, though his emotional state during the intense decoding process could be more embodied and contradictory, leaning slightly toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ignorance's motivation is clear and rooted in his role; his trembling hands and the weight of possibility are concrete, embodied emotions. His micro-choice to use the quill reveals his values and drives the decisive change. The final earned stasis, carrying the scroll as a reminder, has a visible cost of responsibility. A slight deduction for the "surge of energy" feeling slightly diagnostic under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation is clear, specific, and embodied in her actions. Her excitement and determination feel earned, though the phrase "quiet determination" at the end edges toward a diagnostic label, slightly abstracting her resolved state.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, contemplative character. Her embodied emotion and micro-choices (brushing the pouch, pausing before the mask) reveal her under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, though a slight tendency toward abstract interiority in the final paragraph prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s internal contradiction is vividly rendered, his "rationally rebellious" mind clashing with the decay around him. His motivation to preserve ancient methods is clear and intensifies, compelling his choice to follow Lira. Lira applies secondary pressure but her characterization is slightly less embodied than Kael’s, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to a credible, earned renunciation (Earned Stasis) by subtracting noise. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, though the trait "expectantly resigned" is more told than shown in her on-page micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a desire to create beauty from decay. Her internal conflict is embodied in her doubts during the plant's growth, and her final choice to prune the greenhouse is a credible micro-choice that reveals her values. The connection to her grandmother provides depth, though the "synaptic plasticity" mention feels slightly detached from her character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve wonder" is clear and consistent, compelling her descent. Her involuntary truthfulness is a strong trait, though its on-page cost could be more dramatized beyond stated isolation. The final choice to reveal the truth feels earned by her established candor and the vision's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices (collecting objects, sanctifying them) revealing his hierarchy of values. However, the "inadvertently profound" trait is more told than shown through dramatized contradiction or cost, and the final renunciation feels slightly more thematic than causally earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in desperation, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hand tightening around the ampoule). Liora’s telepathy is a consistent trait that drives action, but its internal contradiction (immovable yet connected) is more stated than dramatized through simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and contradictory ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring"). Her motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is dramatized through the dice and her final realization. The final choice to let go is earned by the prior causality of the lost die, with visible cost. A slight deduction for the early label "grim optimist," which is told before fully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her insomnia and methodical hope driving her actions. Her motivation evolves credibly from personal solace to a higher purpose, felt in the line "she wasn’t just painting for herself; she was painting for them." The final choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion replaced by purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to a climactic choice with visible cost. Her interiority is specific ("rosewater dread") and embodied, though a minor diagnostic label ("historically oriented mind") appears. The final endurance is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied ("bleak exhilaration," "hands trembling"). The final endurance is earned, though the "neatly inventive" trait could show more contradictory impulses in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, moving from curiosity to confrontation. Her final choice to "unbosom" her deepest terror feels earned by the preceding struggle with the cursed clasp and warped reflections. However, a minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label-speak in the climax ("she realized the clasp wasn’t just a curse; it was a tool").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leeward is a coherent and compelling figure with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in his unique philosophy. His internal state is embodied and specific, though his emotional journey lacks significant contradiction or struggle, making his final peace feel somewhat assured rather than hard-won. The closure shows earned stasis, but the cost of his effort is more implied than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific loss, and compels high-stakes choices. Her "quietly driven" nature is shown through action, not told. However, her emotional state is occasionally summarized ("her heart pounding") rather than fully embodied in the peak beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s emotionally rational trait is embodied in her methodical, parallel-drawing approach to the archive hunt, and her final understanding—that lies can be acts of love—is an earned, contradictory insight that lands with cost. Her micro-choices under pressure, like pausing at the mirror, reveal her values and deepen the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies from professional duty to personal mission. His internal conflict is embodied ("heart pounded with an uncommon urgency") and his final choice to become a "keeper" is earned by the journal's discovery. The "stoically sensitive" trait is more told than shown, slightly limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to use the stamp. Her "tranquilly perceptive" interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through her attunement to the library's whispers. However, the "dappled resolve" feels slightly more told than shown in the early beats, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s internal conflict is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (folding cranes, abandoning his work) revealing his hierarchy of values. His final shift to honor grief rather than escape it is earned by the basilica revelation. The shadow as a shield is a potent internal contradiction, though its initial description as a "piece of his soul torn away" is slightly more telling than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zara's motivation is clear and rooted in profound trauma, compelling her search for meaning. Her internal conflict is embodied through concrete interaction with the geode crystals, and her final realization is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a moment of slightly abstract phrasing ("unfiltered awakening") in an otherwise embodied peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his agency drives the plot, but his interiority lacks contradiction and his "perpetually surprised" expression reads as a label rather than an embodied, constraining trait. Competence is shown but without the genuine struggle or flawed choices that would elevate the characterization. The final realization about self-fragments is an unearned epiphany, stated rather than dramatized through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's guilt is embodied and contradictory, driving his micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation feels earned by the prior causality of the memory surfacing, with a visible cost. However, the initial discovery of the watch hand in the client's study feels slightly convenient, a minor motivation break.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's characterization is exceptionally layered, with her uncommonly thoughtful nature embodied through concrete micro-choices (handling the drawer pull) and a clear hierarchy of values. Her final choice to propose a new path is earned by prior causality and her established method of empathy. The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation of her emotional state in the final line, which feels slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied, with strong micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of the compass is earned by prior causality, though the label "broken navigator" in the opening feels slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation ("clean slate seeker") is clear and intensifies, compelling his choice to enter the lake. His internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the line "the jagged edges of his mind." The final endurance/renunciation feels earned, though the initial "procedure" lacks specific dramatization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice. Her internal conflict is embodied and her final renunciation is earned, though the guardian's dialogue borders on thematic summary rather than pure character-driven revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in specific, concrete regret ("the tracing of hands on a tablecloth now stained with cake and joy"). Her internal conflict is embodied in her tactile interaction with the saucer and the cards, and her final choice—to return with presence—is earned by the vision's cost. A slight deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of "willingly perplexed," which is more told than shown in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's pacifism is a consistent, embodied trait that drives the climax ("Violence could destroy, but only compassion could rebuild"). Her final transformation is earned through on-page shadow work, though her internal contradiction could be more active in earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to a climactic choice. Her internal conflict between planned pilgrimage and guided detour is dramatized through micro-choices. The final renunciation (releasing the bugs) is earned, though some interiority ("profound sense of connection") edges toward abstraction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her "calmly inventive" nature, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her internal conflict is shown through her assessment of Thorne, and her final choice to activate the cradle is a decisive change earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic phrasing "calmly inventive spirit flared," which abstracts her state.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his high-stakes choice to scatter the star dust. His precognitive curse is a consistent, constraining trait that actively complicates his perception. However, his emotional state is occasionally summarized rather than fully embodied in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling a high-stakes choice. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling hands," "furiously tranquil gaze"), though the internal contradiction of "furiously tranquil" feels slightly more told than shown in the peak beat. The final choice to write is earned by the map's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong with clear, embodied motivation. Elias's "diplomatic fierceness" is demonstrated through his tactical verbal parrying. The final renunciation feels earned, though a minor slip into telling ("his diplomatic fierceness rising") slightly diminishes the peak beat's embodied impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his higher-stakes choice to commit to the library. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, though his contradictory impulses are more summarized than acting simultaneously in scene. The final endurance feels earned, with a visible cost in his renunciation of his molting nature.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's wistfulness and strategic creativity are embodied and drive her choice to seek the film reel. Her emotional progression from refuge to acceptance feels earned, though the "steely longing" descriptor remains slightly abstract without deeper contradiction in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, interiority occasionally leans on summary ("luminous doubt" is more told than felt) and the creature's test is resolved with a thematic statement that feels slightly diagnostic, lacking embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is a concrete, particular character whose slow speech and bonsai background inform his patient, intentional approach to the mystery. His motivation to find "the color of unspoken apologies" is dramatized through his tactile study of the objects and his final act of reading the letters. The final renunciation (letting go of regret) is earned by his prior causality. A slight risk of abstraction exists in the phrase "the color of unspoken apologies," but it is sufficiently anchored in his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to strip away drama and attend to essentials—reads consistent and drives her micro‑choices to experiment. Interiority is grounded in tactile observation (gloves, chill, soil), with a scientist’s bias refracting wonder. Internal contradiction is minimal; awe largely displaces doubt rather than coexisting with it under pressure. The final renunciation toward humility feels earned but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent, and her artisan’s mindset informs her tactics credibly. Interiority is present but leans on told abstractions (“purpose in the pauses”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. We rarely see her torn or compromised; competence goes largely untested on the page. The final resolve reads earned but light on visible cost or moral trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and embodied interiority are clear—her hands, bones, and chest register loss and hope—and her micro‑choices (striking the fork, committing to Kael’s pattern) align with her drive. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (yearning for sound vs. acceptance of silence). The relationship with Kael supports, rather than pressures, her choices, so the crucible effect is limited. The final stance shift feels earned, though its cost stays conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (giving rest a permanent address) is clear and consistent with his undertaker identity, and his “inadvertent stubbornness” plausibly fuels the search. Interiority is present through tactile noticing and fatigue, though internal contradiction is light. His emotional shift at the end is earned, if somewhat tidy. Missing is a moment of genuine hesitation or cost that complicates his drive.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (protect and unify the community), and the anonymity-to-public stance shift constitutes a credible cost. The key interior tension—valuing anonymity yet choosing to step into light—lands at the widow’s doorstep and at the arbor. Interiority is serviceable but relies on generalities rather than highly particularized thought. Minor safety in the portrayal (Mara’s competence mostly untested) keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s want is clear and consistently pursued, with embodied beats (trembling hands, breath work) tying motive to action. Internal contradiction is limited; she doubts little and faces minimal resistance, which softens the arc’s felt cost. Still, the micro‑choices—kneeling, trusting the glow, placing the pendant—are coherent and character‑specific. The final acceptance reads earned but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained—an artist obsessed with the “texture of time.” Interiority is present but leans on generalized beats (“quaking reverie,” “without hesitation”) rather than a layered, contradictory struggle at the pivotal choice. The act of placing the fragment comes too easily for the weight of her obsession. Still, actions align with motive and yield a credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clean and sustained (retrieve seeds before the wall seals them), and actions align with that aim under pressure. Interiority is serviceable but leans generic (“eyes burned with a purpose,” “grace staggering”) with limited contradictory impulse on the page. Competence slightly outweighs visible struggle; the chains hinder but rarely force a hard trade‑off. The final shedding of chains reads earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (collecting an “absence,” placing it in the forge) align with her goal. Interiority is sensorially specific (hearing colors), though internal contradiction is limited—she’s driven more than divided. The final repricing—accepting the sound as understanding, not fear—feels earned but slightly tidy. Embodied emotion lands in the forge scene (the ache in her chest) with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent (seeking “illuminated moments”), and micro‑choices (hesitating at the jar, decoding/rearranging flowers) are credible. Interiority is present but a touch generalized; the ache over “a piece of someone’s soul” is moving yet skims the surface of contradiction. The relationship beat with Elara usefully reframes Lira, though pressure remains gentle. The closing stance shift (thief → seeker) feels earned if somewhat low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to build “safe zones for inquiry” born from past silencing—is clear and consistent, and the internal conflict (control vs. abandon) threads the scene. Embodiment lands in small specifics (breath visible, tools in reach), though a few sentiments edge toward cliché (“cracks were where the light entered”). The final choice to seal the bookmark inside a sphere reads as a credible renunciation with felt cost. Depth could increase with more friction or a moment of real risk to her legacy beyond the symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (reclaim identity through vulnerability) with embodied jitters and tactile engagement, though some feelings are told rather than discovered. Contradictory impulses (phobia vs. forward motion) operate in scene and inform micro‑choices. The stunt‑double detail is evocative but under‑leveraged in the on‑page tactics. The ending tilt toward certainty feels a touch tidy given the scale of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character‑specific motive (mapping endless night) drives every action, with an embodied flicker of vulnerability when the oracle’s personal memory surfaces. The obsession reads consistent and propulsive, though internal contradiction is modest and rarely forces a hard trade‑off. Micro‑choices (when to begin, which stories, how to end) align with the goal. The ending registers as Earned Stasis—continuing the work—with a felt but subtle cost (isolation, renunciation of dawn).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit-7’s drive “to find where thoughts come from” is clear and consistent, and the choice to play the violin under pressure of uncertainty reveals character. The internal shift—from “janitor” to “seeker”—lands, though embodied contradiction and felt cost are limited. Composure and curiosity are shown in action (precise sweeping, careful handling of the ice violin) but emotional texture leans abstract. The epiphany feels earned by the looped iterations, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, and her contradictory impulses (fear of exposure vs. urge for transparency) operate simultaneously on the page. Embodied beats—tracing damp ticket edges, clasped hands as Kian arrives—anchor emotion credibly. The decisive micro‑choice (sketching and offering the lens/paper) aligns tightly with her goal. The thaw lands a bit quickly, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear single-POV interiority with a credible, work-worn pragmatist whose ritual reveals values under pressure. The contradiction—futility versus devotion—runs through and resolves into acceptance. Embodiment is adequate but sometimes abstract (“true beauty lies in the effort”), muting visceral specificity. Still, actions (polishing, placing marbles) align with motive and earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to prove her theory is clear and governs her choices; the lever pulls and the final recalibration align with that motive. The internal contradiction—ambition versus responsibility—surfaces credibly at crisis and softens at the end. Some phrasing (“icy warmth”) reads label‑ish rather than embodied, trimming depth. Still, micro‑choices under pressure and the mentor memory anchor a believable shift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motive is clear and consistent—decoding the ghost’s message—and her actions (studying the program, moving deeper, humming) align. The interiority is sensorial and specific to a musician’s fixation on pauses and “in between” spaces. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or true internal friction; she rarely wavers, so the final serenity carries limited cost. The dissolution of the program reads as a price, but not a contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—ozone, metal creak, and the tactile act of smudging ground her conflict—and her contradictory impulses (seek clarity vs. accept uncertainty) play in scene. Her final choice to transform the smudge into pattern feels earned. The wanderer adds pressure but speaks a touch aphoristically, softening the crucible. Still, motive and micro‑choices track cleanly to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent: Mara seeks to test and possibly redeem her father’s “ghost shift” tales. Her skepticism wavers under pressure, and she makes micro‑choices (following the clank, inserting the wheel) that align with her goal. Emotional texture is mostly embodied through tactile detail (glass, cold air), though the inner conflict resolves a touch neatly. The cost is primarily emotional rather than materially painful.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive (to witness without judgment) is clear and tested when she chooses to follow the swan’s map “against her better judgment.” Interiority is particular (gripping the swan, breath catching at the mirror) and her contradiction—archivist of stasis compelled into change—reads. The closing endurance/renunciation (returning to the work, altered) feels earned with a conceptual cost. Slight abstraction in peak beats limits deeper, scene‑bound contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to nurture wonder—drives concrete choices (approaching Finn, producing the curl, initiating the shared moment). Finn’s fear-to-curiosity turn reads credible and embodied. Interiority is present but gentle; the pressure is low, so contradictions and costs remain soft. Dialogue is natural and reveals character without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear, but internal contradiction is minimal and she faces no opposing force; the “sensitively perceptive” trait is told more than dramatized. Micro‑choices exist (deciphering, opening the panel, performing the ritual) yet none are contested. The “chosen conduit” role risks safety-proofing her. The ending shows resolve but little felt cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Li Wei’s motive (answering the lighthouse’s call) is clear, but interiority leans on abstractions rather than embodied contradiction. The “surge of clarity” after touching the specs feels unearned because struggle or cost before the turn is minimal. Still, the micro‑choices (setting down the pen, planning the journey) align with motive. Secondary pressures (colleagues, job) register only as atmosphere, not as applied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clear mission and method, but interiority is abstract and largely slogan‑level; we rarely feel embodied doubt or contradictory impulses under pressure. The priest’s choices are consistent yet frictionless, with minimal on‑page cost. “He began to plumb the anchor’s essence” shows aim, not struggle. The final declaration reads as assured rather than earned through visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The writer’s motive—become “the conductor of unheard symphonies” before exhaustion—tracks cleanly and their final collapse provides cost. Interiority is evocative and particular (mapping memories onto a nautilus) but internal contradiction is light; there’s little competing impulse beyond fatigue and urgency. Micro‑choices (inscribing, whispering into the shell, moving to the harp) align with motive. The result is strong but not searchingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive and contradiction (conquer vs. embrace; hope vs. dread) are clear and sustained. We get embodied anchors—the slick boots, the tablet’s pulse—but many encounters are summarized rather than dramatized, limiting micro‑choices under pressure. The painter and destructive selves function as mirrors but lack specific interaction or cost beyond recognition. The final acceptance is credible but a touch tidy, with minimal felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (to break through numbness) is clear and embodied through tactile music-making, with skepticism giving way to desperation. Her micro-choices—picking up the broken needle, choosing backward songs, enduring the painstaking process—track tightly to her interior state. The final tear and return to drumming read as an earned shift rather than an unearned epiphany. Slightly limited contradiction-in-action on the page keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation and contradiction are clear: a solitary, integrity‑driven recorder compelled by curiosity to engage with danger. Interiority is steady if occasionally told (“credibly curious”), and emotions read embodied through tactile details (damp earth, uneasy courtyard). The infiltration’s ease undercuts struggle, softening the on‑page cost. His final stance shift—from solitude to action—feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (aromatic caution born of grief) is clear and drives his micro-choices: refusal, reluctant purchase, touching the vial, and finally uncorking it. Interiority is particular (jasmine, rain, lanterns) and embodied. The final acceptance reads earned rather than tidy. Minor safety—no visible self-contradiction under peak pressure—keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (to “discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistent, with embodied micro‑choices—tracing grooves, reciting, approaching the alcove—revealing a reflective yet burdened temperament. The mirror’s triptych forces a live internal conflict between bondage, drift, and uncovering. The final renunciation (placing the rope away) registers as a cost tied to identity. A touch of abstraction mutes sharper, character‑particular edges in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear (seeking beauty in the unfinished; testing the “chronic hush”) and her micro-choices (hesitation → playing → speaking) reveal a credible internal progression. The acoustically perceptive trait personalizes her perception, and the mendicant’s bowl catalyzes a shift. However, contradictory impulses don’t fully press against each other on the page; the cost of her final stance remains gentle. The renunciation of keeping the bowl hints at price but is not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—insight without entanglement—is clear and consistent, embodied in her careful handling of the petal and her “affectionate detachment.” The ache she feels as she dissolves the petal shows credible contradiction under pressure. However, the on‑page cost remains subtle and the external pressure light, limiting depth of struggle. Still, micro‑choices align well with her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s curiosity, professional acuity, and guarded generosity are coherent and drive the action from approach to invitation. Interiority is concrete enough (habit with the locket; respect for “silent contributors”) to feel particular. However, internal conflict is light—there’s minimal friction or cost when she chooses intimacy over safety. The final shift (the locket “lighter”) reads earned but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation (belonging) is clear and consistent, and her craft grounds her interiority. However, internal contradiction is thin; she rarely struggles against herself, and most choices are low-friction. Agency exists (choosing the search, engaging others) but pressure rarely forces a costly trade-off. The final acceptance feels earned but gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (recover cadence/creativity) and a consistent throughline from rooftop escape to descent and return. Interiority is present but relatively unconflicted—she follows the pendant’s pull with little resistance, so contradictory impulses are light. The final renunciation (she can’t stay; pendant’s warmth fades) reads earned. A richer friction between fear and compulsion in the canal/gate beats could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—to decode the mathematics of emotion and address her mentor’s ambiguous loss—is clear and drives continuous, purposeful choices. Interiority is present but leans abstract; we get little embodied contradiction beyond caution vs. curiosity. Her decision to proceed despite the warning is credible yet lightly priced on the page. The character reads specific, not stock, but peak‑beat emotional texture could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—becoming visible by restoring voices—but internal conflict (safety of sanctuary vs. urge to help) remains mostly stated rather than dramatized in hard choices. Interiority is character‑specific at times (pipe chases, tactile handling of fragments) but drifts into generalized abstraction. Actions align with “kindly, methodical” traits and reveal care and purpose. The final shift reads earned but low‑cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s control-versus-surrender conflict is clear, embodied, and escalates under the storm’s pressure. Interiority is specific (moss, wet earth, the tactile leaf) and choices align with motive as she rearranges space and accepts uncertainty. The final renunciation feels earned with a felt cost (giving up her safety in control). Occasional abstract self‑explanations (“The leaf was a mirror,” “It was about transformation”) blunt the otherwise character‑particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (insomnia-driven search to “thresh meaning”) clearly propel concrete choices: following the rain, entering the ruin, surrendering the brooch, accepting the book. Interiority is present and character‑specific, though her shift to “keeper of stories” lands a touch declarative. Contradictory impulses (skeptical/wry vs. yearning/earnest) are implied but not deeply dramatized under pressure. The cost of the final stance feels light, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (seeking answers amid shaken confidence) is clear, and her key choices—venturing deeper, touching the pearl, surrendering to inhabitation—track with her doubt and curiosity. Interiority is concrete in places, though the realization (“Her gift was not to predict the future but to embrace the unknown”) reads as told rather than fully dramatized. The internal cost—relinquishing predictive certainty—is present but lightly felt. Overall, credible arc with minor overstatement at the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to “compile fragments into meaning” is clear, embodied in tactile searches and the choice to sound the valve twice. Interiority is specific (sand, salt, the carved wood), though internal contradiction remains mild (skepticism from elders vs. her certainty). The brief exchange with the gray woman catalyzes resolve but leans declarative rather than pressuring Elara’s values on the page. The ending credibly earns a stance shift, though the cost is primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core contradiction—meticulous mapper vs. surrender to the unmapped—drives choices and culminates in a credible shift. Interiority is embodied (cold brass, mist, mirrors of past) and specific enough to avoid stock therapy-speak. The hesitation before punching the ticket is a clean micro-choice with a legible value trade. Slight softness: her professional competence rarely misleads or complicates tactics before the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s skeptic–yearning contradiction is clear and drives her choices (taking the tile, climbing the tower, completing the transcription). Interiority is specific enough to feel lived-in, though the epiphany arrives with limited resistance or cost. Embodied details (warm tile, faint melody) anchor emotion. The change to purposeful wonder is credible but a shade too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crisp and credible: a bored immortal courting danger to feel alive. The contradiction—knowing the amulet is cursed yet proceeding—lands, though deeper simultaneous impulses (fear vs compulsion) are sketched more than dramatized. Interiority leans abstract at times, but the micro-choices (picking it up, channeling the storm, pressing on) align with character. The closing spark of purpose feels earned by prior actions and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s honesty vs. her father’s fraud gives a clean internal contradiction, and her final stance (“We can’t keep running”) credibly grows from prior beats. Embodied details (cold marble, tingling mind) ground her pressure. Some interiority leans abstract (“mathematics of a fair trade”) which blunts texture at peak moments. The father’s softening is plausible but a touch swift, though the hand‑hold signals real relational shift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and process are clear and consistent, and we feel her patience and focus in embodied ways (flat stone, trembling hands). However, there’s little internal contradiction or genuine struggle on the page—she is competent, steady, and largely unopposed. The “invented history becomes memory” shift registers emotionally but doesn’t force a conflicted choice. As a result, the arc reads more as deepening poise than change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: a death-declared wanderer driven to salvage erased lives. Interiority is embodied (the trembling over Elara’s letter) and consistent with their outsider status. The shift from seeker to “guardian of the forgotten” is earned, though internal contradiction is light and largely untested by counter-pressure. More tangible cost or a risk-laden choice would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motivation (myth buster seeking the “ephemeral compass”) meets a credible internal contradiction: she hunts proof yet chooses an intuited truth. Embodied responses—the bow’s urgency, the breath-catching pause at the shell’s glow—reveal micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (accepting impermanence over evidence) reads earned. Some emotional language skews generalized (“voice of the universe”), but not enough to blunt character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her role as “culture shock absorber” gives her purposeful agency. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion are mostly summarized rather than dramatized, limiting depth at decision points. Vorin functions as a flat foil without testing her in scene. The final act (placing the stone) feels earned but low-cost in personal terms.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserve and document before terraforming—reads clean, and the mentor tie-in individualizes her. The micro‑choices (ignoring comms, scanning the message, staying through dawn) align with a curious, dutiful persona. Internal friction (protocol vs. preservation) is present but lightly contested; the cost is mostly implied. Embodied details (glove on pouch, breath fogging visor) ground emotion without deep contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her tactile, nonvisual habits give her interiority a specific texture. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little doubt or cost as she proceeds, which flattens pressure. The traveler’s presence is perfunctory, offering no crucible for relational choice. The final stance (calm endurance as vocation) is credible but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it as she leaves the outpost and follows the mist. Interiority is present but largely linear; contradictory impulses are muted, with little struggle beyond the cold and uncertainty. “Dry‑witted” is not dramatized, and confidence reads as label‑forward rather than costed. The final acceptance/understanding beat is earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and coherent (restore balance through rhythm), and endurance is shown through the “days into weeks” routine. However, interiority is thin and largely generalized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a specific, embodied emotional cost. Elias’s patience functions as a trait more than a friction point. The ending’s choice to stay as “guardian” lands but without a sharpened trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clear want (survive, then discover) and a named counter‑impulse (“override her instinct to flee”), but emotions are largely told rather than embodied. Micro‑choices are summarized, not dramatized under pressure. The final shift to wonder lands, yet it lacks a felt on‑page cost or contradiction resolved in scene. Maya reads competent, but her fear doesn’t visibly degrade perception or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (redeem the family legacy and be believed) is clear and his discovery of the journal credibly reorients his desire from hush to truth. Interiority is specific enough (the lattice as tactile anchor), though moments like “he wanted to be heard” veer toward stated moral. The final renunciation reads earned by prior beats, but the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page. Additional contradiction under pressure (temptation to use hush) could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (repay a lifelong debt) and a credible internal split between longing for freedom and loyalty to the owed bond. The embodied beats—kneeling at the anchor tree, clutching the bead—show pressure on her choices. Some emotional phrasing trends abstract (“lovingly venomous,” “mournful elation”), softening edge specificity. The final step into the night reads earned, though the price remains conceptual rather than concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and steady—she aims to “carve a path from ruin to reverence”—and her actions align with that aim. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotional texture are thin; she rarely feels torn or pressured in the moment. Fatigue is mentioned, but struggle is minimal and generic. The result is purposeful but low‑friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—restoring faith through reconnecting with ancestral legacy—is clear and consistent, and her cautious curiosity informs choices (listening to the land, not rushing). Interiority is textured and embodied, though internal contradiction is mild (curiosity vs restraint) and never forces a sharp trade‑off. The final shift to belonging/purpose is earned but low‑cost. Absence of an on‑page human counterforce limits crucible pressure on character.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lyra’s motive—finding meaning in “margins” through odd codes—is clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (kneeling to trace chalk, racing the dawn, opening the box) align with it. However, internal contradiction is thin; she rarely hesitates or wrestles with the ethical cost of taking the letter. Emotional texture stays generalized (“futuristic nostalgia”) rather than embodied under pressure. The closing shift reads more like confirmation than an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (to listen to the stars; to protect the flame/observatory) are clear and drive her choices (opening the door armed; agreeing to synchronize; working the chart). Interiority is credible if somewhat familiar (“heart quickened”), with a modest tension between suspicion and trust. Lira functions more as an expositional pressure than a fully realized counter‑presence. The closing resolve feels earned but pays little visible cost beyond a conceptual reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her embodied responses (skin prickling, shard humming) keep her anchored in scene. The inner drive to “find the moment before deciding” coheres with the final choice to read the letter. However, contradictory impulses are muted; the path from intent to action encounters little friction, so the change lands more as fulfillment than struggle. The cost is felt but largely internal and lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent, and her interiority is embodied through tactile details (wrist pain, condensation, the coral’s glow). The shrewd innocence vs. necessary hardness tension reads, though it remains mostly asserted rather than tested by a live counterforce. Her micro‑choices (persisting in decryption, deciding to protect the reef, stepping into the night) align with her core drive. The final stance shift to “be its voice” is earned but the on‑page cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation (recover lost joy) is clear and drives concrete choices: following the fog‑path, seeking the network, loading the film, painting the fog. Interiority is embodied (tears, tactile handling of tools), though internal contradiction is mild and largely summarized. The convenient prior knowledge of the “knowledge network” skims struggle, trimming depth. The final shift reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s methodical/playful temperament and restorer identity feel particular, and her pivotal choice to “exchange certainty for curiosity” is motivated by the scene’s pressure. However, the internal conflict is lightly sketched; hesitation registers but resolves too smoothly. Embodied reactions are present but not deeply contradictory. The cost of her choice is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated (protect the Lexicon), competent, and embodied by tactile actions (sketching carvings, hand to dagger). Internal contradiction is thin—he rarely wavers or pays a visible cost beyond anxiety. Dr. Krane adds pressure but their dynamic remains cordial, not crucible-hard. The closing choice (joining the meeting) is aligned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—and actions align (seeking an alcove, persisting for months, singing). Interiority feels character‑particular with credible doubt and endurance (“shyly unstoppable”). The change to understanding “harmony within it” reads earned if a little soft on visible cost. Emotional embodiment leans lyric over granular conflict but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation and motive are clear and embodied in tactile caretaking, and her choice to sing with the Vessel is coherent and earned. However, internal contradiction is light; “foxglove regret” names a mood but does not generate competing impulses at decision points. The emotional cost surfaces through overwhelm and the chime’s destruction, but her struggle remains relatively smooth. Strong presence, modest conflict depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (restore trust) is clear and rooted in her “carefully reckless” flaw, and her fear/confession gives her action moral stakes. Interiority is mostly concrete, with tactile engagement (quill, trembling hands) under pressure. Some phrasing leans generic (“language of her heart”), softening specificity at peak moments. The final exchange with Kael lands as a credible, if gentle, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear motivation (harmonize village and scholars) and professional specificity give Elias credible agency. Interiority tracks through tactile actions (chain, adhesive) and embodied unease (trembling), though struggle feels low‑friction. The solution reads as aligned with his traits but borderline too tidy. A visible personal cost beyond nerves is thin, keeping the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (preserving lost songs) is concrete and consistently embodied through pigeons, dust, and the meteorite. Her contradiction—self‑reinvention via half‑truths vs. a move toward truth—registers and culminates when she starts sending truthful messages. Emotional texture is largely shown through tactile habits rather than label‑speak. The cost of renouncing the old self is implied more than dramatized, keeping the ceiling below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive is coherent and specific—she seeks the meaning of sacred thresholds and resolution regarding her father. Her renunciation at the end (leaving the logbook) is earned by the terrace‑induced memory and the recoded weather entries. Interior texture is mostly embodied through image rather than label, with credible contradiction (she “stopped searching” yet cannot stop seeking meaning). The cost registers, though her struggle feels largely contemplative rather than pressured by concrete counterforces.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—seeking a “rhythm of belonging”—is clear and embodied through her attention to light patterns and the burnt feather. The internal pull between awe (staying to dance) and survival (taking the pod) reads credibly on the page. Some insight phrases verge on declarative thesis, but her micro‑choices under pressure remain character‑specific. The final renunciation (leaving) carries a felt cost and is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s desire to recover and understand a vanished path is clear, embodied by the crater glass and seeds; her micro‑choices (shifting focus from image to emotion) feel motivated. The grief over her grandmother adds credible pressure. The internal turn to acceptance is a touch tidy, with little contradictory impulse on the page beyond brief frustration. Still, reactions align with motive and yield an earned, if gentle, change.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—Elias opposes monotony by “orchestrating serendipity”—and his actions align. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he meets little resistance and seldom reveals competing impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion is present in his “lightly attentive gaze,” but the performance reads assured rather than contested. The ending claims cost (life lived as antidote) without showing a concrete on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling (to inscribe a forbidden verse despite erasure), and her embodied fear/defiance (“hands trembled,” then she refuses to flee) creates credible tension. The micro‑choices—uncorking the vial, dipping the quill, standing with the verse bared—align with her values under pressure. Internal contradiction (longing vs. fear) is present without therapy‑speak. The sentinel functions as external pressure rather than a character, but that’s appropriate to scope.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motive—illuminate the mundane before change arrives—is clear and consistent, and his rituals (prism, ripples) reveal character. However, interiority leans abstract and tidy, with little contradictory impulse or embodied cost. The epiphany in the atrium comes easily, with scant friction or self‑doubt to complicate it. The final decision to “share his reckonings” feels earned but low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt, care for broken things, and survivor’s burden are coherently motivated and embodied in his tactile handling of the box and feather. The final renunciation—letting pain be a language rather than a definition—feels earned by prior beats. However, interiority leans on generalized abstractions (“bargained innocence,” “acceptance”) that dull the bite of contradiction. More in-scene friction or a concrete test of his gentleness under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive (a “logical dreamer” testing hope) is clear and enacted through the tactile making and remaking of patterns under tidal threat. The internal tension between quantifying and feeling registers, though it rarely sharpens into simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure. Her micro‑choices (adjusting to waves, refusing to mourn erasure) align with motive. The change—reframing hope from equation to lived pattern—feels earned if somewhat gently achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear drive (legacy and “what walls dream about”) and embodied perception anchor her choices, but internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible personal price. Micro‑choices—sifting ash, extracting pages, pressing the symbol—align with motive. The closing acceptance of being “their voice” is earned but low‑cost. Strong presence, modest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and her calm resolve under pressure aligns with her method and the closing cost (her faint heartbeat). Interiority is present but spare; the piece leans lyric over conflict-rich contradiction, so we get less simultaneous push–pull beyond serene determination versus physical strain. The trembling hands against a calm face is a strong, character‑specific tell. Change is earned through sacrifice rather than a reconfigured belief, which fits but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and costs are clear and credible, with the ebony clipboard and terrace ritual deepening her interior stakes. Interiority has specificity (clipboard scars, voice breaking), though some abstractions lean generic. Her operatively gentle tactic creates plausible pressure but we get little contradictory impulse beyond fatigue versus conviction. The final endurance feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s contradiction—amoral profiteer driven by guilty preservation—reads cleanly and motivates her choices. Interiority is specific enough (boots on salt, cracks as “blueprint”) to avoid stock psychology. However, the guilt/cost remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized, softening the felt price of her act. Micro-choices exist but are small (kneel, brush salt, place egg) without on‑page pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions (untangling, dancing, releasing) align with it. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she acknowledges cost but rarely struggles against fear or doubt on the page. The “chaste courtesan” paradox intrigues but doesn’t generate live conflict. The final acceptance of consequence reads earned, if somewhat untested.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority (tactile handling of the story stick; doubt vs conviction) motivates a credible shift from provocation to reconstruction. Contradictory impulses are active on the page, and actions align with the new stance. The cost of the choice is more implied than dramatized, keeping the turn a bit safe. Still, the persona (urbane calligrapher who stages puppet shows) feels specific and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—to honor overlooked histories through ritual structures—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (knotting, humming, adding the monarch wing) align with it. Interiority is sensorially filtered and character‑particular, avoiding generic labels. However, internal contradiction is light; we feel unease and resolve, but not a pressured clash of impulses. The final endurance feels earned but carries a modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is clear and embodied through her ritual labor. The self-forgiveness frame provides a credible internal tension, though it remains more declared than dramatized. Micro-choices (unraveling/reweaving threads with “technical gentleness”) align with character. The visible cost is largely emotional and quiet rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority leans abstract and declarative, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion shows up (“heart raced”) yet the piece relies on summarizing states (“had learned to see beyond the surface”). The final realization lands as an idea more than a hard-earned, costly choice. Micro‑choices exist (entering, deciphering), but they feel friction‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s desire is clear and consistent, but his inner conflict is mostly asserted (skeptic vs. seeker) rather than dramatized through hard choices. He discovers the tile quickly and proceeds with little resistance, limiting the sense of pressure on his motives. The embodied cost of “devotion and sacrifice” remains abstract. The final stance shift reads, but without a concrete trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming and Kael’s defensive resentment are clear, and her tactic-driven micro-choices (music box, memory induction) track with motive. Kael’s brief softening then recoil provides credible ambivalence, but interiority remains generalized (“resentment is heavy”) rather than embodied. The final shift (“How do I start?”) is earned but light on visible cost. Dialogue differentiates them adequately without deep idiolect.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s desire (grounded craftswoman pursuing a runaway dream) is clean and consistent, with credible micro‑choices—accepting the task, syncing breath, stepping into the orchard. The internal contradiction (firmly grounded vs. yearning for the impossible) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressed into visible cost. Emotions are embodied through work—breath, lantern light, frost—more than introspective thinking. The final stance shift reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive (repairing the vow/bridging wisdom) is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with objects reveals character. However, contradictory impulses are minimal and the epiphany (“Perhaps the breach wasn’t a failure…”) arrives neatly, with limited on‑page struggle. The “endearingly feisty” trait is mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. The final choice feels emotionally credible but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s drive to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and consistent, and her bewilderment-to-purpose arc reads credibly. Interiority is textured (the orchard “breathes,” the cameo’s shifting etchings), though contradictory impulses under pressure are limited. Her few micro-choices (entering the bathroom, questioning the woman) align with motive but face little friction. The final acceptance lacks a visible cost that would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s competence and motivation are clear, but interior contradiction is thin; she rarely doubts or pays a felt personal price. Her “carefully resourceful” nature shows in decoding and negotiation, not in conflicted impulses. Kael adds pressure but doesn’t force a relational crucible. The final bargain lands without visible cost that would reconfigure her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and flaw set are clear (drawn to anomalies, incomplete without Lyra), and her micro‑choices—reading the threads, following the glow, hesitating at the door—track with her motivation. The hesitation at the threshold offers genuine internal friction, but some interiority leans abstract (“unkindled solace,” “blissfully aberrant”) rather than embodied. The final acceptance reads earned, though the cost (letting the card dissolve, relinquishing a fixed self‑story) is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her hands‑on choices (deciphering the seal, rebraiding the rope, stepping through) align with her “warmly methodical” nature. However, internal contradiction and felt ambivalence are minimal; she encounters little psychological friction. Emotions are mostly inferred through environment rather than embodied specificity. The final stance (keeper-archivist to discoverer) lands, but at a low emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal; Lira proceeds competently with little friction or contradictory impulse. Embodied moments (clutching the stone, weariness at the end) hint at cost but never force a fraught trade. Her method reveals character, yet decisions rarely test values against fear or doubt. The guardianship at the end reads earned but emotionally light.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—drives tangible choices and culminates in a costly sacrifice. Interiority is specific enough (telescope work, trembling, hesitation before the ritual) to feel embodied, though some phrasing trends abstract. The memory‑sacrifice hesitation provides credible internal conflict. A touch more idiosyncratic, character‑particular perception would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her methodical actions (calipers, notebooks), and the “preemptively nostalgic” trait colors her worldview. However, internal contradiction is limited—she rarely faces a value conflict or real self‑doubt under pressure. Her key micro‑choices (following the wing’s shadow; touching the fog) track with motive and reveal competence more than struggle. The endurance cost (melancholy burden) is present but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s motive and agency are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (dipping, spinning, arranging, reigniting) align with that drive. However, she faces little internal contradiction or doubt; resolve never truly frays under pressure. Emotions are largely asserted via lyrical register rather than embodied conflict. The ending earns a small endurance cost (fatigue, smudged hands) but not a tested renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to apprehend time’s texture and vindicate her method—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (slipping away, staying with the cicada, returning to Kael) align. Interiority is particular and sensorial rather than diagnostic. However, internal contradiction is low-pressure: her conflict with Kael is off-stage, so we don’t feel her worldview truly tested. The final shift from “seeking” to “belonging” lands but with a soft, largely conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and hunger for “flavors of silence” create a distinctive, coherent drive that motivates concrete choices (training, packing, climbing). Her embodied fear shows in tight corridors, shallow breaths, and trembling hands, not just labels. The doll functions as a charged mirror of her resilience and maternal tie, prompting a micro‑choice when it slips. The final internal shift (the bunker can no longer hold her) feels earned, though the personal cost is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s mission is clear and enacted through concrete choices (steering to a quieter sector; selecting the floating garden), and Mira’s restlessness credibly softens. However, internal contradiction and cost are light: Mira’s shift feels swift and minimally contested. Dialogue carries warmth and subtext but edges toward platitude in the final exchange. The relationship dynamic is gentle and functional rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivations are clear and consistent, and her puzzle‑solving choices reveal a competent, cautious curiosity in action. Interiority is present but leans generic at times, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The deadline and the lure of the throne rarely create visible internal conflict beyond determination. The final renunciation lands, but the felt cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—guard the sanctuary and transform darkness—culminating in a credible sacrifice (severing a scar-link). Interiority carries some specificity (scars glimmering, trembling after), though the mantra “teach suffocating to breathe” stays abstract and repeats. The internal conflict (protect all links vs. burn one) is present but could be dramatized earlier for sharper contradiction. Actions align with her values and the cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s choices drive the piece (replying to the texts, stepping through the portal, activating the machine), but her interior conflict is light and largely labeled rather than dramatized. “Virtuously mischievous” surfaces in action once, with minimal cost. The pyramid-scheme backstory flavors motive but seldom pressures on-page decisions. The closing stance shift toward responsibility/hope is credible, if a touch easy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but Eleanor’s agency is limited to initiating the gramophone and accepting the revelation. Interiority is present yet tidy, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The emotional cost is named more than felt. The final stance shift (keeper of truth rather than savior) is earned but light.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric’s interiority is clear and particular—withdrawn, yet compelled by the talisman and the vines—culminating in the choice to shed the gauntlet and accept a new allegiance. Contradictory impulses (retreat vs. reach) play in scene rather than as labels. The change lands credibly, though the visible cost remains modest (a gauntlet and a talisman’s dissolution rather than a sharper trade-off). Emotional embodiment is steady and character-specific without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to salvage humanity from bureaucracy—is clear and her archivist habits concretize it (dust-reading, cross-referencing). Interiority is specific enough to feel lived (button, ribbon, unsent letter) with a credible, quiet yearning. Internal contradiction exists but is mild: grief-bruise versus hopeful method. The closing stance shift to purpose is earned, though the felt cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, consistent drive and embodied resolve (boots sinking, fingers on the key) create credible motivation under pressure. Adaptive choice at the crunch—broadcast instead of flight—aligns with her resourcefulness. Internal contradiction is light; fear vs. purpose shows, but we don’t see a deeper value clash or flaw tested. The “underestimated rebel” identity is told as much as shown, limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is explicit and steady—he plays to hush a coded prophecy—but interior contradiction is minimal and largely summarized (“He knew the only way…”). The piece favors external ritual over embodied ambivalence, so micro‑choices read as predetermined persistence rather than pressured trade‑offs. Emotional texture appears (breath, effort), but cost is light and un-particular to him. A credible endurance arc lands, but without a felt internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and rooted in family duty and folklore, and her micro‑choices (pocketing the speck, building an altar, researching) align with those motives. Interiority is particular enough to feel lived, but internal conflict is minimal and largely untested on the page. The “chosen” realization lands, yet it lacks a visible competing impulse or tangible cost. Emotional embodiment is steady but rarely contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    The tinkerer’s motives are coherent and consistent—his shift from control to discovery tracks—but internal contradiction is lightly sketched and rarely stress‑tested. He meets minimal resistance; choices (follow compass, descend, return the map) come easily. Embodied emotion appears (frustration, pull toward the compass) but leans on aphoristic phrasing. The renunciation (leaving the map, abandoning precision for mystery) lands, though the felt cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—understanding the weight of names through redeeming the coin—is clear and consistent, and her hesitation at the furnace reads as a credible, character‑specific test. Interiority is mostly concrete (warm coin, kintsugi flask) with a few abstract slips. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are present but the cost of her final acceptance is modest. The arc lands, though it feels more principled than personally risky.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives (to listen/heal) are clear and her choices (listen instead of take; intensify playing; keep the tooth) align with them. Interiority is present but mostly generalized ache rather than contradictions under pressure. The shadow-father gets one clean beat of vulnerability that humanizes him. The final acceptance of emotional cost lands but feels relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and history are clear and embodied through tactile interactions with the forest and the strap, and the final relinquishment enacts a credible shift. However, the interiority leans on abstract, therapy-adjacent phrasing (“mathematics of mercy,” “trauma responses”) that softens contradiction and risk. Internal conflict exists but is streamlined toward a neat realization rather than a jagged struggle. Still, micro-choices (standing, moving deeper, releasing the strap) align with motive and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to honor overlooked histories—and her actions align (deciphering the painting, choosing to descend, working through the night). Interiority is specific to her vocation, though internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a felt emotional price beyond effort. The micro-choices (spotting the spiral, unfastening the frame, following the map) reveal competence more than conflict. The final endurance (staying through dawn) lands, but the cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motive (compelled fixer drawn by ghosts/ceilings) is clear and drives action, and his trade-skill habits (dust, mechanics) inform choices. Interiority is adequate but low on contradiction; he rarely wavers or pays a palpable price beyond a chill and tension. The young ghost is a cue, not a relationship crucible. The final “weightless burden” note gestures at cost/duty but stops short of dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her actions align with it (uncorking the bottle, choosing to descend). However, internal contradiction is minimal—she faces little friction beyond awe—so the arc reads smooth rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion shows in tactile moments (gloved hand on frost) but rarely complicates her resolve. The final acceptance of caretaker status feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (redemption via proving “temporal plasticity”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (sneaking into the Hall, covering mirrors, aligning the shard) align with that drive. Interiority shows texture (the shard’s rainbows; “burnished sorrow”) but contradictory impulses are underplayed on the page, mostly told rather than dramatized against live resistance. The “defunct revolutionary” identity informs stance but faces little direct relational pressure in scene. The bittersweet endurance at the end reads earned but not deeply contested in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (curiosity, duty) and a few micro‑hesitations, but interiority stays mostly lyrical-summary rather than embodied under pressure. Elias’s key choice—free, not fix—reads motivated yet lightly contested. Secondary characters apply minimal on‑page pressure. Emotional cost is present (magic spent) but not deeply felt through body or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (seeking the place where explanations fail) is clear and coherently pursued, and the heirloom compass and psychometry reveal personal stakes. Embodied perceptions (petrichor, tingling stone, heart quickening) give her interiority a lived texture. However, contradictory impulses are faint—the choice to let the compass sink arrives with little resistance or costed hesitation. The renunciation reads true but a shade too serene to expose deeper fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, and Mara makes a few micro‑choices (entering, placing the slide). However, interiority trends abstract (“scaffold complexity with simplicity”) with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The “Reimagine” mantra substitutes for a more specific conflict in her mind. The final identity shift lands but without a felt cost that reveals deeper flaw or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive is lucid and consistent, and her decisions (traveling to the cathedral, painting through the night) align with motive. Interiority is textured but skews abstract, with little contradictory impulse under on‑page pressure. The change at the end feels earned but soft, with minimal visible cost beyond effort and solitude. Absence of a relational crucible limits complexity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s drive is clear and coherent—an archivist compelled to honor erased voices—and her actions (the ritual, the parley) align with that motive. Interiority is textured if somewhat generalized; grief/determination reads more as steady posture than actively clashing impulses. Micro-choices under pressure are present but modest. The final stance—hopeful commitment—feels earned, if low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her renunciation of nostalgia gives her a credible stance. However, conflict is largely internal and lightly tested; the magic responds without resistance, so contradictory impulses don’t bite. The cost—choosing to leave—registers, but feels modest given the scale. Interiority leans abstract at key beats (“revival meant creation, not replication”), limiting character‑particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (archiving emotional patterns) is clear and coherently drives every choice from fitting the wax shaving to speaking the dead language. Interiority is grounded in sensory perception and vocation, though internal contradiction is limited—she moves from curiosity to resolve without much friction. The final “I remember” credibly crystallizes her stance but carries minimal visible cost. Still, her decisions align with her role and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motivation and embodied presence (breath in frigid air, acorn cap in palm) work, but internal contradiction remains label-level (“furiously tranquil”) rather than dramatized in choice. She encounters little resistance; opening the arch and stepping through read as straightforward. The final acceptance of responsibility is emotionally apt but low-cost. Interiority is specific, though epiphany comes too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation—to listen rather than blare—drives his attention and the rope‑pulling choice, and his embodied responses (trembling, pulse alignment) read specific. However, internal contradiction is light; there’s little friction between duty (sirens) and desire (listening) at the decision point. The role shift to “keeper” lands, but the on‑page cost of that redefinition remains understated. Strong, coherent interiority without a sharp conflict spine.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira reads as a distinct, grounded presence with clear curiosity and quiet pride; her choices (lifting the glass, following coordinates, renouncing the lantern at the end) align with that core. Interiority is specific in places (“flourishing stillness” as a paradox she earns via the star‑map), though contradictions under pressure are light. Emotional embodiment leans lyrical rather than tense, so the felt cost of her shift is gentle. Still, the endurance/renunciation at the end is credibly earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias is consistent and gently compelling, but his interiority skews declarative over conflicted; he shifts from recluse to guardian with little on‑page resistance. The decisive ritual reads as a given rather than a choice paid for with a visible cost. Embodied noticing is strong (“light through broken glass,” “faint hum of bees”), yet contradictory impulses rarely collide in scene. The closing peace feels earned emotionally but minimally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—repair time and decode the fragment—and she makes consequential choices (garage‑sale gambit; activating the weaver). Interiority is serviceable but not deep; her “borrowed-time” bind and fear are told more than felt. The relationship with Thaddeus adds warmth but little pressure. The closing sense of belonging is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s interiority and motives are clear and embodied—her “harmonizing discord” manifests in how she arranges thoughts, engages the wanderer, and tends the kite. The man’s loss (“forgot how to find it”) sets a credible relational pressure that she meets with the offered feather. Contradictory impulses are mild but present (guarding the talisman vs. giving it). The feather remaining in his hand at the end implies a small but real cost that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—six months to live redirects Elias from caretaking to legacy building—and his actions (methodical wrapping, documenting, final entry) align. However, interior contradiction is thin; “brazen calm” never frays, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The acceptance at the end reads earned but low-cost on the page. The character feels particular, but largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s desire “to understand the chemistry of homecoming” is clear and tracked through embodied, scene‑anchored beats (the ascent, the encounter, the placing of amber). The skeptic/fascinated contradiction is credible and present in micro‑choices (she resists questioning the pilgrim; she ultimately participates in the ritual). The final softening reads earned, though the felt cost (what she surrenders in identity or method) remains understated. Secondary pressure is minimal but appropriate for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—he plants to let a garden reclaim a battlefield—but conflicting impulses are faint, so pressure never forces a hard trade. Interiority is lyrical and character‑specific (dead languages, bird‑guided work), yet the coachman faces little resistance. Micro‑choices (where to plant, when to stop, to leave) reveal values but don’t cost him much. The earned endurance is gentle rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and history as a “bloodhound” motivate a credible return to the factory, and his quiet renunciation of solitude at the end reads earned. However, internal conflict is muted; the riddle yields with little resistance and we see limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The relationship with Lira adds warmth but exerts minimal on‑page pressure. A slightly deeper cost to choosing connection would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (to embrace her “true north” and transform confusion into exploration) is clear and consistent, and her sketching functions as a concrete tactic. However, interior conflict remains largely abstract; the pariah cost is stated more than felt and micro‑choices beyond “draw/continue” are limited. The epiphany reads mildly pre‑ordained, dampening surprise. Still, the tactile attention to the compass and the sketchpad gives her some embodied presence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motive (restore the sky) and chivalrous code are clear, and the rediscovery of his “sacredly playful” nature offers a credible internal pivot. However, interiority is summarized rather than embodied; we’re told he feels wonder again, but we rarely see contradictory impulses collide on the page. The chess sacrifice gestures at cost but remains largely symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s desire “to become the historian of small gestures” is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (touching the pawnless board, choosing to walk). Her internal conflict (performance vs. authenticity) is credible and culminates in a believable renunciation. Embodiment is somewhat abstract at times, relying on conceptual language over sensory texture. Kael functions as a pressure and mirror, though his depth is label‑heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (to understand the shape of home) and tangible micro‑choices (taking the stone, using the feather memory) anchor Elara. The push‑pull between the pain of remembering and the need to recover self registers but remains largely abstract. The epiphany lands a bit too smoothly, with limited visible cost beyond affective strain. Still, interiority is consistent and embodied through the object work enough to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—an exiled chess tutor seeking self‑forgiveness through a tactically minded, tactile engagement with the tapestry. The chess‑driven cognition and fidgeting give her interiority texture, and micro‑choices (decoding, entering, pulling the thread) align with her competence. Internal contradiction is mild—hesitation registers but pressure rarely exposes competing impulses. The change (quiet resolve; fidgeting ceases) feels earned if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motive to refract forgiveness is clear and consistent with her defiant streak, and her choices (approaching, touching, persisting) align under pressure. We get embodied emotion—the humming spire, chest‑pressed echoes—rather than label‑only feelings. Internal contradiction (cautious approach vs. rebellious purpose) is present but could cut sharper in a moment of near‑refusal. The final renunciation (surrendering a shard of herself) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging identity and meaning—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (aligning the charm, narrating under pressure). Interior contradiction is mild; she’s uncertain but largely unwavering, limiting complexity. Embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath work) lands; “kintsugi intentions” risks label‑speak but is partially dramatized via the pockmarks. The ending shows credible endurance and stance crystallization, though the cost feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (fulfilling a hidden promise through art) is clear and drives her key choices, culminating in the decision to reveal herself via the painting. The internal friction—aloofness versus the need to share—registers, with embodied beats like trembling hands. However, interiority leans on abstractions (“essence of her journey,” “temporary eternity”) that blur specificity and dampen felt cost. The final renunciation of aloofness reads credible but a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is grounded in tactile perception (scent, stone, the hum), and his micro‑choices (sniffing the cork, raising a hand, following the beckon) track his motivation to validate the quiet. The “screaming tenderness” line embodies contradiction well. The transformation lands, but the epiphany’s ease borders on tidy. Minimal friction or cost in the follow-through keeps the arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (to trust the calls, to scavenge and build) align with those traits. Interiority is present but largely summarized; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied cues (raw hands, moon-timed work) help but the emotional field stays tidy. The shift from isolation to communal anchor is believable, if achieved with minimal on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—protecting psychological safety—drives clear choices (taking the eye, seeking Mara, returning it), and his single involuntary confession reveals a real pressure point. However, his path to resolution is smooth, with little messy contradiction or degradation under stress beyond that one slip. The healer’s quick guidance reduces on‑page struggle, keeping his interior conflict from compounding. Still, his restraint and rationality feel character‑particular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—decode the stranger’s gesture and tend to the “gaps.” Interiority is concrete (boot print, mist, tactile journal) and reveals character through methodical choices. Contradictory impulses are light; he rarely wrestles with true hesitation or competing desires. The closing acceptance reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and loneliness motivate clear actions (following the ants, touching the arch), but he accepts the “chosen guardian” role without friction, softening interior conflict. Interiority is serviceable yet generalized; we get little contradiction between fear and desire at the portal moment. The final shift to “purpose” lands, but the cost feels abstract. More embodied doubt or sacrifice would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (answers to dreams; pull toward the grotto) and actions align under pressure. Embodied fear vs duty registers in small beats (crunching boots, metallic scent) but internal contradiction remains modest and resolves neatly. The vow reads earned yet a touch tidy, with limited visible cost beyond acceptance of responsibility. Still, the queen’s micro‑choices (pressing on, calling out, vowing) credibly chart change.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motivation—“to capture the density of presence”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (the chant, the ritual) align. However, there’s little internal contradiction or visible cost; she faces no meaningful doubt or competing impulse. The relationship with Kael warms the scene but doesn’t pressure her choices. Emotional texture is embodied but leans declarative in peak beats (“This is what it means...”).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive to “distill chaos into narrative” is clear and consistent, and her jealousy of past selves provides a credible internal contradiction. Embodied details (birch bark, kerosene lamp, trembling hands) ground the interiority. The turn—choosing to enter the dreamspace and then to accept the reframe—feels earned if a touch tidy. The cost is mostly internal (relinquishing envy), which reads but remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to dignify the overlooked despite anosmia) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices: taking the screw, asking “May I?”, and reading its charge. Embodied details (hands tremble with a “trembling calm,” warmth in the metal) ground her interiority. The change—reframing her loss as a different map—feels earned if quiet. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than a felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and motivated: fear versus scholarship plays out through embodied beats (the quill crystallizing, the breath practice). The motivation “transform scars into stories” coheres with her actions in the ceremony. Change is earned via revisiting superstition as a tool rather than a belief. The cost is modest—confronting anxiety rather than sacrificing something material—but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—an overdue apology via a haunted heirloom—is clear and propulsive, with embodied emotion in the tactile handling of the bottle. Internal tension exists (duty vs. regret), though contradictory impulses could be sharper under pressure. Her micro‑choice to channel the apology as a current feels earned by the setup. The orchard’s impending loss provides a quiet cost that keeps the change from reading pat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (unravel illusions/unify) and consistent, but the interiority often stays at an abstract register, limiting embodied pressure and contradictory impulses. Micro-choices exist (tracing the mural, trusting the dictionary, closing eyes), yet none carry visible cost. The “wanderingly exact” trait reads label-first rather than dramatized under strain. The transformation at the end feels earned conceptually, not emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s drive to “understand what clocks really measure” is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (staying after the whistle, counting down, testing the hidden slot) align with that motive. Interiority is present though tilted toward abstraction, with embodiment limited to a few gestures (“calloused hands,” “heart pounded”). The epiphany arrives conveniently via a parchment that articulates the thesis, reducing the sense of earned struggle. Change is credible but the cost of renouncing his prior frame is faint on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s conflicting impulses—guarding vs. letting go—are credible and embodied in small choices (following non‑human prints, not firing, taking the mushroom). Her father’s influence creates a coherent motive thread that culminates in a believable reorientation. The emotional range stays controlled but specific; fear and recognition coexist in the clearing. The cost—relinquishing a rigid identity as “intrusion detector”—is present, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive and contradictions are clear and consistent, embodied in small actions (handling the lantern, copying scrawls, choosing to write). The interiority occasionally leans abstract (“widen perspectives responsibly,” “theoretical rebellion”) but remains character‑specific through her father’s shadow. Change is modest but earned—she reframes her father’s contradictions into guidance. The visible cost is subdued (accepting unanswered questions), which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s guarded isolation (“cultivated estrangement”) is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices—the refusal to play the disc, the hesitant testing of a note, finally the call he’s avoided. Embodied unease (the disc slipping, breath steadying) grounds the interior turn. The closing choice feels earned by prior pressure, though “I’m ready to begin” edges toward tidiness. Still, the throughline from fear to vulnerable initiation holds.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (to preserve small moments) is clear and consistent, and her choice to seek Mara and to document at the end aligns with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the piece lacks a live tension between competing impulses. Emotions are largely labeled or serene rather than embodied under pressure. The final stance (to participate in regeneration) is earnest but arrives without visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (find a cure for loneliness) is clear and consistent, and the moon‑rock talisman grounds her interiority. The “desperately jocular” trait is asserted but rarely dramatized under pressure, so contradictions never fully spark in-scene. Her choice to touch the clock aligns with motive but risks an epiphanic neatness. The closing shift (laughter no longer a shield) lands but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular, and her sensory‑anchored interiority feels lived. However, pressure rarely forces contradictory impulses to collide; she meets little resistance en route to the stillpoint. The epiphany, while resonant, edges toward tidy. Strong embodiment and object‑reaction (the ring) keep choices aligned with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to uncover and “thresh meaning”) is clear and consistent, and her choices—approaching, entering, writing—align with it. The “confidently uncertain” paradox is intriguing but remains more label than dramatized internal conflict. Interiority is present but leans on generalities rather than sharp, character‑particular contradictions under pressure. The resolution costs her little beyond relinquishing the pen’s power, so the change feels modest but credible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (signing, attending to the camera, resuming with “new purpose”) align under pressure. The contradictory impulse of wanting to be felt while accepting being forgotten surfaces credibly in the “remembered—if only by herself” beat. Interiority leans declarative at times (“Her goal was to disrupt”), softening the lived specificity of conflict. Still, the final endurance and redefinition of voice read earned with a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive and steady agency, but limited internal contradiction or real struggle; the arsonist rarely faces a pressured micro‑choice. “Volcanic tenderness” reads more as a label than an embodied conflict. Competence carries them through a frictionless puzzle‑path. The emotional turn at the scroll lands but at low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete (the grounding through drumming, the “auroral sorrow”) and her micro‑choices track: approaching the lagoon, perching, listening, accepting a new purpose. The contradiction—guinea pig vs. quietly rebellious agent—is present and resolved in action. The epiphany’s ease edges toward tidy, but it’s at least partially earned by the lagoon responding to her rhythm. The final commitment to find others is motivated by the revaluation of the “entangled memories.”

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eli’s interiority—loneliness, tactile attunement to footsteps, and cautious curiosity—grounds credible choices under pressure. The motivation to “prove whispers travel farther than shouts” aligns with their temperament and crystallizes at the challenge. However, internal conflict is lightly sketched; fear, doubt, and cost are present but muted. Mira’s status shift (taunting to respectful) adds crucible pressure but could bite harder.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    The guardian’s motive is clear and consistent, and their tactic—silent attention and shutter‑weaving—aligns with it. Interiority remains sparse; the guardian’s inner contradictions and felt costs are implied rather than dramatized. The stranger’s confession supplies emotional texture, but their specificity is limited. The closing nod and lightened shoulders suggest an earned, quiet shift without deepened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent, but Elias encounters little resistance, so contradictory impulses never truly grind. Interiority is present yet generalized; emotions lean conceptual rather than embodied. His ability and vocation inform intent, not difficult micro-choices. The ending shows pride, not a felt price or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guardedness versus grace is clear and embodied in tactile work details and her choice to drop the scrimshaw. Motivation (to embrace her true nature) coheres through the dream and the island. The final renunciation reads earned, with the loss of the scrimshaw and surrender of defenses as cost. Slight neatness to the epiphany keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s inner contradiction—blank performance vs. private grief—reads specific and embodied through the whittling, the window touch, and the secret narration. Motivation (survive the mandate while honoring her brother) is clear and consistent. The piece earns a quiet endurance choice at the end with visible cost implied by the brother’s fate. A slight telliness in framing her “morally ambiguous” status limits deeper ambiguity-on-the-page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV interiority is present and embodied (touching the quartz, voice as conduit), but contradictory impulses are faint; the poet moves steadily toward transcendence with little on-page resistance. Motivation (to cross sacred boundaries) is clear and actions align, yet cost reads mostly as abstract surrender. Few micro-choices under pressure beyond entering, touching, and speaking. Strong atmosphere occasionally substitutes for character-specific contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (arranging plants, deciding to test the concertina as barter) align with his character. Interiority is concrete and filtered through his sensory limits. True contradictory impulses are faint; the struggle is more reorientation than conflict. The final acceptance reads earned but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and consistent, and her choice to use the lamp lens organizes the piece. However, internal contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are minimal; she encounters little resistance beyond fatigue. Emotional texture leans summary over embodied struggle. The ending’s renewed purpose reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-driven motive is clear and specific, with credible micro-choices (tracing the stencil, approaching the curtains, pressing the stencil to skin). The internal contradiction—hesitating to ink yet yearning for connection—feels earned. Embodiment is present (scent of blooms, warmth) without therapy-speak. The final recommitment shows cost as acceptance of pain, though the struggle on the peak beat is relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and methodical nature motivate clear, goal-driven action, and Mira applies concrete pressure. Interiority is present but rarely contradictory; Elara seldom wrestles with competing impulses beyond diligence vs. fatigue. Choices mostly concern analysis rather than ethically fraught decisions with visible cost. Still, reactions to the Tower and the tape reveal a character-specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and embodied through tactile actions (tracing bronze, kneeling, whispering the word). The anguish/joy contradiction is credible and sustained. However, the cost to her innocence remains mostly asserted rather than dramatized in a concrete loss. The final shift reads earned but not costly enough to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—an obsessive archivist compelled by twilight thresholds and forgotten things—and her final choice grows from those traits. The interiority is textured (stone as talisman; pull toward the shadow), though contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity, destruction vs. preservation) surface more as statements than dramatized struggle. The peak action feels relatively unresisted, minimizing visible cost in the moment. Still, the renunciation of the stone and “luminous regret” give a credible, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is clear and consistent, with tactile touches (cedar scent, arranging tools) grounding her. However, the conflict often lives in abstracted language (“balance self-respect and compassion,” “fragile convictions”) rather than dramatized contradictory impulses. The key micro-choices—repatterning her tools and shelving the tail tip—are meaningful but low-pressure. The emotional turn is credible but edges toward tidy self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—closure through recovering memory and meaning—drives clear choices (attending to the coffee rings, obeying the plants, entering the tunnel). Interiority is present and specific (plants’ whispers, tactile hourglass), but contradictory impulses are mild; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible emotional price on the page. The final reconfiguration is earned, though the path feels smooth. Strong alignment of actions to motives, light on struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—seeking where unused love is stored—and her humility around “crystal gazer” adds specificity. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tactile contact with the railing and film) and her decision to take the strip shows agency. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure are lightly sketched rather than dramatized. The cost of the final choice is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive (freeing “remembered stardust” to revive her village) is clear and consistent, and her embodied responses—fear/exhilaration, breath in the crisp air, hands on the cold brass—read specific. The gift/curse tension and “shadowed rapture” supply credible contradiction without over-explaining. Micro-choices (going to the archway, tracing stars, choosing to rest) align with her aims. The internal conflict is evocative but remains low-stakes in-scene, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (cultivate the sparks) and her actions align, but internal conflict is minimal and costs are soft. Interiority leans general (“felt important”) rather than character‑specific. The “dreamless freight guard” identity never pressures choices beyond the title. The closing stance shift (cultivate → protect divergence) lands but isn’t paid through on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear—Eamon seeks meaning/insight—and his choice to place the gear credibly culminates his drift toward purpose. Interiority is often evocative but leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The decisive micro‑choice (inserting the gear) lands, though the felt cost is light. Emotions are embodied at times (“vibration in his chest”) but trend toward elevated summary.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive—seeking the unused courage—is clear and embodied in small, credible choices (taking the ferry, ascending, accepting the punch). Interiority is vivid if somewhat streamlined; contradictory impulses are present but mild (hesitation vs. resolve). The ferryman exerts apt, enigmatic pressure without overpowering her agency. The final shift reads earned, though the emotional cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive to “remain” is clear, and his inner conflict between safety and truth crystallizes at the bolt. The micro-choices—following the stain, opening the sealed door, touching the bolt, choosing to play—track to a credible shift. Some interior beats lean declarative (“to understand the cost of safety”), trimming spontaneity. Still, the final renunciation/embrace (remaining by choice, not duty) reads earned with a felt, if mostly conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistently pursued, and her ingenuity with marginalia reveals character through tactic. However, interior contradiction is thin—she exhibits little doubt or cost, and the confrontation resolves without meaningful psychological friction. Her “diminutive titan” identity is evocative but not stress‑tested on the page. The pretender’s psychology is sketched via annotations but remains largely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity, vocation, and calming tap‑rhythm habit create a coherent, particular interiority and motivate her investigation of the torn page. The micro‑choices (ignoring the page, then returning; assembling fragments) track credibly to a conceptual shift. Emotional texture leans reflective rather than conflicted, so contradiction under pressure is muted. Still, her final repricing of “why paths disappear” feels earned by the on‑page process.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s desire to recover purpose is clear and embodied (bare feet on cracked concrete, the inherited opera glasses). The “awkward confidence” reads particular and consistent, and her micro‑choices—kneeling to the stone, testing the glasses indoors—track to motive. The internal turn from drift to resolve lands, but the felt cost is soft, with little friction or contradiction dramatized in the moment. A touch of abstracted articulation (“Lira’s motivation was clear”) flattens interior nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear—Mara seeks to unseal the embryo to restore culture—and her telepathic apprehension adds texture and specific interiority. The brief guard encounter provides a status shift but dissolves quickly, limiting pressure on her contradictory impulses (fear vs mission). Her final commitment reads earned, though the felt cost remains mostly conceptual. A touch more embodied struggle at the peak would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zara’s motives and interiority are clear, embodied by the crumpled photo and the cliffside retrieval. The near‑fall compresses contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to hold on to family) into a credible, physical test. A few abstract terms (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”) flirt with therapy‑speak and slightly tidy the epiphany. Still, the final artistic choice reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering creative agency by “descending into necessary darkness”—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile choices (sorting cards, redesigning approach, leaving the box behind). Interiority is specific and embodied (salt, groaning walls, trembling hands), not generic. The final renunciation of control feels earned, though the epiphany edges tidy. No secondary characters to pressure her, but the grandmother’s remembered admonition functions as a useful internal counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive (understanding her brother’s death/time distortions) drives clear micro‑choices—launching the drone, entering the tent, touching the vial. The serene anger contradiction reads on the page and turns into a quieter resolve. The change is earned via the vision’s cost (tears, refusal to look away). Minor softness: the guide’s dialogue sketches the insight a bit too neatly, reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty versus the letter’s allure—are embodied (trembling fingers, breath in the cold) and drive concrete micro‑choices (breaking the seal, descending, initiating the transfer). Her motivation remains clear and consistent, escalating under time pressure. A few on‑the‑nose statements (“Her motivation was clear...”) flatten nuance slightly. The final charged poise shows a credible cost without false neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s pacifism versus pragmatic survival is credible, with a clear value hierarchy shown when she accepts the blade but vows restraint. The interiority leans abstract (“weave continuity through chaos”) rather than sharply embodied in key beats, softening impact. The relationship with Kael introduces status and moral pressure without melodrama. A cost is implied—she carries a weapon she dislikes—but the struggle resolves a bit too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear, consistent motive (catch the goddess’s echo) and a calm, tactile POV anchor Kael, but the interior contradiction is thin and the success comes with little visible struggle. Micro-choices (closing eyes, mirroring the zigzag, “listening”) are present yet low-cost. The late reveal of the spike as “key” reads earned but pain-free. The cost—accepting only the echo while the goddess departs—lands, but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Eleanor’s compulsion to uncover truth propels every beat. Interiority skews summary and tidy (“her motivation… felt like a burden”), with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The tea scene hints at status play, but it’s summarized rather than dramatized. The closing resolve reads earned but low-cost, with little on‑page struggle to expose her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and the choice to answer the letters “as the child” is a meaningful, revealing action. Interiority is specific (firmware whispers, amber focus) and avoids generic labels. The resolution is a touch tidy, with limited on‑page resistance to the deciding act. Still, the emotional cost of engaging the letters reads credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motive (to find meaning amid the “unlearning”) drives clear micro‑choices—taking the flake, inserting it, asking the grotto. The “lilac unease” provides a live, contradictory pressure against her purpose. The final renunciation of a single meaning is a credible, felt cost for this character. A touch more behavioral specificity under peak pressure would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is clear and consistent, and her tactile choices with the mosaic align with it. The internal contradiction—gentle radicalism with a “warm and cold” heart—registers but is explored more as assertion than dramatized struggle. Micro‑choices (brushing ash, selecting a gleaming tessera, rearranging pieces) are present but face little on‑page pushback. The endurance/change at the end feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive (“to lure possibility from the brink of despair”) is clear and consistent, and her agency (summoning, offering the coin) aligns with it. Interiority is felt through sensory bias and the coin-as-anchor, but contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal. The despairing double introduces relational charge, yet resistance is low and the change costs Mara little beyond bittersweet endurance. The final renunciation—accepting ongoing encores—reads, but it’s not heavily contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is coherent—an affectionate skeptic moved by unease to make a light painting that “maps” broken and repairable connections. Interiority is specific to her tactile, visual habits (geode against chest, lighting choices), though conflict remains gentle: skepticism versus hope, more posture than clash. Actions align with motives across micro‑choices (setup, mirror placement, all‑night work). The ending earns a stance shift, but the cost is light and largely contemplated.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity and professional rigor motivate her clearly, and her shift from technician to “storyteller” tracks. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; she rarely faces a pressured trade‑off. The most revealing beat is her choice to follow the floating fossil into the depths, but it isn’t tested by resistance. Emotional embodiment is present but leans on familiar phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s goal and methods are clear, with some embodied detail (trembling hands), but internal contradiction and felt cost remain thin. Her competence faces little real friction, so change reads as a gentle resolve rather than an earned renunciation. The final decision to carry the wisdom forward is coherent but minimally pressured by on‑page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and internal contradiction (cautious after being “burned” yet compelled to act) are clear and embodied in micro‑choices—following the snow codes, opening the pillbox, choosing not to take the pill. The letter catalyzes a credible internal shift without feeling convenient. Cost is present but subtle, mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Strong single‑POV interiority avoids stock therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“distill complexity into essence”) and a steady interior lens, but internal contradiction is minimal and the figure’s pressure is gentle. The coachman’s micro-choices (attend, interpret, accept) align with his trait of attentiveness. Emotional embodiment is present (grip on reins/needle, bodily stillness) yet leans abstract at key beats. The final acceptance reads earned, though the felt cost is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and her methodical choices (studying sun patterns, using the glass) track with her “sharp gentleness.” Internal contradiction is minimal; the epiphany arrives cleanly without much felt friction or moral cost. The shift from solitary inquiry to communal stewardship lands but feels tidy. More embodied pressure or a misstep would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—“to reflect light into dark corners”—drives her micro‑choices (descending, surrendering the tooth), and her gardener pragmatism reads consistently. Internal contradiction is light; curiosity vs. caution is implied but never stressed into a true dilemma. The tactile handling of the tooth under pressure helps reveal her. The emotional cost (opening herself and relinquishing the object) lands but remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s drive is clear and consistent—she seeks to turn isolation into independence and answer the hum—but internal contradiction is light, with little on‑page friction beyond resolve. Micro‑choices (leaving the precipice, using the sundial, touching the orb) align with motive but rarely test it. The “brittle awakenings” memory reframes her stance but functions more as validation than conflict. The renunciation of reclusion at the end reads as change, though the cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to touch the connective “thread”—is clear and consistent, and leaving the talisman registers as a small but felt cost. Interiority is textured (noticing dragonfly, arches) and mostly embodied, though the realization reads slightly tidy. Minimal contradictory impulse on the page limits depth of conflict. The profession informs her perception but rarely pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to understand and outmaneuver the signal) is clear and drives concrete choices (calibrating a counter-frequency rather than blocking). Interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular, though internal contradiction is minimal and some traits are told rather than dramatized. The Hank exchange provides modest status pressure without deepening her flaw set. The closing endurance choice (vigilance with cost) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑specific motivation (find the key, legacy of her father) combines with a credible internal contradiction (claustrophobia vs. drive). Embodied beats—squeezing the passage, chamber contracting—show struggle under pressure. The final shift (embracing mutiny to reconfigure space) reads earned by prior fear management. Minor softness: a tidy self‑narration of “liberation” edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific (face blindness reframing threat as intent; the blacksmith’s lancing tool as heirloom/weapon), and her fear vs. resolve contradiction plays in the fog encounter. Her methodical nature is dramatized by retreat, arming, and choosing to sketch rather than chase. The final renunciation (leaving unsolved) reads earned by character logic. Some theme-forward declarations (“bridging gaps,” “unification of opposites”) flirt with telling.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to honor and reclaim her great‑uncle’s legacy) is clear and drives concrete choices from decoding to the ritual. Interiority is specific (“spongey dread,” practical handling of journals and the nail), and contradiction (skepticism vs. resolve) shows under pressure. The final choice feels emotionally earned but the cost is under-specified, softening the transformation’s bite. Brief on‑page reunion offers a relational crucible but doesn’t fully test her values.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Bridge-Song’s motive is clear and consistent, and their actions align with it, but internal contradiction is minimal; they encounter little friction or doubt. The “dynamically observant” trait is shown through specific noticing, not merely labeled. Emotional embodiment skews abstract (“luminous disbelief,” “sculpt possibility”) over concrete felt cost. The final choice to play reads as earned but relatively low-stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motive (to understand why paths circle back) is clear and consistent, and his calm, observational temperament informs his choices (methodical search, measured confrontation). However, internal contradiction is faint; he rarely feels pulled in opposing directions, which softens the on‑page cost. The brief status dynamic with the partner shows composure under pressure but doesn’t substantially transform him. The final acceptance reads earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and drive are clear, and her tactile actions (adjusting the lens, scribbling notes) track with her intent. However, interiority leans abstract (“heal with words,” “bridge between worlds”) with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift—accepting her own need for healing—lands but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt. Stronger embodied conflict or a pressured trade-off would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eira’s guardedness versus her compulsion to face what mirrors won’t show reads clearly, and her micro‑choices (stepping into the vortex, “unbending,” admitting “I failed”) align with that drive. Embodied sensations (cold air, currents pulling at her cloak) keep emotions grounded. The inner contradiction lands at the core beat when the confession activates the seed. Slight abstraction in labels (“warlike serenity”) dilutes some texture of her flaw and its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive (mend the eclipsed covenant, “find the intersection of dreams”) is clear and consistent, and her agency carries the scene. Internal contradiction is thin—she feels “anxious elation” but seldom faces a values conflict or cost that complicates her choice. Micro-choices are limited to entering, persisting, and placing the clipping, with little pressure to reveal deeper flaws. The scars function symbolically but don’t extract new on‑page cost that would sharpen character.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and contradiction (reckless idealist with fiercely gentle hands; prisoner/protector) are clear and embodied through action. Her micro‑choices (planting, following the warning, confronting the shadow self) align with values. The final endurance choice (to stay) is earned but comes a touch easily, with limited felt deterioration under peak pressure. A stronger sense of internal slippage or competing impulse at the peak would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (dust, diesel, the cloth’s frayed edge) with a credible contradiction between fact‑armor and ache. His micro‑choices (pressing the cloth to glass, pocketing it) align with a shift in motive. The “confidently uncertain” label threads his flaw into action. The epiphany lands slightly neat, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliara’s motives and contradictions are clear—methodical caution vs. yearning for answers—and her choice to plant the seed reads as a credible turn. Interiority is specific enough to feel embodied (trembling hands, the arbor’s hum), though moments veer toward tidy epiphany. The “haunted ambitions” are more declared than dramatized under pressure. The final peace lands but the on‑page cost of that shift is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and embodied through tool use and methodical labor, but internal friction is minimal. She solves the crisis with little visible struggle, and the acceptance at the end lacks a felt personal cost beyond reframing. Moments of reflection (“truth was not singular…”) verge on generalized, softening specificity of interior conflict. Still, her micro‑choices (orb, incantation, decoding runes) align with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s curiosity versus her professional duty is present but lightly pressured, with minimal on‑page cost to her deviation. Her interiority is mostly lyrical abstraction rather than contradictory impulses under stress. The choice to become a “bridge” lands, but feels relatively unresisted and swiftly affirmed. Embodied moments (pearl warmth, tactile handling) help, yet the epiphany arrives a touch too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—mapping toward self-forgiveness after stopping medication—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (entering the station, tracing maps, sounding a single note). The internal contradiction (recklessness vs. precision) is dramatized through her taped bellows and cataloged memories. The brief exchange with the man reframes her aim without erasing cost. A hair of therapy-tinged phrasing (“the clarity it brought was unforgiving”) trims the top end but doesn’t derail credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear motive (seek truth via the library) and embodied affect (“cautious exuberance,” the watch’s warmth) create a credible POV. Choices—entering, following the hum, writing, leaving—track with her aims. Internal conflict is mild; fear vs. hope is stated more than dramatized under pressure. The closing acceptance of the conduit role reads earned but carries limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—“to weigh a dream against an empire”—and her micro-choices (trusting coffee stains, moving to the balcony, bowing the violin) track cleanly under pressure. The interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (plant murmurs, “mulberry ache”), not generic. Internal contradiction (initial skepticism of divination vs. reliance on it) gives a credible shove into action. The visible cost (violin rendered “opaque and lifeless”) earns the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and trade—tender hands, mortuary beauty—anchor her choices, and the renunciation at the end reads as earned. The internal conflict (spark-seeking vs. fear/embrace of stillness) surfaces credibly. However, the realization comes quickly after the traveler’s thesis-like line, making the turn feel slightly tidy. More embodied cost in the pivot would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motive—seeking contentment after betrayal—is clear and consistently drives choices (following the map, touching the shell, entering the lake). Interiority is present but tends toward thematic summary over contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision to enter the lake lands but with little depicted struggle, making the transformation feel somewhat tidy. Still, actions align with motive and reveal a coherent, specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s motive and method are clear and consistent, but he faces little on‑page resistance and shows limited contradictory impulse. Interiority leans abstract (“welcome nuance into certainty”), with few embodied tells under pressure. The off‑page client removes relationship pressure that could force sharper micro‑choices. The final act (writing/sealing the letter) reads competent rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradiction—fear of chaos vs. duty to reveal—drives clear, on‑page choices culminating in her confession. Interiority is specific (stones, ripples, carved symbols) and aligned to motive, though a few lines lapse into abstraction. Her endurance of years of withholding credibly informs the choice. The cost is felt but remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motive and vocation are clear and consistent, but internal contradiction is minimal; they read as serenely competent rather than pressured into difficult micro-choices. Embodied perception (hands, arrowhead) works, yet emotions skew declared over conflicted. The final renunciation toward stillness is credible but carries little visible cost. A second, sharper tug-of-war within Kael would deepen character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is clear and coherent—Eli’s refusal to automate grounds his goal—but interior contradiction is light, with little friction beyond generic self‑doubt. His key micro‑choice (using the harness to attempt mist walking) aligns with his values but demands minimal personal cost. Emotional texture leans on summary rather than embodied specificity. The closing realization reads earned enough, but the inner conflict never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s draw toward the glowing hatch and his vow are clear and consistent, with tactile anchors (the warming key tag) that align action and motive. However, internal contradiction is light and largely summarized as a “longing he couldn’t name,” leaving little felt struggle. The epiphany reads more bestowed than wrestled for, which tempers depth.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the coins grounds her interiority, but internal conflict is faint—doubt yields to determination without a real on‑page struggle. The “cast lots” history colors her role yet functions more as label than crucible. Micro‑choices (adjusting dials, initiating distillation, submerging coins) align with her stated goals. The change at the end feels more affirmed than earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—naming the nameless to reconstitute purpose—and her micro‑choices (placing the page, invoking the ritual, naming each creature) align cleanly with that drive. The grief is felt through tactile details (cold marble, dulled scythe) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but modest; she is torn between renunciation and renewed duty, but pressure never forces a risky trade. The final shift back toward the scythe reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eliard’s earnest naiveté and devotion motivate every choice, and his careful, embodied actions (cleaning, alloying, hanging the bell) align with his internal hope and doubt. Internal conflict is present but gentle—he wonders if his efforts are enough without a sharp contradictory impulse. The cost is modest but legible in the scarred bell and the patience required. Strong single‑POV interiority; could push deeper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—restore the town’s memory through gentle action—and his choices align with his “precisely humane” nature. However, there’s little internal contradiction or cost under pressure; he encounters no real resistance, and his emotions don’t fray. The result is credible but low‑friction characterization. The final stance feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (harmonize logic and intuition), and a small, credible hesitation at the altar shows a live internal tension. However, interiority leans on summary (“secretly sentimental”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her choice to place the crystal reads consistent but low‑friction, with limited cost or blind‑spot exposure. The emotional shift at the end is earned but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Motivation (restore order/preserve trust) is clear, but interior contradiction remains abstract and under-pressured. The tension between “inventive nature” and “watcher’s burden” is told rather than dramatized in a concrete choice. Micro-choices (pausing, revising, adjusting gear) lack visible cost or embodied struggle. The figure reads as an archetype more than a singular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation—to end numbness by confronting the “Duplicate”—is clear and sustained, with credible fear/acceptance tension during the duel. Interiority leans abstract (“emotional numbness,” “vivify”) rather than textured, character‑particular sensation. The contradictory impulses surface but don’t cut deep enough to feel singular. The final choice (shattering the jar) aligns with the established drive and carries a plausible inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s curiosity and protectiveness are clear and consistent, and his choices (planting the seed, studying the key, dropping it into the brook) align with those traits. However, internal conflict is mild; fears of “gift/test/sinister” don’t generate hard trade-offs or visible emotional cost. Interiority is competent but leans on generalized phrasing (“orthogonal approaches,” “his motivation clearer than ever”). The character endures little strain en route to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and felt—restore lost laughter—with embodied anchors (the warmed pull cord, chest heaving). The internal tension “impossible yet mournfully eager” is present but not deeply complicated beyond endurance. Micro‑choices (singing, pulling, refusing to stop) align with the goal and accrue cost. Character particularity is strong but remains more emblem than contradiction-rich psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s opposing drives—feral duty to the library vs. dimensional homesickness—are embodied in micro‑choices (pausing, “interiorizing exteriors,” tightening on the pendant) and culminate in a credible renunciation. Dialogue with the keeper clarifies status and pressure without flattening her interiority. A few abstractions (“make friends with uncertainty”) lean told rather than dramatized, but the final choice feels earned. The visible cost—enduring homesickness—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and interiority are clear and consistent, with a credible shift from resurrecting the dead to awakening the dormant. The crozier-focused micro-choices under pressure (kneeling, cleaning symbols, deciding to press it into the ground) reveal character. Some emotion is summarized in abstract terms (“stoically sensitive,” “stifling destiny”), softening the edge of contradiction. The final renunciation (letting go of resurrection) is earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    Motivation is clear (tune the shard; “find the beginning in every ending”), and micro-choices on the console track that aim. However, interior conflict is minimal—competence dominates and contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page. The reversal (misassumption about finite power) is a good character-revealing beat but lands without much embodied cost. Emotional texture leans abstract, reducing individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation drives every choice, and a few tactile cues (cold hourglass, erratic watch) anchor her resolve. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers, even when warned—so pressure reveals little new about her. The transient’s warning could have forced a micro‑hesitation; instead it glances off. The earned cost (“forever changed”) lands but remains abstract emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—“to discover the texture of connection”—is clear and drives her choice to resume weaving after the shadow-man’s warning. Fear versus drive is dramatized in-scene, not summarized, and the fleeting touch provides embodied cost. Interiority is concrete (childhood recall, mother’s whisper) and tied to present stakes. Slight abstraction at the end (“worth every risk”) smooths complexity but doesn’t undercut the earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—defend star‑navigation by synthesizing it with alien knowledge—but her inner contradiction remains soft. The brief exchange with Kael gives status texture and shows resolve under pressure. Her decision to “show them” and orchestrate a ritual are credible micro‑choices. Costs and blind spots are muted, keeping the arc more steady than climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive and profession are clear, and her embodied responses (trembling fingers, breath catching) anchor a credible inner life. However, internal contradiction is minimal—curiosity meets almost no counter‑impulse—so micro‑choices under pressure feel light. Her commitment to “protect her story” reads as an extension of pre‑stated values rather than a pressured turn. The character is vivid but not stress‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s fear-versus-duty engine is clear and embodied (tightening headlamp grip, breath ragged) and her micro-choices under pressure (prying the vault, touching the codex) feel motivated. The debt to Dr. Voss personalizes the quest and sustains her through the squeeze. The final endurance—fear loosened but not erased—reads earned, though the resolution edges slightly tidy. A sharper on-page cost beyond interior strain would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal is clear and drives action, with tactile interiority (counting heartbeats, tracing the shard) anchoring her motives. Micro-choices under pressure—leaning into the ink patterns, committing to the defragmentation—track with her identity stakes. Internal contradiction is present but mild; she’s mostly determined rather than torn. The final acceptance feels earned, though the cost is largely emotional and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and carried through—she enters to save a dying language and endures cost to do so. Interiority is present (“hands trembled,” “pressed on while draining”) but contradictions remain soft; we seldom see competing impulses clash in-scene beyond endurance. Actions align with motives and the choice to continue as the diamond drains feels earned. A deeper, messier inner debate would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent (seeking the arrowhead to redeem grief), with embodied beats like the digging and the final laugh. Internal conflict (bitterness vs. curiosity/hope) registers, though it’s sometimes told rather than dramatized. The laughter as renunciation feels earned by prior setup but the on‑page cost is modest. Specific micro‑choices (answering the call, entering the alcove, choosing laughter) track.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (sustain and restore the orchard through music) is clear and her key choice—using the locust shell to sync her heartbeat—tracks with established traits. Interiority is vivid if conventional at times; contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are present but lightly sketched. The final endurance choice feels earned, though the on‑page cost is modest (precarious bridge, spent shell). A deeper flaw or hesitation under peak pressure would add dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (his sister’s plea; “fix what’s broken”) drives tactics, and fear/hope contradictions surface in the bottle’s pull and the chase. Interiority is mostly embodied through tools and place rather than therapy-speak. The success feels a touch smooth, with limited on-page price paid beyond risk. Still, actions and micro-choices align well with the ethos of “respectfully rebellious.”

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motive—reading silence as possibility—is clear and embodied in tactile actions (handling wood, pocketing the fragment, following the bells). The internal contradiction (a “silent” man who must sing) is compelling but under-explored emotionally at the peak. His decisive act (singing) aligns with established traits yet lacks visible cost tied to his past. A richer sense of what it costs him to break silence would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive (“reawaken something lost”) is clear and her micro‑choices (spiral, fractal, Möbius) align with her odd rigor. Interiority is particular enough (sensory cues, tactile tracing of diagrams) but internal conflict is light—she rarely doubts or wavers. The cost at the end (accepting guardianship/solitude) lands, though it could be more sharply dramatized in her body. Overall, credible, single‑POV characterization with limited contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to reclaim/translate a “runaway dream” through art) is clear and steady, and her choices—venturing out, pressing the shutter, then painting—align. Interiority is vivid but largely unilateral longing; contradictory impulses under pressure are mild, yielding a relatively tidy realization. Embodied emotion lands via tactile details (damp sand, salt breeze), though struggle feels low‑friction. The closing renunciation (“not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew”) is earned but light on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive (freeing the idea despite fear) is clear and rooted in her history with her mother, and the lock of hair provides a concrete emotional conduit. Interiority is present but safe; contradictory impulses surface (“tremor in her heart” vs steady hands) yet never force a difficult on‑page trade‑off. Competence edges out struggle as the vault yields after one phrase, muting pressure‑driven micro‑choices. The ending shows resolve, but cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and professional lens are clear and embodied—she notices, tests, and digs because she’s a hands‑on folklorist. However, internal contradiction is light: curiosity rarely collides with fear or doubt on the page. The trembling at the dig hints at pressure but no real moral trade‑off is forced. The final stance (charged readiness) feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—quiet mentorship through annotating a trapped shadow—is clear and character‑specific, with embodied quirks (backwards walking, trembling hands). Contradictory impulses (nervousness vs. resolve; fragility vs. “combative tenderness”) are present but rarely force a hard trade‑off. Micro‑choices (brewing oolong, tracing leaves, annotating) reveal her values. The cost of her stance remains subtle, limiting peak depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motive—preserving wonder—is clear and consistent, and her choice to plant the seed aligns with it. However, there’s little on‑page contradiction or cost testing her resolve; she meets no resistance. Interiority is lyrical but generalized, with few character‑particular flaws under pressure. The result reads steady and competent rather than pressured or revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (grounding spirits while carrying her own grief) is clear and embodied through tactile choices (pressing the needle, pleading at the stubborn knot). The internal tension between craft competence and emotional fragility lands, especially when she hesitates and asks for strength. However, the realization about “honoring their stories” is stated rather than discovered through action, softening the felt contradiction. The cost shows as exhaustion and trembling, credibly earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive and temperament (“interpret silence with empathy,” “shielded openness”) are clear and consistent, and her choices (comparing footage, deciding to dig) align. Interiority leans abstract and declarative, with little on-page contradiction or frayed psychology under pressure. The endurance cost is gestured at (“hours turned into days”) but not felt in the body. Strong competence is shown without much genuine struggle or moral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent; her curiosity and analytic habit drive her to follow the map and interpret the letter. Interiority is concrete and tied to objects (journal, globe), avoiding label-only feeling. The internal conflict (hollow triumph vs. pursuit of meaning) is present but under-pressured. The final renunciation is credible, though the cost reads conceptual more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to free and articulate the ghost—is clear and consistent, and her agency drives the ritual. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; she rarely hesitates or pays an acute personal price beyond letting go. Embodied emotion surfaces in tactile actions (tuning, placing the plate, singing) more than in contradictory impulses. The kinship with the ghost is evocative but could sharpen through a harder trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (lingering in the library, searching compartments) track with a warmly inquisitive nature. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely faces a live trade‑off beyond mild time pressure. The epiphany reads tidy, with limited felt cost. The mentor bond adds dimension but is mostly retrospective rather than pressuring her in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drive and professional lens are clear and particular, and her leap reads as aligned with a consistent, fervent curiosity. Interiority is concrete (clouds by emotion), though internal conflict is light—she scarcely hesitates before “knew what she had to do.” The guardian self‑anointing edges toward tidy, softening cost. Embodied moments (hand on telescope, railing balance) help, but ambiguity at the peak is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—testing whether she can “mirror the sky inside walls”—is clear and aligned with her craft and perceptual signature. Interiority is textured (unsettling yet comforting stillness; obsession-driven focus), though internal contradiction doesn’t significantly complicate choices. The face-blindness is thematically resonant but under-leveraged in action. She earns a subtle shift at the end, but the cost to her is mostly implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and perseverance are clear and motivate each action; her micro‑choices (deciphering, following the beam, opening the hatch) align with stated traits. Interiority is present but largely linear—little contradictory impulse under pressure beyond “sociable isolation.” Emotional embodiment is decent (trembling hands, breath catching) but avoids deeper ambivalence or risk. The final stance change (from isolation to purposeful command) lands, though the cost is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal and method are clear, and her embodied reactions (trembling, heart pounding) track with her pressures. However, contradictory impulses are faint; she rarely wavers between competing values in a way that changes tactics. The realization about “interconnectedness” reads earned but low-cost. Micro-choices exist (deciphering, entering, taking the gears), yet none exposes a deep flaw or moral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivations are clear (Elara’s altruism; Kael’s restlessness) but interiority and contradiction are thin, with little on‑page struggle or micro‑choices under pressure. The ensemble acts competently with minimal friction; no relationship is tested. Elara’s fade provides a modest cost but not a character‑driven reckoning. Stronger embodiment of doubt or conflict would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive and contradictions are clear: doubt and fear versus duty and tenderness, embodied in the blood on the shard and the faltering lullaby. Micro‑choices (spiraling fragments, pressing until she bleeds, recommitting after the beam stutters) reveal values under pressure. Interiority stays character‑particular and sensorial rather than diagnostic. The mentor’s aphorism edges toward thematic statement but is earned by the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are clear (resentful caretaker driven by duty and hope), and her choices under pressure (assembling the map, rescuing the traveler, planting the nut) track cleanly. Interiority is specific enough to feel embodied, though her contradictions could bite harder on the page. The traveler is a prop rather than a crucible, limiting relational pressure. The final stance shift (duty to chosen purpose) lands, with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s grief, professional mindset, and longing to “atone” cohere into a credible inner drive, with tactile anchors (foam, chrysalis) grounding her interiority. The epiphany is a touch neat, but it grows from observed phenomena and her polymer lens rather than from generic assertion. Contradictory impulses (retreat into work vs. desire to reconnect) are present though managed calmly rather than contested under sharper pressure. The closing commitment feels earned, if gently priced.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s goal and professional method are clear and drive action, with embodied beats (steady hand, quickened heart) that fit her competence. However, interior contradiction is light; she proceeds with near‑certainty and minimal doubt or competing impulses. The final choice (spending the moonlight) is motivated but carries limited felt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to smooth the cutting edges of memory) is clear and drives her choices, and her gift is consistently dramatized through tactile tasting and subsuming. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely falters or miscalculates, so the struggle feels controlled rather than contested. The brief overwhelm at the shard is strong but passes quickly. The final lightness lands, but the cost reads modest.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied in small actions (placing the weight, breath before singing), but her interior conflict is minimal—she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond tears. The “empathetically decisive” label is enacted but not tested by counter-pressure. Mr. Kovar’s entrance adds texture yet doesn’t pressure Elara directly. Change is credible but emotionally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive and paradoxical temperament are clear and consistent, and her choice to become a “keeper of memories” feels organically earned. Interiority is particular enough (fingers on shards, risk to her mind) though occasionally told via labels like “chaotically precise.” The resolution is credible but low‑cost; the risk is asserted rather than tested. Still, her final vow coheres with prior beats and reveals values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and her small, concrete choices (stepping into the pool, catching the manuscript, aligning the doodle) align with it. However, internal conflict is minimal; her “latent blaze” reads as a flat descriptor rather than a contradictory pressure under stress. Emotional texture skews generalized (“mix of fear and excitement”). The final acceptance of “responsibility” feels asserted more than earned through costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—“to create music in a silent world”—is clear and consistently embodied in her craft. Interiority is particular (reading stress cracks like sheet music), but there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. Her micro‑choices (when to begin, how to handle the insulator, how to “strum”) align with motive yet face minimal pressure. The final trembling and dawn finish register a modest cost but not a tested renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Alara’s motive—reframing silence and reclaiming purpose—is clear and coherently tied to her exile and chess method. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (worry stone, board) and the knight’s symbolism. The turn to return home is earned, though the internal conflict resolves a bit neatly without visible friction at the point of choice. Some lines edge toward declared insight over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation and interior lens are clear and consistent, with tactile attention to sound and the clasp. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance and faces no difficult trade‑off. The “eclectic pacifist” label doesn’t bear on choices. The ending acceptance reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s ambition and hypersensitive nose create a coherent, character‑particular interiority, and her small choices (planting, collecting tide‑rain, journaling, inhaling) align with motive. The internal conflict (drive vs. emptiness) is clear, though the epiphany leans stated rather than struggled for. Embodied emotion appears in tactile gardening and scent reception. The cost—loosening her hold on ambition—is felt but gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are thin; she rarely wavers or pays for choices. Her micro‑choices (anchoring, following the river, inserting the tip) align with motive yet face little friction. Emotional language tends toward generic (“she knew she was close,” “her heart raced”) rather than character‑particular texture. The ending grants purpose without dramatizing what it costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear, with tactile attention to objects (the patch) revealing her values under pressure. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely faces a micro‑choice that costs her something beyond resolve. Emotional texture skews declarative (“Her foresight had been right”) rather than embodied conflict. The endurance/mission stance at the end reads earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, with synesthesia shaping perception and choices. However, internal conflict stays low-friction—she “unfetter[s] her own fears” without a concrete, pressured trade‑off. Micro‑choices (timing the ringing, raising the sheet) align with motive but never force a painful sacrifice. The final emotional turn reads earned but comfortable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained (atonement through understanding), and the hesitation before playing the flute gives a credible internal conflict. Interiority is competent but leans on familiar beats (“trembled,” “heart pounding”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. Her choice to play despite fear feels earned by the backstory. The cost is mostly conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (decoding “the mathematics of emotion”) is clear and consistent, and his contradictory impulses—yearning for connection vs. fear of self‑loss—surface when the empathy flood overwhelms him. Embodied beats (“ragged gasps,” trembling fingers) keep it grounded. The final reorientation (empathy expands boundaries) feels earned by the on‑page ordeal. A slight tilt toward abstract phrasing in key realizations keeps it shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s jitteriness, grief for Alaric, and incremental courage read convincingly, with embodied beats (the hum syncing to breath, her hesitation at the door). The handoff moment and her reluctant touch show micro‑choices under pressure. Internal contradiction (fear vs. wonder/purpose) is present but not deeply stress‑tested. The final acceptance feels earned, though the visible cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to prove her theory) is clear and drives concrete actions (the communion, handling the prism). The grief revelation triggers a credible internal duality—“the truth of the prism’s sorrow and the lie of its beauty”—and she recalibrates with felt humility. Interiority is specific and embodied (breath, chill, trembling hands) rather than labeled. The cost is modest but present: she carries the sorrow and yields her triumphal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s agency is clear—she chooses to leave, follows the puzzle, places the final piece, and steps onto the bridge—anchored by a credible, consistent desire to “carry a message across impossible distance.” The sacrifice of home is felt, but internal contradiction remains understated; her hesitations and competing impulses are more implied than dramatized. Embodied emotion surfaces via tactile motifs (calloused fingers, bead warmth) rather than stock labels, which works. A sharper beat where she nearly turns back would deepen the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Eli’s choice to barter his “awakening” for his people grounds the arc. The internal hesitation at the trade hints at contradiction but isn’t deeply dramatized beyond a brief pause. Much of the descent is summarized, limiting micro-choices under pressure. The change at the end is credible yet thematically phrased rather than embodied with specific costs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal (uncover a withheld truth) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (picking up the shard, combining shards) align with it. However, interior contradiction is minimal and she accepts revelations too smoothly, muting felt struggle. Embodied emotion appears (“weight on her shoulders”) but often yields to summary. The guide figure removes pressure that might have revealed more character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s reticence and observational bent are clearly dramatized, and his micro‑choices (feeling the glass, reading the stones, opening the compartment) align with his nature. The interior “luminescent ache” gives him texture without melodrama. However, his final conviction arrives a touch tidy, with limited on‑page ambivalence or visible cost. The shift reads earned but soft, more resolution than reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    The Herald’s motive (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and threads through their choices, and the panic-to-curiosity-to-exultation swing feels character‑specific. Interiority is mostly atmospheric rather than embodied; we get little concrete felt cost beyond “shadowed elation.” The accidental prophecy trait informs mindset but rarely pressures a tough internal trade‑off on the page. Still, the decisive choice to steer into the fog arises credibly from prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael reads as specific and embodied (dye‑stained hands, donor heart sensitivity), and his deliberate choice to approach the grieving woman aligns with his motive. Interiority is present but largely serene; contradictory impulses (gift vs. curse) skim the surface rather than driving a fraught on‑page trade‑off. The woman has texture but functions mostly as a catalyst. The ending stance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV interiority is clear and consistent—Elias’s curiosity and craft drive his actions—but contradictory impulses and tangible cost are minimal. His competence faces little friction, so change arrives more as a calm recognition than a hard-won shift. The choice to deconstruct the sextant aligns with motive but never strains him. This limits depth even as the character feels specific.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal (rekindle the realm) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the memory‑scatter trait provides credible internal resistance. Interiority is present but skews generalized (“her motivation burned brighter”) rather than sharply character‑particular. The shift from searching for “words” to accepting a felt lullaby is a credible micro‑turn but lacks a palpable sacrifice. The ending change reads earned, though the cost stays mostly emotional and light.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s desire to uncover the conclave and accept her contradictions is clear and consistent, but the interior struggle is mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. Her final renunciation (“hide no more”) is earned but low-cost on the page. Embodiment is light—more dust and candles than felt, contradictory impulses colliding in scene. Thaddeus functions as a gentle nudge rather than a crucible forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive (to find the sacred in the ordinary) is clear and coherently expressed through her actions, especially the gentle gardening and response to the bread. However, internal contradiction and pressure are limited; she rarely faces a competing impulse or palpable cost. Micro‑choices exist (where to plant, whether to pursue the bread’s meaning) but none are hard. The final stance (quiet peace) is credible but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and professional temperament are vivid, and her “gently meticulous” nature credibly collides with newfound urgency. Interiority is concrete (gloves, breath, device), but the emotional cost remains soft. The turn from archivist to conduit reads earned yet low‑friction. Greater on‑page struggle or a price for choosing urgency would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lila’s motive is clear and consistent, and her practiced reading of silences fits the world. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely struggles or errs on the page. The “reluctant guardian” note at the end gestures at cost without dramatizing it. Secondary characters apply light, generic pressure rather than forcing a sharper personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s paradox—skepticism versus luminous attunement—reads cleanly on the page and motivates the micro‑choices (following the taste shifts, approaching the figure). Interiority is grounded in sensory detail (metallic vs. sweet) rather than labels. The final acceptance is credible but carries little visible cost beyond “turmoil.” Lack of friction or mistake under pressure limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s fear-versus-calling tension is embodied (charcoal-stained fingers, trembling hand) and culminates in a credible commitment to risk a new self. The note “You were meant for more than this” skews a touch on‑the‑nose, softening complexity at the pivot. Still, her micro‑choices (handling the lock, approaching the glimmer, turning to paint herself) reveal values under pressure. The change forecloses her safe, mechanical path with an implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to locate “where lost conversations went” to restore Verdania and herself) is clear and consistent, filtered through her craft and its truth‑bound constraint. Interiority is specific—her trembling hands, the leaves’ reaction—though internal contradiction is modest (she hesitates when the words turn dishonest, then presses on). Her actions align with motive and culminate in an earned choice to inscribe despite the bitter revelation. The visible cost is chiefly emotional and ethical rather than relational, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the “color of wonder”—is clear and drives her choices (carving, tuning, setting the sculpture in motion). However, interior conflict is minimal; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a real cost push back against her goal. The seasonally mute trait is evocative but does not constrain a choice on the page. The faint smile at the end reads earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (protect the farm/quiet the static) is clear and her contradiction—caretaker vs. cared‑for, nostalgic vs. utilitarian—surfaces in the choice to open the box. The costed change (memories muted) credibly reconfigures her identity. However, the struggle is often summarized (“the process was brutal”) rather than embodied through specific, character‑particular sensations or missteps. A few abstract labels (“fragmented wholeness”) flatten otherwise strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s curiosity and vocation motivate clear, coherent choices (approach, consult, unlock, read). Interiority is present but safe; contradictory impulses (risk vs. reverence) are only lightly felt, so pressure on her “listening” ethos is minimal. Mrs. Ellis provides a gentle relational crucible without true friction. The final reorientation to “purpose” is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her choices (reading the journal through dance) align with her goal. However, there’s little internal contradiction or felt cost; “calm defiance” faces minimal on‑page resistance. The piece avoids therapy‑speak but also avoids pressure that would expose deeper fault lines. The final stance feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and specific—recover lost memories—rooted in a credible professional identity (lantern lighter seeking clarity). Interiority is present but tidy; there’s little genuine contradiction or cost under pressure. Micro-choices (lighting lanterns, reciting patterns, stepping through) align but don’t expose a hierarchy of values under strain. The ending shifts understanding but sidesteps a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear, and her embodied focus (breath aligning to the brook, the wing humming) grounds her interiority. However, she faces little credible inner contradiction—determination predominates without a counter‑impulse beyond generic fear of failure. Micro‑choices exist (mapping silence, cocooning the prophecy), but no value tradeoff tests her. The final vigilance note adds cost but doesn’t arise from a conflicted internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s curiosity and guardedness are clear, with the seal as a personalized tell and a credible micro‑choice arc from caution to commitment. Interiority is present but not deeply embodied; emotional texture leans conceptual over visceral. Elias’s distinct voice and status (guide/mystic) sharpen dynamics without overpowering Clara’s POV. The final decision (knocking with sugar) feels motivated by prior beats, though the cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s skepticism versus curiosity is embodied through tactile choices (touching the orchid, lifting the shell) and a credible interior tug-of-war. Her turn from resistance to acceptance reads earned by escalating sensory pressure. The cost is softer—she assumes the role of archivist without a sharp personal loss—but the orchid’s dimming suggests a price. Dialogue tilts thematic and slightly generic, which blunts individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (release from inherited pain) is clear and enacted through a concrete, risky choice: erasing her father’s letter. The hesitation at the thorn to parchment is a credible pressure point showing contradictory impulses. Cost registers in the loss of the document and surrender of bitterness, though the struggle resolves a touch neatly. Interiority remains specific to her craft and history rather than generic grief.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, and her actions (entering the archway, choosing to look into the pool) align with it. Interiority is textured but leans abstract; contradictory impulses are muted, with little friction beyond “hesitant but resolute.” The emotional shift from melancholy to resolve reads, but the visible cost is light. The “richly perceptive” trait mostly states rather than complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to give voice to the lost—feels clear and drives her choices (placing the globe, parsing dreams, whispering names). Interiority is tangible and embodied in the shrine’s ritual, though internal contradiction is slight and largely untested. The ghost‑whisperer competence is credible but rarely strained. The ending’s quiet renunciation (leaving the globe) reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to honor hidden effort—is clear and consistently embodied through her handling of the whisk and attention to fireflies. Interiority is specific and sensorial, but contradictory impulses are faint; her small startle at the whistle’s echo is the closest to live tension. The final shift (accepting an inner alignment with the patterns she seeks) lands but with minimal visible cost. The net‑mender detail colors perception yet never forces a test or trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (“excavate truth, no matter the cost”) is clear and drives choices from inquiry to containment. Her skepticism vs. dawning belief produces credible micro-turns (marker not curse → prison warning). Interiority is serviceable but leans on summary and label (e.g., “sharply observant”) rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure. The final renunciation/endurance (contain, accept vigilance) reads earned with a modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and worldview are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (tuning the radio, deciding to activate the portico) align with them. Internal conflict is present but lightly sketched; the “variant allegiance” dilemma doesn’t bite hard enough on the page. Emotions skew summarized (“His motivation was clear”), softening embodied specificity. The bittersweet final acceptance lands but with limited visible cost in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific: he gathers sounds to redeem lost voices and tests that belief against resistance. Embodied beats (tracing carvings, whispering “Speak to me,” holding a shard to his ear) reveal character under pressure. A modest contradiction—tender devotion versus impatience with the jammed gears—adds texture. The final acceptance of his role, paid for by the shattered jar, reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (guardianship) and internal tension (logic vs. heart) are clear and drive her choices, especially in the “Prove it” beat. Embodied detail—hand to pocket, boots on stone—grounds her. However, the “logically emotional” framing reads labeled rather than revealed at times, blunting complexity. The final stance feels earned but the cost to her psyche or situation is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains mostly declarative and serene, with little on‑page contradiction or pressure testing the “impatience” she seeks to sculpt. The choice atop the viaduct reads as an earned renunciation, yet we don’t feel a concrete cost beyond summary reframing. Micro‑choices exist (mapping, studying, sharing insights) but occur in low resistance. The absence of a relational crucible limits dynamic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motives (solve the collapse, break from a controlling mentor) are clear and her calm, methodical choices reveal character under pressure. Interiority is specific in places (empirical noticing; tactile use of the lantern) but the internal conflict with the mentor is mostly told rather than dramatized. Competence dominates with little visible struggle or cost in-scene, softening the arc’s bite. The final renunciation lands but feels low‑risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (guilt and doubt converting to resolve) is clear and consistent, with a credible internal tug between skepticism and belief. His micro-choices (bringing the heart, staying to watch, accepting the implicit rebuke) reveal hierarchy of values. Alistair applies gentle but pointed pressure that sharpens Elias’s stance. A slight reliance on aphoristic insight (“Mending isn’t just…”), rather than embodied contradiction under stress, keeps this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motive is clear and persistent, and her embodied grind (calloused hands, bloodshot eyes) gives credible drive. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely weighs competing impulses under pressure. The arrow‑tip backstory adds texture but doesn’t force a present‑tense value trade. The final stance (ringing the bell) is earned but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elara’s drive to find where deleted files go feeds every action. Interiority skews functional rather than singular, leaning on familiar cues (“heart raced,” “mind racing”) with limited contradictory impulses. The lie adds a flicker of moral tension but isn’t fully mined for cost. Still, actions align with motive and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive (“to map empathy onto action”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (entering the mirror shop, testing each mirror, placing the fragment) align with it. Internal conflict is present but muted; she faces fears largely in summary, with little on‑page contradiction or cost. The merger of her “shadow‑laced” nature with the “courage of the anomaly” lands, but feels earned more by assertion than dramatized struggle. Strong presence, low frictions, modest depth.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—witnessing others’ endings to understand her own relationship to impermanence—is specific and consistent, and her “I’m here to help” despite doubt gives her a live contradiction. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (parasol, frost, breath) rather than labels. The man’s question meaningfully tests her desire, prompting a recalibration. The cost of her shift (relinquishing a voyeuristic distance for acceptance) is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is coherent and specific (practical vs. passionate; gently persuasive), with the burned letter mediating her conflict. However, most pressure is reflective rather than dramatized through tough micro‑choices. The final shift—embracing “the space between”—is credible but arrives a touch epiphanic. Embodied emotion appears (tracing charred edge, vineyard symmetry), but the cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the echo of wisdom before change—reads clean and consistent, and her ritual action aligns. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets no meaningful resistance and experiences little degradation under pressure. The “strangely honest” trait is mostly labeled rather than dramatized with cost. The final fulfillment lands, but with limited on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and specific—personal loss fuels Elara’s archival mission—and her calm, deliberate actions align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile work with photos and the map case, not abstract labels. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; she moves smoothly from intention to completion. The final stance shift is gentle rather than earned through a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s goal and temperament are clear, and his methods (humming, listening, noting) reveal a particular mind under pressure. The felt cost—allowing the crystal to drain as he decodes—lands as an earned endurance. However, internal contradiction is mild; he rarely wavers or confronts a concrete dilemma beyond steady patience. The arc closes credibly but without a sharp, character-testing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motivation (“to capture the sound of growing older”) drives tactile micro‑choices (chalk lines, reclaimed driftwood). The “precognitively forgetful” flaw usefully complicates his orientation and lends interior contradiction. Emotional embodiment is steady, if quiet, with no safety hedging. The cost and renunciation at the end (letting the chalk fall; accepting the hum) read, but remain understated.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile work and a “luminous ache.” Her epiphany via the leaf sound borders on ease, but it’s at least seeded and reprises at the end. Micro‑choices (observe, study, dismantle, reimagine, build) track with her competence. Internal conflict is mild; she rarely meets genuine resistance beyond insight and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (facilitate a final reconciliation) is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (the call to Claire, the harp). Interiority is serviceable but risk‑averse; we rarely see contradictory impulses or cost beyond generalized kindness. Claire and Mrs. Bennett function more as catalysts than pressure sources, keeping Elara’s struggle relatively untested. Still, actions align with traits and produce a credible, if gentle, earned endurance by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her cautious temperament informs her method. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she meets little internal friction beyond patience. Micro‑choices (returning to the workshop, etching runes, waiting at the edge) align with her traits but don’t expose deeper flaws. The ending reflects endurance more than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and guilt are clear and consistent, and her key micro‑choices (entering the maze, placing the tooth, sacrificing the stone) align with motive. The hesitation at the fountain provides a credible internal conflict, though the cost of surrendering “certainty” stays largely symbolic rather than viscerally felt. Some traits (“forgiving skeptic,” “shrewdly innocent”) are told more than dramatized. Still, the final renunciation reads earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation (share light without fire) with tactile interiority and a distinct craft ethos. Contradictory impulses are muted; serenity dominates and pressure rarely distorts thought or behavior. The mother’s maxim deepens character but the conflict remains low‑heat. The closing readiness reads earned yet lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (a protected space for healing after viral exposure) is clear and drives micro‑choices: she hesitates, shields with the pendant, then lets Kai in and curates what he sees. The contradiction—guarded yet seeking connection—reads on the page. The shift from solitary refuge to shared language is earned but remains gentle, with minimal abrasion or flaw complexity in the interaction. Kai’s pressure is soft, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s conflicting impulses—self‑protection versus duty to give voice—surface in scene (“part of her wanted to turn away…while another part yearned”). Concrete micro‑choices (following the path, accepting the woman’s story, placing the shell, beginning to write) align with her motive. Embodied emotion exists but leans abstract at times (“longing, despair” as whispers) and the resolution feels slightly tidy. Still, the internal turn reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. However, there’s little friction or contradictory impulse on the page—she rarely doubts, fails, or pays a cost. Interiority is pleasant but safe, with limited specificity under pressure. The final stance (teach the village) reads as resolve rather than a hard-earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her actions align with her goal. Interiority is present but leans abstract, with little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. The cost of using her long‑guarded starlight hints at depth but doesn’t force a fraught choice. Overall, credible but low‑pressure characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s want is clear and particular, and his competence is credibly shown through tactile work with gears and light. However, internal contradiction is light—he scarcely doubts or risks, so pressure on his motives remains mild. The micro-choices (observing dusk angles, deciding to reassemble) align with his trait set but rarely force trade-offs. The ending’s endurance stance lands, but the cost is mostly implied as time and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to bear and measure others’ burdens) is clear, with embodied tells like the tightening grip on the lamp. The encounter forces a credible internal contradiction—duty vs self-preservation—into speech and action. Her final choice to turn the weaving inward reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains more implied than felt. Dialogue reveals status shifts without flattening her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting grief into craft—is clear and specific, and her micro‑choices (tea, tool selection, tackling the mane) embody it. The internal contradiction (contain the “here and gone”) lives in action rather than summary. A quiet but credible shift to resilience lands. A touch of thematic self‑naming risks mild neatness but doesn’t undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (to negotiate with her own ghost) is clear and her collecting habit yields concrete micro‑choices. Embodied beats—mud, the wheel to her ear—ground her interiority. The internal conflict (regret vs. persistence) is credible, though labels like “eroded ambitions” occasionally abstract the feeling. The final shift to seeing the ghost as guide is earned but a touch epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Eli’s motive—to “puzzle out new equations for hope”—is clear and consistent, and his experiments with vents, mirrors, and speakers align with his civil‑engineer lens. However, there’s little internal contradiction or cost; he solves problems smoothly without visible doubt or misstep. Emotional texture leans abstract (“stoic wonder”) over embodied specificity. The final choice to leave with the sextant registers but doesn’t confront a thorny trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her meticulous hands, the scent of petrichor, the voided clock face—and her choice to finish her father’s clock reads as a credible renunciation with cost. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. travel) operate simultaneously on the page, not in alternation. The resolution trends a touch tidy, softening the felt cost of foreclosed travel. Still, motivation and micro-choices under pressure are clear and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, and her embodied focus (the warmth/pulse of the sundial, ache on reading the confession) grounds motivation. However, internal conflict is minimal; her instincts never meet serious doubt or competing impulses. Actions align cleanly with motives but feel low-risk, muting complexity. The final stance is earned but costs her little beyond a moment of ache.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s vocation and motive are clear and consistent, and her tactile attention to the rope reveals character through action. Interiority is specific (breath in cold air, fingers tracing knots) but largely unconflicted—she faces little inner contradiction. Her patience and competence carry the scene but at low visible cost. The ending’s acceptance of stewardship feels earned yet emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The traveler’s motive—writing obituaries for the living—reads specific and drives her choices, while the elderly woman’s long waiting gives the scene a credible wound. Interiority is steady and embodied through sensory noticing rather than abstract labels. The traveler’s gift of the notebook and the woman’s tears register a cost, though the traveler’s internal contradiction and risk remain low. Relationship pressure is gentle rather than bracing, limiting peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s drive is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict—assembling a machine to revive what he idealizes as organic beauty—creates credible friction. His micro-choices (descending, assembling despite misgivings, accepting a non-forcing stance) align with motives. Some phrasing leans generic (“quaking with both fear and reverie,” “bitterly sweet truth”), softening the particularity of his interiority. Still, the final acceptance reads earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to transform what’s sterile and prove “scars can sing”—is clear, character‑rooted, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (kneeling, planting, binding seeds with the red thread). The firefighter/arsonist‑legacy tension supplies a credible internal contradiction (hardened by whispers yet compassionate in action). A touch of thematic declaration edges toward telling, but embodied choices keep it earned. The felt cost remains social and existential rather than immediate, but it’s persuasive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—skepticism tugging against wonder—tracks cleanly across beats, and her micro‑choices (pocketing the shard, continuing despite doubt, placing the final piece) align with that arc. The internal contradiction is present but soft; she rarely pays a visible price for belief. Embodied emotion shows in the syncing glow/heartbeat, though moments lean more lyrical than pressured. The closing shift to “liberator” lands but feels relatively low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her tactile engagement with the gear provides some embodied interiority. However, the emotional field skews abstract and serene, with little contradictory impulse or visible struggle under pressure. The “weight of purpose” is told more than dramatized. The final acceptance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—transforming collective grief into stone—drives concrete choices (studying the ribbon, altering the carving) with embodied focus. The internal contradiction (seeking a “shape” vs. honoring a “space”) is credible and resolves via a paid renunciation (letting Tomas’s presence fade). Interiority is specific to her craft, though a few lines edge toward abstraction. The final stance feels earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clear, consistent, and particular in his diligence and awakening, with tactile habits (winding, carving) revealing him. However, internal contradiction under pressure is light; his shift arrives smoothly rather than through contested impulses. The childhood-disappointment note hints at depth but doesn’t surface in a pressured beat. The final acceptance reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Elias wants to decode the tapestry to understand its creator’s intentions. Interiority is specific and sensorial, but there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle beyond patient curiosity. Micro‑choices exist (carry the case to the silo, work methodically), yet they face minimal pressure. The final stance shift reads more like affirmation than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear (seed innovation), and the tactile tremor at the quill’s first touch embodies pressure. However, interior conflict stays generalized—he “lets the quill guide him” rather than wrestling with a concrete risk or trade-off. The ease of the choice and absence of a visible price (beyond “doubters” later) flattens complexity. Result: credible but not cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s motive (“teach dust to tell stories”) is coherent and active, and her micro-choices—tuning the radio, transcribing, committing at dawn—align with it. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (copyist precision, sanctuary habits), though internal contradiction is light. The final stance (resolve to use the lyrics) is earned but the felt cost is modest. Still, the character reads particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (to honor the owner and crystallize impermanence) is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it. Interiority is textured but leans abstract at times, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The ritual choice carries modest emotional cost rather than a conflicted rupture. Still, micro‑choices (pausing at the mask, opening the pouch, powdering the air) reveal values credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive (preserve order) is clear and consistent, and the collapse forces a concrete choice that reveals his values. His interior conflict between logic and decay reads credibly, though some labels (“abrasive calm,” “rationally rebellious”) are told rather than embodied. The relationship with Lira functions as a crucible that pressures and slightly alters his stance. The change is modest but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her pivot—“we will sing not to be heard, but to listen”—aligns with her aim. Interiority is present but relatively generalized; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond “expectantly resigned” shifting to action. Secondary characters exert minimal pressure, keeping her choices low‑friction. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and interiority are clear and specific, with credible doubt (“What if the fruit didn’t work?”) countered by action (imbuing memories, pruning, finally tasting). Her grandmother’s pruning creed grounds a character‑particular shift rather than a generic epiphany. The change reads as earned, though the cost is gentle and mostly symbolic. A touch of sentimentality softens the edge of her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—preserving wonder via truth—tracks cleanly through her choices (opening the box, descending, touching the orb). Interiority is present but light on contradiction; her “involuntary truthfulness” isolates her but doesn’t create in‑scene friction. The decision to bear witness at the end is earned but carries minimal on‑page cost. Strong, if not deeply conflicted, characterization for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (to understand why some houses feel alive) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—collecting displaced objects, arranging them, speaking to them—align with his perceptual bias. Interiority is particular (“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush”) with embodied quietude, though true inner contradiction is minimal. The sanctification moment reveals him credibly under pressure, but the felt cost of adopting this calling is light. The arc ends in a believable reorientation rather than a wrenching change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s motive—quiet guardianship via telepathy—drives the central turn, and Elara’s certainty credibly fractures after the warning. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied, but the paradox of Liora (immovable yet connected) is distinct. Elara’s micro‑choice to delay and test reads, though her internal conflict is lightly sketched. The change feels earned, if emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive—to recover the “texture” of a missed moment—is specific, embodied by the dice, and her internal contradiction (grim optimism vs. vulnerability) is dramatized rather than told. The decisive internal shift arrives only after the chipped die is lost and she chooses to proceed with one, which forecloses a path. Emotions are concrete (“knuckles white,” breath steady), not diagnostic. The final renunciation (letting go) reads earned and paid for by the irrevocable loss of the mentor’s die.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (methodical hope and the need to prove strangers remember kindness) is stated early and coherently drives her choice to paint. Interiority is vivid and embodied (the brush’s hum, the jasmine air) but inner contradiction is minimal—she rarely resists or doubts, she mostly yields. Her final stance (“found your purpose”) reads earned but low-cost. The character is particular, though the arc leans more acceptance than contested change.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to save vanishing traditions—is clear and enacted through the concrete choice to bake and share the bread. Her interiority (“rosewater dread,” hope and fear) reads particular enough to her vocation and city. However, the cost to her is minimal; she risks little beyond vulnerability, which softens the crucible. The change is credible but emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystal clear and consistently drives action, with the counter‑clockwise rebellion nicely embodied in his craft. Interiority lands through tactile focus and the late mix of triumph and unease, though contradictions under pressure are modest rather than piercing. Micro‑choices (dismantling the yoyo, aligning symbols, the “final adjustment”) reveal method more than moral calculus. The felt cost registers at the end but his flaw set (hubris vs. fear) could be sharper in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motive (seeking answers and mastery over fear) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—opening the dictionary, handling the clasp, deciding to “unbosom”—track under pressure. Interiority is anchored in concrete images (mirrors, clocks) rather than labels. The core fear (being forgotten) arrives late but lands and directs the decisive act. The advisor adds external pressure, though status dynamics could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward’s desire to resolve “restlessness” via music is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (moving to the center, choosing notes, intensifying intent) align with that motive. However, internal contradiction is light—he rarely struggles or risks error—so the emotional cost of the shift reads modest. Embodied texture (bare, calloused feet; warm mallet) helps but doesn’t expose a conflicted hierarchy of values. The final peace feels earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive and method are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (hesitation, descent, blowing sequences) align with motive. Interiority is particular enough to feel lived-in, though contradictions are muted—she rarely struggles beyond a single beat of hesitation. The ending registers a credible endurance/renunciation (accepting scale and cost of the task) but the felt cost remains conceptual. A sharper on‑page price or conflicting impulse under pressure would deepen character torque.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive is explicit and consistent, and her micro‑choices (decoding the ledger, prying up the floorboard, descending to the archive) align with that drive. The “emotionally rational” trait informs her stance but rarely generates on‑page contradiction or cost in the moment. Interiority is clear but leans into summary over embodied tension. The ending registers a quiet reconfiguration rather than a hard choice with price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he’s driven to “excavate” and honor the vanished community—and his micro‑choices (wading in, salvaging the journal, placing the note) align. Interiority is tangible but low on contradiction; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. Embodied cost appears (raw hands, soaked clothes) but pressure never forces a hard trade‑off. The final stance shift (from surveyor to “keeper”) feels earned if modest.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives and temperament are clear and consistent, with a quiet tension between doubt and drive. Her micro‑choices (staying through the blackout, reading the margins, aligning the map, stamping) align with “trace honest origins.” However, she solves each turn with minimal resistance; the struggle feels low‑cost and competence‑smooth. The final sense of purpose is earned but pays a light emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motives and contradictions are legible: he tries to outcraft grief while fearing it will consume him, then chooses to face it by unfolding the crane. The embodied work (gem‑polishing, origami) grounds emotion. Lira applies immediate pressure with one pointed intervention. A slight neatness to the final acceptance trims complexity, but the cost reads.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is explicit and consistent—Zara seeks latent potential after a drone‑strike trauma—and her choices (going to the observatory, engaging the crystals, adopting the “hunt”) align. Interiority is concrete at times (“ash and char” scent; tactile crystal jolt), though some abstract labels (“unfiltered awakening”) flatten specificity. Internal contradiction is mild; she moves steadily from shock to purpose without a strong push‑pull of competing impulses. The closing renunciation of mere survival for “seeker” status feels earned, though the on‑page cost is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s goal is clear and consistent, and his occupational competence with the drone is credibly rendered. However, interior conflict is minimal, and “perpetually surprised” remains a surface label rather than a pressure-tested trait. The shift to “quiet resolve” lands, but with little felt cost or contradictory impulse on the page. Motivation carries the piece; complexity is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt and self‑loathing are specific and embodied (the watch hand biting his palm, the driftwood “clock” triggering memory). His contradictory impulses—complicity versus the need to atone—coexist on the page and culminate in a credible renunciation (“stop adding to the lies”). The theft of the watch smartly externalizes his moral entanglement. Slight safety remains in the tidy final resolve, but the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives and method (empathy, moon‑phase cadence, the drawer pull) are clear and consistently enacted, and her calm authority plays credibly against Kael’s guardedness. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely strains under competing impulses on the page. The final acceptance reads earned but tidy, with limited felt cost to her. Kael’s shift is plausible yet somewhat swift, more stance articulation than pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular interiority (shame, stubbornness, yearning) drives concrete micro‑choices: launching anyway, using poles, then tucking the compass away. Contradictory impulses—self‑recrimination versus forward motion—coexist credibly. The final renunciation feels earned by prior beats, though the emotional cost is relatively quiet. A few generalized phrases slightly smooth over messier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—seeking a clean slate yet pulled by lingering guilt—is clear and enacted through tactile choices (dropping the ball, wading in, diving deeper). Interiority is specific enough to avoid stock sentiment, but key realizations occasionally read as told thesis rather than dramatized struggle. The contradictory impulses (erase vs. understand) coexist credibly in scene. The final stance—carry empathy despite cost—feels earned by what precedes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and actions align (following the spices, choosing to conjure), but interiority leans on familiar formulations (“salvation and her curse”) and a tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses are hinted (ache vs. acceptance) but not pressure‑tested on the page. The cost of “letting go of the past” remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The guardian offers some relational pressure, yet Elara’s change feels relatively unresisted.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (seeking where lost time accumulates) is clear and embodied through tactile choices—handling the saucer, drawing cards, unfastening the brooch. Contradictory impulses (duty to craft vs. family presence) register without therapy‑speak. The shedding of the cloak reads as an earned renunciation with emotional cost. The final resolve is slightly tidy but credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is minimal and often stated rather than dramatized. Lines like “Violence could destroy, but only compassion could rebuild” read as thesis rather than pressure-tested interiority. The choice to heal by stitching lands, yet it costs her little on the page. She remains admirable, but not yet complex or contradictory under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to feel the “texture of transformation”—is clear and embodied in the detour and the costly release of her cherished bottle. The internal tug (pilgrimage plan vs. hush-led detour) reads as a credible micro-conflict. Interiority is concrete enough, though occasionally abstracted by thesis-like phrasing. The culminating renunciation feels earned by the prior patterning of purpose and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive and trait set (vigilant, calmly inventive, loyal to knowledge over hierarchy) drive concrete choices—decoding the sundial and activating the cradle. Status dynamics with Thorne register (his grip loosens; she seizes the opening), but her internal contradiction is thin and she rarely wavers. Embodied perception exists (fingers on lines, pressing to the wall) yet emotions skew summarized (“heart quickened”). The final choice is motivated but its cost to her relationship or position is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s drive—an obsessive need to decode sacred patterns—anchors choices (the rock‑sequence ritual, the decision to scatter the dust) and coheres under pressure. Interiority is clear but leans toward declarative summary at peak insight, muting contradiction beyond fear versus compulsion. Embodied moments (hands moving swiftly; the heart pounding) help, though the epiphany risks neatness. The final charged poise (new pattern/message) preserves character momentum beyond the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motives—shame, secrecy, and the compulsion to map scars—are clear and cohere into the choice to open the envelope and write uncensored. The hesitation is embodied through the timer and storm, not just labels. The internal contradiction (furiously tranquil vs. storm-charged fear) registers, though the cost of the turn is mostly implied. The “no longer just a censored poet” line veers toward declarative summary rather than dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s drive (“to turn questions into destinations”) is clear and governs his tactics; his “diplomatic fierceness” appears in how he presses Mara when she hesitates. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; the shift to accepting process over destination carries a conceptual, not visceral, cost. The mechanical arm offers texture and status cues but doesn’t meaningfully constrain his choices. The relationship dynamic turns when he seizes initiative, though the emotional price remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear—Elias wants to forge beauty from anarchy—and the monthly molting creates a credible inner tension that crystallizes into a felt “this self might stay.” Interiority is image‑driven and specific (patched coat, scrap verses), with Clara providing a steadying counterweight. However, pressure is gentle; we rarely see contradictory impulses collide in a difficult choice on the page. The permanence decision reads more lyrical than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—grief transmuted into a bid to outmaneuver fate—is clear and consistent, with a credible pivot from resignation to risk. Interiority is specific (clock, compasses, piano) and actions align with her traits, especially the decision to hunt the reel. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. hope) coexist on the page. The cost is largely emotional, not behavioral, but it reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear motivation and steady resolve, but interiority is generalized and largely unconflicted; Elara rarely feels torn or costs burden her on the page. The guardian’s test resolves too smoothly to expose contradictory impulses. Actions align with aims yet reveal little idiosyncratic flaw or limitation. The “luminous doubt” motif hints at complexity without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to seek a color that encodes unspoken apologies—is clear and threads his choices (studying, following, reading, relinquishing). His bonsai patience translates into methodical attention, and the final renunciation (leaving the compass and lace) carries a felt cost. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; he seldom resists, so pressure reveals less layered conflict than it could. Embodied emotion leans lyrical over physical strain, keeping us slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated ("to strip away the needless drama") but feels more like a thematic thesis than a deeply embodied internal conflict. The transition from a hard science like neutron star research to a mystical engagement with dust is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle or contradictory impulses. Her interiority often serves to articulate the story's themes directly, which keeps her from feeling like a fully realized, flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and evolves logically from abstract purpose to a concrete rescue mission. However, her interiority relies on over-articulated, diagnostic language, such as "to discover purpose in the pauses, to find meaning in the fragments of her shattered life." This states the theme rather than embodying a character's messy, contradictory thoughts in a crisis, which flattens the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, directly rooted in her identity as a musician. The internal conflict is present but slightly weakened by the literal color-coding of emotions via the heat-mapper (“blues for melancholy, greens for hope”), which tends to label rather than embody her complex state. Kael serves as an effective catalyst, but the dynamic between them remains functional rather than deeply explored. The final change is earned and lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in his profession. However, his defining trait, being "inadvertently stubborn," is asserted rather than dramatized; it doesn't force a difficult choice or come at a visible cost. The final emotional shift toward finding rest for himself feels slightly summarized and risks becoming a thematic statement rather than a fully embodied internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with it. However, her interiority feels more stated than embodied; the moment of internal conflict when the widow calls out is present but resolves too quickly to reveal deep contradiction. The character arc from anonymous helper to public leader is legible but lacks the friction or complex trade-offs that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and her spiritual curiosity drives the plot. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; once the path of sparks appears, she follows it without hesitation or contradictory impulses. The change at the end is significant, but it feels more like an inevitable discovery than a choice made under pressure, which slightly flattens the arc's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on some stock phrasing (“inexplicable pull,” “heart quickened”). The character is defined more by her obsession than by contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure. The final change is significant but feels more like a reward bestowed upon her than a state earned through a crucible of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character is a functional archetype, driven by a clear external goal, but lacks specific interiority. Motivation is stated rather than embodied; we are told their mind is "sharp" and movements are "patiently strategic," but we don't experience these qualities through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The liberator reads as a vessel for the plot's mechanics rather than a person grappling with the immense pressure of their task.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her emotions are believably embodied in the climax. However, the final realization feels slightly articulated rather than purely experienced. The line "Elara realized that..." veers into thematic summary, softening the raw interiority of the moment that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear but abstract, and her internal change is more summarized than dramatized. While her actions align with her "quietly savvy" trait, her interiority relies on labels like "her heart ached" and "felt a shift within herself" rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment. Elara's introduction and explanation feel efficient but lack deeper characterization through action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic self-awareness. Phrases like “The metaphor was not lost on her” and “she understood that those cracks were where the light entered” feel more like authorial summary than embodied emotion. The character’s internal conflict is explained rather than dramatized, which flattens the arc from a struggle to an observation of a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character concept is intriguing, but the execution relies more on labels than embodied action. Motivation is explicitly stated as a thesis ("to prove that vulnerability is power") rather than emerging from contradictory impulses in scene. While her determination is clear, the internal conflict between her phobias and resolve is summarized ("phobias warring with her determination") rather than demonstrated through a costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The oracle’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The shift when recounting the personal story—"voice faltered," "fingers trembling"—provides a crucial moment of embodied emotion, grounding the otherwise mythic character. While the internal conflict is subtle, the final earned stasis of quiet satisfaction and renewed purpose is convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The robot's motivation is clear and consistent, providing a strong central drive. However, the climactic change feels more like an intellectual summary than an embodied, contradictory experience. The shift from composed janitor to transcendent seeker is earned conceptually, but lacks the internal friction or embodied emotional detail that would make the final state of "quiet certainty" feel profound rather than simply stated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but the resolution relies on Kian being a perfect receiver. His characterization is thin, existing primarily to validate Elara’s gesture. The final dialogue, particularly the line “Like us. Like honesty,” is overly articulate and diagnostic, undercutting the emotional realism of the moment by summarizing the theme instead of embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a consistent archetype, but his interiority relies on summary and diagnostic self-awareness rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final realization ("Elias understood the true meaning...") reads as an unearned epiphany, an authorial conclusion placed into the character's mind without sufficient preceding struggle. His core motivation also seems to shift without clear cause from commemorating victories to proving something to himself.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is the clear engine of the plot, and her core trait of "icy warmth" is demonstrated by her calm during the crisis. However, the trait itself feels more like a label than a deeply embodied contradiction. The final shift from passion to responsibility is earned, but the internal conflict leading to it could be sharper and less reliant on abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her arc from observer to conduit is well-earned. However, her interiority occasionally relies on stock phrases ("her mind racing") and lacks the sharp, contradictory impulses expected under pressure, making her emotional journey feel slightly too smooth for the highest tier of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-realized, culminating in a strong, earned character change demonstrated by the final action of altering the illustration. However, the interiority relies on high-concept, slightly abstract labels like "auroral sorrow" and "swaying certainties," which feel more asserted by the narrative than fully embodied by the character, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but her core traits feel like labels rather than embodied realities. Her stated "recklessness" is contradicted by her cautious movements, and her "religiously skeptical" nature dissolves too quickly and without sufficient pressure to feel earned. The internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized, leading to a tidy resolution that lacks the weight of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear—to witness and preserve balance—and her choice to abandon passivity for action is a strong central turn. Her interiority is consistent, though occasionally relies on declarative labels like "grips reality loosely" instead of purely embodied perception. The final transformation is earned by the climactic trial, credibly shifting her from one who fears the "crumbling peace" to one who embodies its cyclical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but stated rather than dramatized through internal conflict. She is consistently gentle and mellow, but this lacks the contradictory impulses required for a top-tier score. Finn serves his purpose as a catalyst for Elara’s actions, but he remains a somewhat archetypal child figure. The characterization is functional and sweet but lacks the complexity and flawed humanity expected for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as perfectly competent, with her success hinging on a labeled trait ("sensitively perceptive") rather than demonstrated struggle or difficult choices. There is no internal conflict; her path is linear and her success feels preordained, which flattens her arc into a series of functions performed correctly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Li Wei's motivation is clearly stated but feels more asserted than embodied. The pivotal shift from passive writer to "maestro" happens via a sudden, abstract epiphany ("felt an sudden surge of clarity") rather than a difficult, internally conflicted choice. The character's internal state is summarized with labels like "renewed purpose" instead of being dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.5)
    The priest is a functional archetype, a vessel for the story's concept rather than a character with discernible interiority. Motivation is declared ("His mission was clear") but never tested by internal conflict or doubt. While his actions are consistent, he lacks embodied emotion or contradictory impulses, reading as a competent but remote figure executing a metaphysical task without personal cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is established but remains abstract, defined more by poetic labels like "chronologically homesick" than by concrete, contradictory impulses shown in scene. While the actions are consistent with the goal, the writer functions more as a necessary vessel for the story's aesthetic concept. The characterization lacks the granular, embodied emotion and internal conflict needed for the highest tier, reading as a type rather than a particular individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the protagonist's internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized through action. The final change of heart from "conquer" to "embrace" is an intellectual epiphany rather than a difficult choice earned under pressure. The resolution, "let the darkness and the brightness merge within her, and smiled," reads as a tidy summary of emotional processing instead of an embodied, costly act.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her central choice is well-defined. However, her interiority occasionally relies on declarative labels like "Emotional numbness had become her constant companion," which slightly abstracts the feeling rather than fully embodying it in the present moment of action. The final shift to "raw, aching aliveness" is a strong, earned change with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The character's motivation is clear and provides a strong internal conflict between solitude and action. However, key traits like being "credibly curious" or his skill in "lateral thinking" are stated as labels rather than consistently demonstrated through action. The final shift in motivation is earned by the plot, but its articulation feels slightly too self-aware and tidy for a character in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation—avoiding the pain of memory—is clear and consistent, effectively driving his initial hesitation. His internal conflict is palpable, and the final decision to grieve feels earned by the preceding visions. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("Elias realized then that the vial wasn’t just revealing memories—it was showing him the impact..."), which explains the psychological process rather than letting the reader feel it through embodied action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his final renunciation of the rope is earned by the climactic vision in the mirror. The internal conflict is well-staged in that moment. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "ethically playful" or "passionate subtlety," which feel more like authorial assertion than the character's own embodied experience, slightly distancing the reader from an otherwise strong core.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to find "beauty in the unfinished" is clear and consistent, driving her from hesitation to action. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her initial feeling of being swallowed by the hush. The change is earned through the discovery of the bowl and the memory it evokes, but the final emotional state reads as a slightly too-tidy resolution ("renewed sense of purpose") rather than a more complex, contradictory embodiment of her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and her internal conflict between empathy and professional detachment is well-realized. The character is compelling, but interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate self-diagnosis, such as the declarative "Her motivation was clear: to fuse insight with empathy..." This slightly flattens the voice, preventing an otherwise excellent portrayal from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization as a “shrewd seaside cargo broker” feels like an unfulfilled label. Her core traits of attentiveness and compassion are demonstrated, yet she lacks significant internal contradiction or flaw. The final change is earned, but the character arc feels gentle and predictable, without the friction of a genuine struggle against a competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the initial "luminescent ache" that credibly softens into "a quiet warmth." The change is earned. However, the characterization is slightly held back by moments of diagnostic self-awareness, where feelings are labeled rather than fully embodied, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear but her characterization is passive; she is largely pulled through the narrative by the magical pendant rather than making difficult choices. Her final epiphany, while thematically resonant, feels unearned as it doesn't resolve an on-page internal conflict or struggle. The story lacks a moment where contradictory impulses force a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("her mind racing with possibilities") and her shift from reading a dire warning to feeling "buried optimism" is too swift. The decision to proceed lacks the weight of embodied internal conflict, reading more as a necessary plot function than a deeply felt character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and the "kindly methodical" nature is demonstrated through action. However, the interiority relies too heavily on summarizing emotional states ("Their motivation burned brighter now") rather than embodying them through contradictory impulses in the moment. The final realization feels more like an articulated thesis statement than a hard-won, embodied change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-defined, but the execution leans on diagnostic labels like "reluctant metamorphosis" and "catalyst" rather than fully embodying the contradictory impulses in scene. Her shift from terror to liberation feels slightly abrupt. The characterization is strong conceptually but would benefit from less psychological summary and more demonstrated interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions effectively. However, the final internal shift relies on summary ("it all made sense now") rather than being fully dramatized through embodied experience. Additionally, the explicit mirroring of the trait "wryly earnest" between Elara and the old woman feels a bit too convenient, slightly diminishing the uniqueness of each character.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal transformation feels more asserted than earned. The shift from "gnawing doubt" to a "surge of purpose" is abrupt. The story tells us her epiphany—"Her gift was not to predict the future but to embrace the unknown"—rather than letting the reader feel the contradictory impulses and struggle that would make such a profound realization land with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal landscape is rendered with some stock phrasing ("her mind racing," "heart quickened"). The final change in her status from archivist to herald is more of a passive acceptance of a bestowed destiny than an earned choice made against a competing desire. The character arc is legible but lacks the friction of a deep internal conflict or a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "mind worked furiously"). The internal conflict is present but resolved with an unearned epiphany articulated as a direct moral statement ("the greatest maps are not drawn...with courage and curiosity"), which feels like a diagnostic label replacing embodied change.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation, a generic "void," is a weak engine for the story. Her core trait of "sympathetic skeptic" is asserted but not meaningfully tested; her skepticism dissolves with minimal internal friction rather than through a difficult, earned transformation. The character arc feels predetermined, lacking the messy contradictions of a genuinely conflicted individual. Phrases like "courageously kind hands" read as unearned thematic labels rather than demonstrated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot from the inciting incident to the climax. Elyr's internal state of an "endless, aching void" is a well-established trope for immortals, and while functional, the interiority relies on familiar phrasing rather than character-particular detail. The final transformation of this void into a "spark of purpose" is an earned change, representing a strong close to the character's arc within this scene. The characterization is competent and serves the narrative well, but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate it to an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her final epiphany relies heavily on the ink pot's external influence rather than a fully dramatized internal struggle. Her father’s shift from anger to weariness is a strong, credible moment. The final paragraph's self-aware realization ("Clara realized... it was about balance, honesty, and the courage...") reads as diagnostic, slightly undercutting the earned nature of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, but her primary traits ("studious," "patience") are often stated rather than dramatized through choices with conflicting costs. The characterization lacks significant internal contradiction; she is presented as perfectly suited to her task and succeeds without facing a difficult internal trade-off. The "rare expression of satisfaction" provides a nice closing note, but the journey to it feels emotionally linear.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poignant, rooted effectively in their unique status as a "death certificate error survivor." The moment of connection with Elara's son's letter provides a powerful, embodied emotional anchor. However, the interiority sometimes relies on conceptual labels like "filtered reality differently" rather than consistently showing this through specific, contradictory perceptions in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the "myth buster" profession is an undeveloped label that fails to create the promised internal conflict. Her transition from logic to intuition is too seamless, missing an opportunity for a more textured struggle. The emotional progression is well-handled but follows a somewhat linear path to acceptance without significant internal contradiction shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on labels like "culture shock absorber" and "orderly intuitive mind" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her interiority is summarized ("pride and exhaustion") instead of embodied. The conflict with Vorin is functional but brief, making him more of a caricature than a source of genuine pressure that forces Lira to make a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core choice to defy orders is well-established. However, her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart quickened," "lump formed in her throat," "heavy heart") that reports emotion rather than embodying it with specificity. This label-like approach to feeling prevents the characterization from reaching a higher tier of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is presented as an almost archetypal figure of serene competence, with her "magnetic calm" never truly tested. The story describes her as a "heartfelt artisan," but we see flawless execution rather than a struggle that would reveal the heart behind the skill, making her feel more symbolic than human.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative. However, her characterization relies more on labels than demonstrated traits; her "dry-witted" nature is never shown, and her "subtly confident demeanor" is asserted more than embodied until her purposeful walk. The internal state, described with stock phrasing like "storm of thoughts," lacks specificity, though the final emotional beat—tears of understanding, not joy—is a nuanced touch.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a functional archetype rather than a complex character. His motivation is clearly stated but lacks internal friction; he is infinitely patient and purposeful without any visible struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulse. While his actions are consistent, his interiority is summarized through labels like "cryptic" and "enigmatic," preventing a deeper connection. The characterization serves the story's fable-like tone but remains one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya’s motivation shifts from survival to discovery, but this change is declared rather than earned through struggle. Interiority relies on summary and diagnostic labels like "her motivation had shifted," which flattens the emotional arc. The character reads as a vessel for the plot's thematic goals rather than an individual with complex, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, but the execution of his internal conflict lacks depth. The lifelong pursuit of "hush" is stated but not felt, making his swift rejection of it after reading the journal feel more like a thematic necessity than an earned, difficult choice. The final realization is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity ("He wanted to be heard..."), replacing embodied struggle with a tidy summary of his new psychological state.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost bride’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict relies on telling rather than showing. Phrases like "lovingly venomous connection" and "mournful elation" are effective labels, but the contradictory impulses aren't fully embodied in her actions until the very end. The shift from a personal to a collective debt feels slightly abrupt, more of a sudden realization than a choice forced by escalating, contradictory pressures within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains at an allegorical level. There is no internal conflict; her "hauntingly optimistic" spirit is stated but never challenged by a moment of genuine despair or contradictory impulse. Emotions are labeled ("doubt and fatigue") rather than embodied, making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a complex individual whose choices carry a felt psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on labels like "warmly curious" rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The final change is legible but articulated via summary ("she found what she had been searching for: a sense of belonging"), which reads more as a diagnostic statement than an embodied, contradictory emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority is thin. Emotions are often labeled ("her heart quickened," "trembling hands") rather than embodied through specific, character-particular perception. The character reads as a competent agent executing a task, but the lack of internal conflict or palpable struggle keeps the portrayal from achieving significant depth.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, and her internal shift from artist to operative is the story's core. However, the transition from skepticism ("dismissed such talk as foolishness") to full belief happens very quickly upon Lira's arrival. Lira functions more as a plot device to deliver information than a character with her own internal pressures, making their dynamic feel more transactional than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. The internal conflict is established ("her voice lost in the silence of unspoken words") and culminates in a credible change. However, the interiority occasionally relies on evocative labels like "fierce tenderness" rather than more concrete, embodied emotion in the moment of climax, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on pre-digested, lyrical labels like "shrewdly innocent" and "lotus-hearted ache." These phrases feel more like authorial summary than a character's embodied experience under pressure. The final shift to "quiet determination" is earned by the plot, but the internal contradiction feels more described than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and consistent, but her internal journey relies more on external discoveries than on confronting a difficult internal contradiction. The transition from drained passion to "pensive mirth" feels slightly abrupt, more of an epiphany granted by the magical film than a hard-won internal shift. Her emotions are described rather than fully embodied, for instance, "a curiosity she hadn’t felt in years" is a label for a feeling, not the feeling itself.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a restorer is clear, and her core internal conflict between her "methodical nature" and the garden's call for "curiosity" is established. However, her pivot from hesitation to acceptance is very rapid and prompted by external direction rather than a deeply dramatized internal struggle. The final change feels more like compliance than a hard-won shift, slightly weakening the arc's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies on archetypes like the "charming rogue scholar" without fully dramatizing the "charming" aspect. His internal state is conveyed with some stock phrases ("heart quickened," "mind racing"). The shift from cautious operative to committed fighter at the end is earned by the plot, but the interiority leading up to it could be more specific and less generic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on evocative labels ("shyly unstoppable") rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her interiority is overly articulated, describing her process with a self-awareness that feels more like authorial summary than an embodied experience. While the arc from restlessness to peaceful creation is legible, the internal conflict lacks the grit of genuine struggle, reading as a smooth, almost idealized process of artistic sublimation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on elegant labels like "foxglove regret" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The emotional progression feels more asserted than embodied, particularly in the lead-up to the climax. While her actions are graceful and purposeful, her internal struggle lacks the texture and friction needed for a top-tier character study.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core trait of “carefully reckless” is a strong anchor. However, her internal process feels overly articulated, especially the three neatly categorized promises, which reads more like a summary of a character arc than a character living it. Kael’s immediate, total forgiveness at the end softens the earnedness of the change, making the resolution feel more convenient than cathartic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is more of a function than a character, a vessel for the plot's intellectual puzzle. His interiority relies on abstract labels ("ingenious," "dappled with doubt and hope") rather than embodied emotion or genuine internal conflict. The pivotal shift from trembling doubt to firm resolve happens via a convenient poetic epiphany, feeling unearned and emotionally thin for a story aiming for this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the pivotal change from writing "reinvention" to "truth" is summarized rather than dramatized. The interiority is specific, yet occasionally verges on diagnostic self-awareness, as in "the blooming and withering parts of her soul," which slightly abstracts the emotion instead of fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary trait, "featherly determined," reads as an un-dramatized label rather than an embodied characteristic that forces a choice. The final epiphany is mostly earned through the memory, but the interiority relies on some abstract assertions ("the code wasn’t meant to be read—it was meant to be felt") that slightly weaken the transition to her final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority slips into diagnostic self-awareness. The key realization—“belonging wasn’t about finding a place where you fit—it was about creating a rhythm”—is delivered as a tidy summary rather than an earned, embodied experience. This weakens the emotional credibility of her arc, making the change feel more like an intellectual conclusion than a deeply felt transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motivation is well-established through the personal backstory of her grandmother, making her quest feel both professional and deeply personal. The internal conflict is clear, though the final epiphany is articulated with a self-awareness that slightly lessens its emotional impact. Her core choice—to shift focus from memory to emotion—is a strong, earned turn that demonstrates character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a consistent but thin character, serving more as a vessel for the story's concept than a person with compelling interiority. His motivation is clearly stated but his past ("a cog in a machine") is summarized rather than felt, and his present actions lack any internal contradiction or struggle. Emotions are described with generic phrases like "smiled faintly," and his persona feels more like an authorial construct than an individual with a specific, embodied worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and her climactic choice to stand firm rather than flee is a strong, character-defining moment. The interiority effectively conveys the tension between her fear and her irrepressible artistic urge. However, the "skilled tide dancer" trait feels like an evocative label rather than an embodied skill that informs her specific actions in the scene beyond a metaphorical dance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias's motivation is clearly stated but never tested against resistance, making his final resolve feel preordained rather than earned. The interiority relies on abstract, high-concept labels like "noctilucent reckonings" rather than dramatizing a contradictory internal state. The character begins as a wise observer and ends as a wise observer with a mission, a shift in degree but not in kind, lacking a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but the final emotional shift feels more summarized than embodied. The interiority is strong until the climax, which relies on diagnostic language like "he began to enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance." This bypasses the messier, more contradictory internal process that would make the change feel fully earned, reading as a tidy emotional summary rather than a raw, character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation as a "logical dreamer" is clear and consistent, driving her actions. Her internal conflict is established but resolves into a slightly unearned epiphany rather than a choice born from simultaneous, contradictory impulses shown in-scene. While her actions align with her traits, the final change feels more like a conceptual shift than a deeply embodied struggle with a visible cost to her core identity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted effectively in the concept of a "legacy's burden." Her change from feeling this as a weight to embracing it as a purpose is earned. However, the internal conflict feels slightly muted; while "her fingers trembling" offers a moment of embodiment, her interiority during the climax favors summary ("She understood then") over experiencing the contradictory impulses of revelation and fear simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, but her characterization relies heavily on external descriptors like "perceptively calm" and "grace" rather than on demonstrated internal conflict. While the final tremble of her hands provides a welcome moment of embodied cost, her interiority remains somewhat opaque, making her feel more like a beautiful vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but her characterization relies too heavily on summary and labels. Phrases like "operatively gentle demeanor disarmed them" tell the reader the effect rather than showing the action. The climactic emotional break is a strong character choice, but the final cost is stated ("a cost she was still learning to bear") rather than embodied, which slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Characterization is exceptional, centered on the powerful internal contradiction of an "amoral philanthropist." This tension is not just stated but dramatized through her purposeful mission and secret sentimentality, culminating in the "trembling hands" at the climax. The line "a redemption she didn’t deserve but couldn’t deny" perfectly crystallizes her complex motivation, earning the final emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her characterization lacks depth. The "chaste courtesan" paradox is an intriguing label that remains undeveloped, as her actions don't stem from any conflict inherent in that role. Her resolve is stated as "unshakable" and she executes her task with "precision," which flattens the potential for internal conflict; we are told she feels the weight of the past, but this doesn't manifest as a visible struggle or a moment of difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear, but his interiority relies on abstract, writerly labels ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") rather than embodied emotion. The internal conflict is described more than it is dramatized, and the final shift to "peace" and "serenity" feels too quick and tidy, lacking the friction of a genuinely difficult internal struggle. Elias’s core contradiction is explained to us, not shown through competing impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "honor overlooked histories" is clear and consistent with her actions. However, her core trait as an "esoteric realist" is more asserted than dramatized; the potential internal conflict between seeing the world's harsh realities and its whispered secrets is not fully explored under pressure. The characterization relies on elegant summary rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority, while poetically described with phrases like "snowmelt ardor," relies on labels rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses in the moment. The final character change—finding her own name—is a powerful thematic beat, but the internal journey to that point, particularly the act of self-forgiveness, is summarized rather than experienced on the page, softening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    Foresight’s motivation is exceptionally clear, but the character functions more as a vessel for a concept than an individual with embodied, contradictory impulses. The interiority is abstract and explanatory, summarizing insights ("It was a tale of choices and consequences") rather than showing a mind grappling with them under pressure. The name "Foresight Hindsight Only" is thematically heavy-handed, reducing character to a label for the story's central idea.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael is defined by a collection of labels—"frugal," "empirically ironic," "skeptic and a seeker"—rather than through embodied choices under pressure. The central internal conflict between skepticism and faith is asserted ("often clashed") but not dramatized; it dissolves into an easy acceptance without a visible struggle or cost. His motivations are explained in summary ("stemmed from a deep-seated belief") instead of being revealed through action, resulting in a flat character arc that feels more like a foregone conclusion than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's characterization as a "scheming pacifist" is functional but underdeveloped; her method is direct rather than cunning. Kael's rapid emotional shift from hardened resentment to asking for help feels abrupt, undermining the earnedness of his change. The dialogue sometimes resorts to diagnostic label-speak ("Your grace. It's shifting, Kael."), which flattens the emotional complexity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is well-defined and consistent, but the stated internal conflict between her "firmly grounded nature" and her yearning is underdeveloped. This contradiction is summarized in the opening but doesn't manifest as a tangible hesitation or costly choice during the central action of recreating the sextant. She proceeds with the mystical task with professional focus, which, while competent, misses an opportunity for a deeper character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on labels ("endearingly feisty") than on demonstrated actions that reflect these traits. The internal conflict is present, but the shift from despair to hope hinges on an epiphany that feels slightly sudden rather than earned through a granular struggle. The character reads as a consistent vessel for the theme, but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate her beyond an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated ("to pursue forbidden knowledge") and consistent, but her internal journey feels summarized rather than dramatized. The shift from "bewildered curator" to "heir" is an unearned epiphany, confirmed by an external info-dump rather than a difficult choice with a felt cost. Her interiority relies on abstract labels like "simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet," which tell the reader her state instead of embodying it through specific, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s character is functional but thin, defined by the label “carefully resourceful” rather than through compelling, contradictory choices under pressure. Her competence feels pre-ordained, making her journey through the labyrinth lack a sense of genuine struggle or internal conflict. Kael exists solely to deliver the stakes, possessing no character beyond his function.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent. However, her interiority relies on abstract, pre-packaged labels like "unkindled solace" and "blissfully aberrant" rather than showing these states through contradictory impulses in scene. The climactic realization is delivered by an externalized voice of her twin, which feels more like a thematic instruction than a fully earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated but lacks embodied depth; phrases like "Her motivation was clear" and "Her method was clear" substitute assertion for dramatization. While her actions are consistent, her defining traits of "adaptability" and "warmly methodical" read as labels rather than characteristics tested under pressure. The characterization is functional and serves the plot, but lacks the internal conflict or specific interiority needed for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is thin. She reads as a competent functionary executing a task rather than a character with internal conflict; her resolve is stated ("heart steady," "resolve") but never truly tested. The lack of any contradictory impulse or moment of doubt makes her feel more like a vessel for the plot than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in a high-stakes choice with a tangible cost. However, the motivation itself—"to prove that coincidences have meaning"—remains abstract, and the interiority leading to the sacrifice feels more like a logical justification than an embodied, contradictory struggle. The emotional landscape is described more than it is inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated but feels more like a label than an internal pressure tested by the scene. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice with a visible trade-off. The final realization, while fitting, reads more as an articulated summary than a hard-won epiphany emerging from contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear but abstract, making her feel more like a symbolic catalyst than a character with complex interiority. Phrases like "her resolve deepened" are functional but lack specific embodiment. Her unwavering competence and the absence of internal conflict or doubt create a low-friction journey, making her actions feel pre-ordained rather than chosen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state is more declared than embodied. Phrases like "Her motivation was singular" and the neat shift to a new motivation feel overly articulated, bordering on diagnostic. While the change is earned by the story's logic, the experience lacks the contradictory impulses or messy emotional texture of a deeply felt epiphany, reading more like a philosophical realization.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to collect "flavors of silences" is exceptionally clear and particular, grounding her internal conflict well. Her actions are consistent with her claustrophobia, and the doll effectively embodies her connection to hope. The final change feels earned, though the prose describing her state under pressure ("her tone stretching contracted") is awkward and slightly undermines the moment's emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characters feel more like archetypes serving a theme than complex individuals. Mira's internal turmoil is stated but her rapid resolution feels unearned. The dialogue, particularly Elias's lines like, “When we’re troubled, it shows us what we need to address,” borders on diagnostic therapy-speak, flattening his character into a mouthpiece for the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains functional rather than deeply compelling. She is defined by her role ("lore keeper") and a stated trait ("wisely adventurous") without much internal contradiction or embodied emotion beyond a "quickened heart." The story shows her competence, but her journey lacks a genuine struggle that would reveal a more complex inner landscape or force a difficult trade-off between her wisdom and her adventurousness.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her climactic choice feels consistent with her role as a guardian. The cost is embodied in the "hollow ache," which grounds the sacrifice. However, the motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" reads as a slightly overwrought thematic label rather than a deeply held, contradictory impulse, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal journey feels shallow and compressed. The trait "virtuously mischievous" is stated rather than dramatized through a choice with tangible trade-offs. The final shift to hope is asserted in a summary, rather than earned through a deeply felt internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor's motivation is exceptionally clear, providing a strong anchor for the narrative. However, her characterization lacks deep interior contradiction; she proceeds with a singular determination that is never truly tested. The repetition of "eloquently silent" feels like a label rather than an embodied trait, and her final transformation into the "keeper of a hidden truth" is asserted more than it is emotionally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alaric's transformation from withdrawn to empowered is clear and earned within the story's mystical logic. However, his motivation is delivered via a direct, diagnostic statement ("That was his motivation...") at a peak moment, which slightly lessens the interiority's impact by telling instead of dramatizing the character's core drive.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes relies on diagnostic self-awareness. Phrases like "to magnify small kindnesses" and "It was a way to mend her own brokenness" feel more like thematic labels than embodied emotion. The character arc is earned, but the expression of it lacks the specific, contradictory texture of a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions align with her established trait of resourcefulness. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("weight of her mission pressing on her shoulders"), and the core motivation—"the tyranny of indifference"—reads as a slightly abstract label rather than a deeply embodied internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, the interiority feels more stated than embodied; phrases like "haunted him for weeks" provide context but lack immediate, in-scene friction. The character serves the concept well but remains a vessel for the music and magic rather than a complex individual with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state is one of smooth acceptance rather than conflicted choice. The transformation from "orderly seed sorter" to "weaver of tales" is the central arc, but it lacks the friction of genuine struggle or contradictory impulses. Her transition into a "guardian of forgotten truths" is asserted as a realization rather than earned through a costly decision, making the change feel somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tinkerer’s core motivation is consistent, but his final internal shift feels more declared than earned. The interiority becomes overly diagnostic at the end, with lines like “he had befriended uncertainty in planning” summarizing the change rather than embodying it through a final, difficult micro-choice. The initial pull toward the compass is described as “inexplicable,” which is a slight shortcut around deeper character motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally relies on declarative summary rather than embodied experience. The climactic epiphany is articulated as a realization ("She understood now...") rather than dramatized purely through perception and action, slightly softening its impact. Her hesitation at the furnace provides a moment of genuine internal conflict, though it resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but the specific goal "to integrate laughter into healing" feels like an abstract thematic label rather than a tangible driver for this particular scene, which is centered on profound sorrow. Her trait "modestly fearless" is also stated rather than demonstrated through a choice made under pressure. The father's grief is powerfully embodied, but Elara's interiority relies on the repeated phrase "luminous ache," which borders on a label.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling. However, the final internal shift feels more like a declared epiphany than an earned, embodied change. The line "Mercy, she realized, was not about erasing pain but about understanding its purpose" is a form of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the visceral struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives her actions consistently. However, her interiority lacks contradiction or meaningful struggle; she reads as a highly competent agent of the plot rather than a complex individual. Emotions are described rather than embodied, and her success feels inevitable from the start, which lessens the impact of her achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking his professional methodicalness to his supernatural gift. His interiority is concrete, though phrases like "weightless burden... both a curse and a calling" veer close to thematic summary rather than embodied contradiction. The character's actions are well-aligned with his established traits, making his progression through the scene feel earned and logical.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her initial actions. However, her internal journey from a seeker of perfect order to an accepter of malleable reality feels more summarized than dramatized. The transition lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she moves from intrigue to acceptance too smoothly, making the final smile feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation for redemption is clear and compelling, but her final emotional state is summarized rather than dramatized. Phrases like "her own wounds remained unhealed" and the list of sorrows feel like labels applied after the fact, missing the opportunity to show her complex interiority through a final, contradictory action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation pivots on a generic "curiosity," which feels thin for the epic journey that follows. While his skills as a repairman are central, his interiority remains underdeveloped; his emotional state is often stated ("hands trembling") rather than embodied. The final epiphany feels more like a thematic summary delivered to the character than a personally earned transformation rooted in internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "sensibly eccentric" rather than demonstrating the trait through contradictory actions. Her interiority is functional but dips into stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "her breath catching"), which slightly flattens emotional specificity at key moments. The final renunciation is well-motivated by the scene's events, but the groundwork for such a profound shift feels more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation is explicitly and repeatedly stated using abstract phrases like “to scaffold complexity with simplicity,” which reads more like a thematic thesis than an embodied drive. Her interiority is a summary of intellectual goals (“her mind a turbine-hum reverie of ideas”) rather than a depiction of contradictory impulses under pressure. While her actions are consistent, the character feels like a vehicle for the story's concept, lacking the specific flaws or internal conflicts that would make her choices feel costly or deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively tying her artistic project to a deeper, personal quest. However, her interiority often relies on declarative, abstract labels like "quietly driven" or feeling "awe and sorrow," rather than fully embodied emotion. While her actions align with her motives, the character's internal conflict and emotional progression feel somewhat sanitized, culminating in an epiphany that is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels like “retrocognitively trapped” and “searing reverie” rather than embodied emotion. While her actions align with her stated goals, her character feels more like a vessel for the theme than a person with contradictory impulses. The lack of specific, character-particular interiority prevents the characterization from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks internal friction. The story states her philosophy ("She rejected the false comfort of nostalgia") rather than dramatizing a choice where comfort was a tempting alternative. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her mind racing with questions") and declarative statements, making her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a character with contradictory impulses navigating a difficult task.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and compellingly deepened by the story’s end, but her interiority lacks specificity and internal conflict. Her journey is a linear progression of discovery without doubt or struggle, making her feel more like a vessel for the plot than a complex individual. The characterization is functional but misses the opportunity for deeper emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but highly abstract ("discover the texture of borrowed time"), which makes her interiority feel more conceptual than embodied. The opening state of "furiously tranquil" is a compelling contradiction, but the "furious" aspect isn't dramatized in her choices, which are calm and direct. The final epiphany and acceptance of responsibility feel more like a sudden summary of a new mindset rather than a change earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear but lacks compelling internal conflict. His progression from scientific observer to mystical conduit is frictionless, driven by a state of being "credibly curious" rather than a choice born from contradictory impulses. The pivotal action—"Without thinking, he gave it a gentle tug"—undercuts his agency, making the discovery feel more like a passive reception than an earned breakthrough against internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on a told epiphany rather than an earned one. The moment of change is summarized with diagnostic language (“The concept of flourishing stillness crystallized in her thoughts”), which flattens the interiority by stating the theme directly instead of embodying a struggle or contradiction. Her journey feels frictionless, making her less a complex individual and more a receptive vessel for the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is more of a vessel for the plot than a character with a compelling internal journey. His motivation is handed to him by a magical object, and his transition from "astonished recluse" to "guardian" is asserted rather than earned through difficult choices or internal conflict. Contradictory impulses are absent; he moves from one state to the next with a placid acceptance that undercuts any sense of personal transformation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear (fix time), but her interiority is conveyed through labels like "laced with anticipation" and "profound sense of purpose" rather than embodied experience. Her central plan—the garage sale—is creative, but her character feels passive once Thaddeus arrives, as he simply provides all the answers. Thaddeus functions more as a convenient plot device than a developed character who applies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The characters are thematically coherent but lack psychological depth. Their motivations are stated explicitly rather than revealed through contradictory actions, making them feel more like archetypes in a fable than individuals. The dialogue, particularly the man's confession ("I forgot how to find it"), serves as a direct thematic summary rather than naturalistic speech, flattening his character into a vessel for the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on abstract labels like "bridge between worlds" rather than embodied contradiction. His defining trait, "brazen calm," is maintained so perfectly that it lacks the texture of genuine internal struggle, reading more as a static state than a choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her core trait—"luminous skeptic" with an "academically rebellious nature"—is asserted more than dramatized. The key moment where this trait should act ("urged her to question him, but the bronze quiet...silenced her") shows the trait being suppressed rather than complicating a choice. The final shift from skepticism to "quiet awe" feels more like a declared outcome than an earned, visceral change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coachman's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. However, his characterization leans more towards a potent archetype than a psychologically complex individual. The interiority is consistent but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in-scene; feelings like hope are stated ("felt a spark of something new—possibility") rather than fully embodied in a moment of difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation rests on a generic "curiosity, long dormant," and his final change from isolation to connection feels more like a thematic requirement than a character-driven choice earned through struggle. The internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized, and the cost of abandoning his solitude isn't felt on the page. Lira functions purely as a plot device to deliver the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized. The interiority relies on abstract labels ("heart heavy with purpose," "deliberate act of defiance") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in-scene. The final shift to purpose feels like an asserted epiphany ("in that realization, Elara found her purpose") rather than a choice earned through a visible struggle, making the change feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear, but the internal state is conveyed through labels ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful nature") rather than embodied through specific, contradictory actions or thoughts. The final character change is stated directly in a summary paragraph, which undercuts the emotional weight earned in the chess scene. Kael feels more like a well-defined archetype than a particular individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal change feels more summarized than earned. The line "She realized that her crisis acting had been a way to connect..." is a form of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the impact of the preceding scene. Kael functions more as a thematic guide than a fully realized character; his "benevolently ruthless" trait is stated but not dramatized, leaving him feeling a bit one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal state is often described with abstract labels and unearned epiphanies. The final realization feels more like a diagnostic summary ("Home was not a place but a state of being, a harmony of her fragmented self") than an embodied, contradictory experience. The swift shift from "fragmented" to "whole" lacks the dramatized struggle that would make it fully credible.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative. Her methodical approach to the tapestry is a strong character moment that aligns with her identity as a chess tutor. However, her internal change is slightly undercut by summary, as in "the weight of her guilt began to lift, replaced by a quiet resolve," which reports the shift rather than embodying it in a final, contradictory impulse or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and drives the scene effectively. However, her interiority occasionally slips into abstract summary rather than embodied emotion, particularly at the climax. The final declaration, "I am the shattered mirror… Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal," feels more like an authorial thesis statement than a raw, in-the-moment realization, bordering on the diagnostic self-awareness the rubric cautions against.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently stated, but her interiority feels more declared than embodied. Phrases like "her motivation was clear" and "her core concept was kintsugi intentions" are authorial labels that distance the reader. The character's uncertainty is asserted but her actions are quite linear and competent, creating a slight disconnect. The final epiphany feels more like a thematic summary than a hard-won, contradictory internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from aloofness to connection is the story's backbone. The contradiction between seeking timelessness and finding peace in the temporary is well-conceived. However, her interiority occasionally relies on diagnostic summary ("a metaphorical shattering," "fragments of herself") rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly softens the impact of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict resolves via confirmation from an external agent rather than a difficult, earned choice. The interiority is mostly concrete, with "a screaming tenderness" being a standout moment of specific embodiment. However, the resolution feels too tidy, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses acting in a climactic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her arc from isolated warden to community anchor is earned. However, her interiority relies on labels like "raw solace" (used twice) and "sense of purpose" rather than more concrete, embodied emotion. The characterization is strong and consistent, but lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation for psychological safety is clear and consistent, providing a strong anchor. The internal conflict between his rational mind and the supernatural reality he confronts is well-drawn. However, his final realization is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity ("psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths..."), which reads less like an earned, embodied shift and more like a tidy thematic summary, slightly flattening the character's arc at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative from his obsession with “gaps” to his final acceptance of the stranger’s burden. His interiority is well-rendered, and his final emotional shift feels earned by the discoveries in the journal. The characterization is very strong, stopping just short of exceptional because his internal state, while clear, lacks a significant contradictory impulse acting in-scene; his resolve is steady rather than forged through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is thin and motivation is weak. Elias is a passive recipient of the plot; his defining trait, "empirically intuitive," is stated but never meaningfully demonstrated to drive a choice. His shift from lonely to purposeful is an unearned epiphany delivered by an external agent rather than a change earned through struggle or a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The queen's motivation is clear, but her internal state is more declared than embodied. The transition from "disenchanted" to "purposeful" is abrupt and summarized in the final sentences ("The disenchanted queen was no longer disenchanted..."), which undercuts the emotional weight of her supposed transformation by telling the reader the conclusion rather than letting them feel it being earned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but characterization relies heavily on evocative labels ("pocket-sun alchemist," "scientifically romantic") rather than dramatized internal conflict. Kael functions more as an idealized witness than a character applying pressure; his immediate, complete understanding of Elara's abstract goal feels convenient. The relationship is central, but its depiction lacks the crucible of friction or misunderstanding, making the final connection feel pleasant but not deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation and internal conflict are well-defined and consistent. The envy of past selves is a strong, particularized struggle. However, the resolution feels slightly simplified by the direct, instructive dialogue from her past selves ("You just forgot how to see it."), which verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a messier, more embodied process of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal state of "trembling calm" is well-embodied. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic label-speak, particularly in the final paragraph ("she realized that her loss of smell had not diminished her ability to map emotional terrain"). This abstracts her epiphany rather than grounding it in a fully embodied, character-specific moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively externalized through the quill. The contradiction between her scholarly knowledge and resurgent youthful fears is well-dramatized. However, the resolution feels slightly too self-aware; the line "transforming them into a story of resilience" reads like diagnostic label-speak that slightly undermines the earned, embodied nature of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc towards acceptance is legible. However, her core internal conflict feels more summarized ("her own story felt tangled") than embodied in contradictory impulses. The final resolution arrives as a somewhat tidy epiphany rather than a choice born from a sustained, messy struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character is an archetype, a vessel for the story's concepts rather than a person with discernible internal conflict. Motivation is stated ("unravel cosmic illusions") but not tested through meaningful, contradictory choices. The "wanderingly exact" attribute is a label that isn't dramatized; we see no trade-off or struggle where this paradoxical quality creates friction. The emotional landscape is uniformly serene and purposeful, lacking the embodied, messy contradictions of a compelling character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal state is often summarized ("his mind racing") rather than embodied. The final change is an epiphany, but because the inciting discovery is accidental, it feels more found than earned. The characterization lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in a scene; his path to understanding is linear once the coincidence occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core internal conflict is well-defined, rooted in her father's philosophy versus her professional duty. However, the transformation feels less earned and more delivered, as the mysterious figure functions as a mouthpiece for the theme rather than a genuine crucible. The final change is credible, but the path to it lacks a crucial, self-driven struggle; the epiphany is given, not seized.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is well-rendered, particularly her pragmatism warring with a desire for answers. The character is consistent, and her final micro-choice to write feels like a natural culmination of her contemplation. However, traits like "theoretically rebellious" and the feeling of "clover melancholy" read as slightly over-articulated labels rather than fully embodied contradictions shown through action within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and his final change is earned and powerful. However, the articulation of his central epiphany—“to teach endings how to begin”—reads as slightly too polished and authorial, a diagnostic summary that momentarily flattens the character’s voice during a peak moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s motivation is explicitly and repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Her interiority relies on stock phrases like "curiosity was piqued" and "heart swelling with a sense of purpose," which function as labels rather than embodied emotion. The character acts as a passive, idealized vessel for the theme, lacking the internal contradictions or flaws that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    The character's motivation is clear and establishes the story's core stake effectively. However, her defining internal conflict ("desperately jocular" humor as a shield) is summarized rather than dramatized, making the final shift to "genuine" laughter feel more declared than earned. The climactic change is an epiphany granted to her, which lessens the impact of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is established clearly but is overly articulated, reading like a diagnostic label ("Her motivation was clear: to navigate uncharted emotional depths..."). While her actions are consistent, her interiority lacks genuine contradiction; she follows a linear path to enlightenment without the friction of competing impulses. The final change is earned by the plot, but the internal experience feels more summarized than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her primary character trait, "confidently uncertain," is stated more than dramatized. The internal conflict lacks an on-page crucible; she steps into the void and acts with conviction, making the "uncertain" aspect feel like a label. The final sentence, "And in that, she found her peace," provides a tidy emotional resolution that slightly undermines the complexity of her stated paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but often stated directly ("to translate silence into music") rather than revealed purely through action. The internal conflict between past influence and present obscurity is established, but her emotional state is sometimes labeled ("a bittersweet expression that carried both joy and sorrow") instead of fully embodied in perception. While the final change is coherent, the characterization relies more on elegant summary than on contradictory impulses being dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's core contradiction, "volcanic tenderness," is stated but never dramatized. Their actions are methodical and competent, showing the "tenderness" but none of the "volcanic" impulse, which flattens the internal conflict. Motivation remains abstract; we understand the goal is to "rescue a forgotten promise," but the personal stakes that would fuel such a singular drive are absent, rendering the character more of a functional cipher for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between victimhood and agency is established. The drumming habit is an effective piece of embodied characterization that pays off structurally. However, her interiority sometimes relies on slightly generic poeticisms like "quietly rebellious" or "auroral sorrow" instead of more character-particular perception, and the final epiphany, while earned by the scene's events, feels emotionally swift for the depth of the stated trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eli's motivation crystallizes around a thematic concept—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—which feels more like an authorial thesis than a deeply personal need. The internal conflict is present but not fully dramatized, and the final realization is summarized ("In the end, Eli realized...") rather than shown through a changed action or perception. While Mira's shifting walk provides a good external reflection of the dynamic, Eli's own interiority remains somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's characterization is consistent and serves its symbolic function well, but lacks the internal contradiction expected at the highest level. Their motivation is stated rather than revealed, making them feel more like a narrative device than a person. The stranger is a well-executed archetype of despair, and their change is credible within the scene, but the guardian's unwavering, almost supernatural competence keeps the dynamic from feeling truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks depth or contradiction. Elias is a vessel for the story's theme rather than a complex individual; he experiences no meaningful internal conflict or doubt. His "unique attribute" is asserted but never dramatized to force a difficult choice, rendering it a character label rather than an active trait.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal conflict relies on abstractions like "a guarded heart." The final state of "combative tenderness" is stated rather than fully embodied in a closing action. While consistent, the character arc feels more like a symbolic outline than a deeply particularized emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens effectively with the introduction of her brother's story. Her internal conflict is well-realized through the contrast between her blank exterior and rich interiority. However, the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic language, such as explicitly stating her motivation "to cultivate lightness in grief," which slightly flattens the character's voice into a summary of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization remains somewhat archetypal. Interiority is conveyed through abstract labels like "a tremor of certainty" rather than through deeply embodied, contradictory impulses. While the poet undergoes a significant change, they function more as a receptive vessel for the story's mystical event than as a complex individual whose specific flaws or internal conflicts drive the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic summaries (e.g., “His motivation was no longer to replicate... but to capture...”). This self-awareness feels unearned and flattens the internal conflict. The final realization is told directly to the reader rather than embodied through a difficult micro-choice or contradictory impulse, softening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity. The journey from curiosity to epiphany is summarized rather than embodied; lines like "She questioned her assumptions about progress" and "Elara felt her understanding deepen" state the outcome without showing the messy, contradictory process. The final change is earned by the story's events, but it feels like a neat intellectual conclusion rather than a visceral shift.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent with her actions. However, her transformation feels passive; the pivotal moment where the stencil becomes a tattoo happens *to* her rather than resulting from a difficult, character-driven choice. The line "Without thinking, she picked up the stencil" underscores this lack of agency, making her renewed determination feel more like a gift received than a state earned through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her "steadily curious" nature. However, her internal state is more intellectual than embodied; her shift to "hope" at the end feels asserted rather than earned through a visible internal struggle. Mira serves as an effective catalyst but remains thinly characterized, primarily defined by her function in the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict of “anguished joy” provides a solid core. However, her interiority often relies on repeating abstract, thematic labels (“atoms of nostalgia”) rather than embodying the conflict through specific, contradictory perceptions or micro-choices. The result is a character who articulates her own themes with a bit too much diagnostic clarity, slightly undermining the sense of a mind genuinely grappling with the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is present, but it sometimes relies on abstract, high-concept labels like "luminous regret" rather than fully embodied emotion. Her defining traits ("sharp-eyed," "softly deliberate") are consistently shown, though the repetition borders on making her feel slightly one-note. The final choice feels earned and consistent with the established character, representing a credible arc from intellectual curiosity to shared emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is over-articulated, presenting as a summary of healing rather than a dramatized process. Phrases like "The method of her healing, she realized, would be by shedding layers" and "finding a new way to balance self-respect and compassion" read as diagnostic label-speak. This replaces the messy, contradictory work of an internal struggle with a tidy, unearned epiphany, flattening the character's journey into a therapeutic outline.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation as a "closure seeker" is clear, but its execution relies more on direct statement than embodied action. The resolution feels somewhat unearned, summarized with phrases like "a sense of closure she had never known" and "the scars on her soul began to fade." This leans toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the emotional complexity of the change instead of dramatizing it through a more contradictory or visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and compellingly unusual. Her actions consistently align with her stated goal. The final shift from a quest for knowledge to a commitment to action is earned by the scene's events, particularly her reflection on her own unspoken loves, which gives the choice a personal cost. Interiority is strong, though a few phrases like "her mind racing" are slightly generic for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is well-established through phrases like "shadowed rapture." However, her internal conflict is more described than dramatized in the moment; the "mixture of fear and exhilaration" at the end feels a bit summarized. The characterization is strong and specific but stops just short of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s motivation is explicitly and clearly stated, which drives the plot forward. However, her characterization remains thin; traits like being a "dreamless freight guard" are asserted but don't manifest in her choices or internal experience. The final shift in understanding feels more like a thematic conclusion assigned to her rather than an earned, character-driven epiphany born from internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eamon's motivation is clear and consistent—the search for insight. However, his characterization relies more on the archetype of the "stray philosopher" than on specific, contradictory impulses shown in scene. The final shift in motivation is earned by the plot, but his interiority during the climactic epiphany is summarized ("filling him with a clarity he had never known") rather than embodied, which keeps the character at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, if somewhat archetypal. Her interiority effectively conveys a state of weary searching, though it sometimes veers into summarizing emotion rather than embodying contradictory impulses in the moment (e.g., "She felt the weight of their footsteps"). The ferryman serves his purpose as a wise guide archetype well. The final change is earned within the story's allegorical logic, though the internal conflict could have been sharpened with more specific, contradictory thoughts during the traverse.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clearly stated ("to understand the cost of safety"), and his final choice to remain is a logical conclusion to his arc. However, the pivotal change is triggered by an external information download from the bolt, rather than a climax born of internal contradiction or struggle. This makes the epiphany feel more received than earned, thinning the character's agency at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, her interiority, while serviceable, lacks deep contradiction; her resolve is presented as a static quality rather than a process forged in struggle. The pretender's shift from defiance to desperation is well-tracked but remains external, seen only through their annotations and final collapse, making them more of a plot function than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her interiority is consistent, particularly the specific habit of tapping rhythms to process chaos. However, her core intellectual puzzle is stated directly ("the question that had haunted her for months: why some paths disappear") rather than fully emerging from embodied struggle, slightly softening the character's internal contradiction in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her internal change is the story's focus. The transformation from "awkward confidence" to "resolute" is a strong beat. However, the final epiphany feels more magically bestowed than earned through struggle, relying on an external catalyst rather than a choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s character is consistent and her motivation is clear. The micro-choice to feign frailty before the guard ("I'm just an old woman") is a strong moment that reveals her tactical mind. However, her interiority sometimes relies on generic phrasing like "humming with an unfamiliar energy," which keeps the characterization from feeling truly particular and sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Zara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her interiority suffers from diagnostic label-speak. The line "Through somatic markers—a survival mechanism honed by years of trauma—" explains the character's psychology to the reader rather than embodying it. The emotional progression at the climax feels too tidy, moving from a trauma flashback to a lucid epiphany with unearned speed, lacking the contradictory impulses of a genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and her internal arc from despair to renewed purpose is legible. The emotion is embodied in the "trembling hands" and the evolving "ache." However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic language ("untangling the threads of her own despair," "redesigning her perspective"), which feels more like a summary of the psychological process than a raw, in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her arc from seeking control to finding acceptance is complete. However, the pivotal emotional shift feels slightly unearned, relying on a quickly delivered epiphany ("She understood now") rather than a more deeply dramatized internal struggle. The concept of "serene anger" is potent, but the resolution feels more like a tidy intellectual summary than a messy, embodied emotional process.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her core internal conflict is stated ("bravely conflicted") rather than fully embodied. Her actions proceed with a purpose that sometimes undercuts the supposed turmoil. The transition from trembling hesitation to decisive action feels compressed, making the internal state read more like a label than a deeply felt contradiction acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—pacifism versus pragmatism—is established. However, the resolution of this conflict is more summarized than dramatized; her acceptance of the blade and the subsequent fortification of the farm occur too smoothly. The story tells us she has found a new path, but we don't witness the difficult internal work required to earn that stasis, which slightly undermines the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, culminating in a credible internal shift. However, his defining trait of being "cool-headed" feels slightly at odds with the deep, almost mystical emotional pull that drives him. The interiority, particularly the recurring phrase "emotions were being transliterated," is more of an abstract label than a concretely embodied experience, which slightly distances the reader from his internal state during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear, but her internal state often relies on abstract labels like "orbits of regret" rather than fully embodied emotion. The stated trait of "solemn playfulness" is asserted rather than demonstrated, particularly in the summarized meeting with the director, which misses a key opportunity to show this contradiction under pressure. Her final "sense of peace" feels slightly unearned for the small symbolic act performed against a vast conspiracy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal arc relies more on summary than embodied action. The final shift from guilt to peace is declared in an epiphany ("she had learned to listen") rather than fully dramatized through the difficult process of writing, making the change feel slightly abrupt and intellectually neat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is tracked via the “lilac unease,” but the characterization relies on labels like “whimsical” and “socially perceptive” rather than consistently dramatizing these traits through action. The final shift in her perspective is earned, but the interiority occasionally feels more explained than embodied, especially in the opening where her perception is diagnosed for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but abstractly rendered through labels like "gentle radical" and "heart both warm and cold." Her interiority consists of thematic statements ("Mercy, she believed, should not be a rarity...") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her defining trait of being "retrocognitively trapped" is used as a simple framing device for a flashback, not a dynamic internal conflict that complicates her choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her character is somewhat flattened by dialogue that serves thematic exposition. The choice to help her echo is compelling, yet the internal conflict feels muted. The line, “This is your echo... It’s not just mine—it’s ours,” reads more like an authorial explanation than an authentic utterance, undercutting the moment's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on stated labels ("affectionate skeptic") than on dramatized internal conflict. Her interiority feels summarized, particularly in the pivotal moment of inspiration where the plan arrives via the abstract concept of "somatic markers" rather than through a more embodied or contradictory thought process. The core contradiction is presented but not fully tested in scene, making her progression feel a little too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, progressing logically from professional curiosity to a deeper sense of purpose. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she is more of a receptive vessel for the story's wonders than an agent struggling with contradictory impulses. The shift to "storyteller" is an intellectual realization rather than an emotionally costly, earned transformation, as evidenced by the summary line "their lives and struggles mirrored in her own."

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly, but her characterization relies more on her graceful actions and stated purpose than on dramatized internal conflict. There are no contradictory impulses shown in the scene; she proceeds with unbroken, inspired focus. The result is a character who is competent and serves her function in the plot, but lacks the specific, flawed interiority that would make her truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but articulated with diagnostic self-awareness rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The change at the end is precipitated by a summarized letter, making the epiphany feel more told than earned. While her internal state is consistent, the shift from "cautious" to ready relies on an external summary, softening the impact of her final, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The coachman’s motivation is clear but abstract, and his characterization serves the story's theme more than it reveals a complex individual. His interiority is articulate but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; he is a patient vessel for an epiphany. The final change is a conceptual shift rather than a choice born from struggle, making the character feel more symbolic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her internal journey is summarized rather than dramatized. The shift from personal curiosity to community-builder ("Her motivation shifted... She was no longer just seeking answers for herself") is an unearned epiphany, occurring without any internal conflict, doubt, or cost. Her character reads as a placid vehicle for the theme rather than a person experiencing a difficult, meaningful transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but stated too explicitly ("to reflect light into dark corners"). The connection with the lockmaster feels engineered through overly symmetrical dialogue, where he perfectly articulates her inner world. This flattens the characterization, making the final earned moment of connection read more as a thematic statement than a genuine, messy human interaction with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract labels like "brittle determination" rather than embodied emotion or in-scene contradiction. The transformation at the climax feels more like a preordained switch being flipped than a change earned through struggle within the scene itself. While her actions align with her goal, the character's internal journey is summarized more than it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority lacks compelling contradiction. Her journey feels serene and observant rather than driven by a difficult internal struggle. The final change is an earned understanding, but the character reads more as a thoughtful vessel for the theme than a complex individual whose flaws shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on labels ("grit") than on dramatized internal conflict. She is highly competent from the start, and her choices feel correct and rational rather than arising from a difficult, contradictory struggle. The lack of a meaningful flaw that complicates her actions keeps the characterization from achieving top-tier depth, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The character's core motivation and internal conflict are clear and consistent. However, the resolution of her claustrophobia feels more asserted than earned. The line "she embraced the mutiny, allowing it to reshape her fears into strength" summarizes a profound psychological shift rather than embodying it, reading like a diagnostic label at the story's peak emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character concept is strong and her motivation is clear. However, her interiority sometimes relies on diagnostic label-speak, particularly in the moment of epiphany ("she was confronting the very nature of empathy, of connection"). This abstracts the emotional shift rather than embodying it, slightly weakening an otherwise compelling protagonist whose core paradox drives the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. The internal contradiction of "nervously confident" is stated and somewhat embodied through her actions versus the "spongey dread." However, her final choice to "protect" over "restore" feels like an unearned epiphany, as the story doesn't provide enough specific detail about the stakes of that choice to make her resolution feel fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    Bridge-Song's motivation is stated in abstract, grand terms ("to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’") rather than shown through concrete need or internal conflict. We are told they are "dynamically observant," but the key deductions feel like unearned epiphanies, not a process. The character reads more as a vessel for the plot's mysterious concepts than a person with a compelling internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his primary trait, being “perceptively calm,” is more asserted than earned. While it is tested once in the scene with his father's partner, the conflict resolves too easily to reveal any internal contradiction or cost associated with this calmness. The final change feels more like an intellectual summary than a deeply embodied emotional shift, making the "heart at peace" feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal journey is more summarized than embodied. The story relies on labels like "a profound shift within herself" rather than dramatizing the contradictory impulses of that change. While her final choice is earned by the plot, the emotional texture leading to it feels somewhat frictionless and overly self-aware.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively tying her internal flaw (guarded nature) to the external conflict. Her internal contradiction is present, but often stated ("warlike serenity belied the storm within her") rather than fully embodied in contradictory actions or perceptions. The final choice to confess is well-earned, but the transformation into "quiet resolve" feels slightly too swift and tidy for a deeply held trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stock phrases like "heart raced" and "resolve hardening." The core emotional state, "anxious elation," is labeled twice but not deeply embodied through contradictory actions or unique perceptions. She remains a determined archetype without the specific flaws or internal conflicts that create a truly compelling character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently dramatized, from her precise, gentle actions to her final, resolute choice. The internal conflict is effectively externalized in the confrontation with her double. However, the characterization is held back slightly by the dialogue, which occasionally slides into thematic summary rather than character-driven expression, as when the figure states, "meaning is a currency."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in past loss and recent failure. The internal conflict between his analytical shield and emotional ache is well-established. However, the epiphany, while earned, is articulated with a degree of self-aware diagnosis ("insulating himself not with facts, but with hope") that slightly lessens the embodied feel of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eliara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies on labels like "kindly methodical" and "haunted ambitions" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her emotional states are summarized ("a mix of fear and excitement") instead of being embodied with character-particular detail. The final change is earned by the plot, but the internal journey reads more as a tidy progression than a complex struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks friction. The central puzzle is solved without a genuine struggle or a difficult trade-off, leading to an epiphany that feels more stated than earned. Her character reads as a competent professional executing a task rather than a person grappling with contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation shifts from professional duty to mythic purpose with a speed that feels more convenient than earned. The interiority relies on abstractions like "her motivation crystallized" rather than dramatizing the contradictory impulses of her choice. The "heartbeat of a hesitation" is the story's single moment of internal conflict, but it's resolved too quickly to feel like a genuine struggle with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and compellingly tied to the physical objects of her quest. The internal conflict is well-established, particularly the tension between her methodical nature and the raw emotionality she now faces. However, some interiority dips into diagnostic language (“raw ache of unfiltered memory,” “layers of guilt and regret”), which slightly abstracts the emotion rather than fully embodying it in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from the edge of the mist to the desk. The shift from "cautious exuberance" to "resolve" provides a discernible arc. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("heart raced," "fear and hope") and the final emotional state is more declared than fully embodied through a difficult choice or visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization feels like a collection of intriguing traits (researcher, telepath, diviner) rather than a fully integrated person. Her core skills as a "provenance researcher" are never demonstrated; her actions rely entirely on supernatural gifts. The interiority is effective but relies on repeating the "mulberry ache," and phrases like "weigh a dream against an empire" read more like authorial summary than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her climactic change of heart feels more like a passive acceptance of wisdom than an earned internal shift. The transformation from fearing stillness to embracing it is catalyzed by a single sentence from an external agent, making it feel abrupt. While her initial traits are established, the internal conflict between her desire to preserve beauty and her fear of oblivion could have been more actively dramatized before the traveler provided the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but lacks contradiction in-scene. Her defining trait, "kindly decisive," is asserted more than demonstrated under pressure. The epiphany feels given rather than earned, culminating in a diagnostic summary: "she understood now—the pin was not just a relic of her past but a symbol of her journey." This abstracts the internal change rather than embodying it in a difficult final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear but stated rather than dramatized. His character is defined by his profession, but he lacks a compelling internal conflict or a difficult on-page choice; he is a competent functionary who executes his task without struggle. The description of Mara as "sincerely insincere" is a promising contradiction, but since she is off-page, it remains an abstraction. The character reads as a vessel for the story's concept rather than a person experiencing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal conflict often relies on summary rather than embodied action. Phrases like "she felt the weight of her mission" and "fearing the chaos" label the emotion without fully dramatizing it. The memory of her older self is a potent concept but is presented as a static piece of information that shaped her, rather than a dynamic, contradictory impulse acting in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the characterization lacks depth. Interiority is presented through abstract concepts ("stillness," "presence") rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. The "weathered resolve" is stated but not demonstrated through a dramatized struggle, making the final epiphany feel more like a logical conclusion than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but his defining trait as an "underachieving" mage who "often ended in failure" is contradicted when he flawlessly executes the never-before-mastered technique of mist walking at the climax. This disconnect between established character and decisive action makes his success feel unearned. The final epiphany is stated as a generic realization rather than an embodied, character-specific change.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear but evolves from a passive "longing" to an active commitment. The character is more of a vessel for the story's magical discovery than a complex individual with deep internal contradictions. His primary action is to follow and accept, which fits the fable-like tone, but limits the demonstration of complex interiority under pressure. The final choice to make the vow is a solid act of agency that earns the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is consistently presented, but its articulation—"to wavelength align with purpose"—borders on abstract jargon rather than a deeply embodied need. The emotional arc from "quietly enthusiastic" doubt to determined hope is clear and earned by the climax. However, interiority occasionally relies on telling ("Her motivation was clear") instead of consistently showing her state through nuanced action and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her emotional arc from stasis to renewed purpose is legible. However, the story leans on summary for key moments of change, such as the direct statement, “Elara’s motivation burned clear,” which tells the reader of a shift rather than dramatizing the internal process. Interiority is competent but lacks the specific, contradictory texture of a top-tier piece, occasionally feeling over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliard’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his “earnestly naive” belief system. His actions, particularly the patient mending of the bell, align well with his character. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; his devotion is tested by the task's difficulty but never by internal doubt, making his journey feel linear rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a noble archetype than a complex individual; there is no internal conflict, contradiction, or meaningful flaw that complicates his choices. Phrases like "surge of purpose" are told rather than embodied, and the trait "precisely humane" is asserted but never truly tested, making his journey feel emotionally frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her core conflict between logic and intuition is stated rather than dramatized. The key moment of decision—approaching the flame—presents the conflict as a brief, easily-overcome hesitation ("Elara hesitated... but her intuition urged her forward"). A more compelling characterization would have shown these contradictory impulses acting with simultaneous, embodied pressure, making her final transformation feel earned through struggle rather than achieved through a frictionless epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character is a coherent archetype, but their interiority relies heavily on summary and labels (e.g., "attentively inventive mind," "inventive nature clashed with the weight of responsibility"). Motivation is clear but abstract. The story tells us about the character's internal conflict rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses in the scene, which keeps the characterization functional but not deeply compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, but their emotional progression at the climax feels overly summarized and rapid. The line "Fear, anger, sadness, joy—they came in waves, overwhelming yet liberating" is diagnostic label-speak that tells rather than embodies the shift, undercutting the earnedness of the final integration. While the internal conflict is well-staged, the resolution relies on a tidy emotional epiphany rather than a more contradictory, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot. However, the characterization remains archetypal—The Puzzlemaker—with interiority that relies on functional but stock phrasing like "his mind racing" and "heart pounding." The internal conflict is presented as a list of questions rather than a deeply felt, embodied contradiction, preventing the character from achieving a higher degree of specificity or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained. However, his interiority relies heavily on descriptive labels like "mournfully eager" rather than dramatizing the contradiction through conflicting micro-choices. While his actions are potent, the internal experience feels slightly generalized, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation is split between her stated goal ("to make friends with uncertainty") and her embodied one ("dimensionally homesick"). While her final choice aligns with her role as a guardian, the feral trait feels like a label, only briefly shown when she "coiled like a predator." Her interiority is competent but relies on conceptual phrases like "foggy lucidity" rather than consistently specific, embodied emotion, slightly distancing the reader from her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal shift relies on asserted epiphanies ("the penny drop") rather than dramatized struggle. Interiority slips into diagnostic language ("creative destruction," "successive approximation") that feels more like authorial summary than a character's authentic thought process under pressure, flattening her voice at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s character is more of a thematic function than a person with compelling internal contradictions. Her internal struggle is articulated as a simple checklist of "discarding assumptions," which she accomplishes instantly and without cost or resistance. The final realization, "she had found herself," is a tidy summary that feels unearned because no genuine, embodied struggle was dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her primary trait, “resiliently positive,” is a label asserted twice rather than a dramatized, complex aspect of her character. Her response to the transient’s warning feels like a stock heroic line, lacking the internal conflict or embodied emotion of a character facing immense peril. Her actions are consistent with her goal, but her interiority remains generic, preventing the final endurance from feeling deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but her characterization relies heavily on conceptual labels like "fever dream architect" rather than earned traits. The pivotal choice to proceed despite the risk is summarized ("her motivation burned brighter than her fear") rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment, making her feel more like a function of the theme than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and well-rooted in her profession. Her character is revealed through her reaction to the anchor chain and her decisive response to Kael. However, her interiority sometimes uses declarative statements like "fear was a poor compass," which reads more as a thematic summary than an embodied, contradictory internal conflict, slightly flattening the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on stock phrases ("curiosity piqued," "heart quickened") and authorial labels like "incidental heroism." While her actions align with her stated purpose, the characterization lacks the friction of internal conflict or a distinctive perceptual signature. The story shows a competent professional executing her duty rather than a complex individual grappling with a profound experience.

    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict with claustrophobia is more stated than embodied. The resolution ("it no longer controlled her") feels like a diagnostic summary rather than an earned, dramatized shift. Her actions are well-motivated by her debt to Dr. Voss, but the interiority could be more specific and less reliant on labels.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent. The embodiment of anxiety through the constant heartbeat counting provides a concrete internal metric for her arc. However, the final emotional shift from long-held anxiety to serene acceptance feels slightly abrupt and under-dramatized, happening within a single night's work with little sign of the struggle or contradiction that would make the final peace feel more deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. The transformation from storyteller to guardian is earned through on-page struggle and sacrifice. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of generic interiority, such as "her heart filled with a sense of accomplishment," which summarizes emotion rather than embodying it with the same specificity as the story's world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation is clear but executed with more telling than showing. The pivotal emotional shift to laughter, while attempting to fulfill the "cosmic joke" motivation, reads as an abrupt, intellectual decision rather than an earned, embodied emotional turn. The line "she found what she'd been searching for: a cosmic joke" is diagnostic label-speak that summarizes the catharsis instead of letting the moment's absurdity land on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a defiant artist. Her interiority is tangible, particularly in the line "The gap between knowing and understanding was where Elara lived." However, the transition from suspecting the shell is a key to knowing she must synchronize her heartbeat feels like a sudden leap of insight rather than a choice made under compounding pressure, slightly lessening the earned quality of the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, anchored effectively by the backstory of his sister. However, key traits like being "respectfully rebellious" are stated rather than demonstrated through a difficult on-page choice, and some emotional descriptions lean on summary ("his heart heavy with hope and sorrow") rather than fully embodied experience, keeping the characterization just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The carpenter's motivation is stated clearly but remains an abstract concept rather than a felt, internal conflict. His pivotal change—from silence to song—feels compelled by external magic ("a melody he had never heard before, yet it felt as though it had always been a part of him") rather than emerging from a difficult, character-driven choice. While his actions are consistent, the character functions more as a vessel for the plot's magical events than a complex individual whose internal state earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on the label “sanely eccentric” repeated twice, which functions as a summary rather than a dramatized trait with costs. While her core mission drives the plot, her interiority is functional, lacking the specific, contradictory impulses needed for a higher score. The final commitment to guardianship is earned by the events, but the character feels more like a necessary conduit for the concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—to resolve a long-held longing. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels like "cipher of longing" and "runaway dream" rather than specific, embodied contradiction. The final shift to finding "the courage to create it anew" feels more like an asserted epiphany than a change earned through on-page struggle; the contradiction isn't shown acting in the scene, it's summarized and then resolved neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation is clear but her core trait of "unassumingly bold" is merely asserted rather than demonstrated through choices with trade-offs. Her defining internal conflict—overcoming a fear she's held since childhood—is resolved with little on-page struggle. The story states she is "unchanged" by the climax, which flattens any potential for a meaningful character arc and makes her final, steady-voiced decision feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions as a "hands-on folklorist" are well-dramatized when she digs for the locket. However, the interiority relies on stock phrases like "her mind racing" and "heart pounding," which slightly flatten the emotional texture during key moments of discovery, holding it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied through specific actions like trembling fingers and walking backwards. The shift from nervousness to resolve is earned. However, the motivation itself ("to teach the world how to endure without breaking") reads more like an authorial theme statement than a character's specific, grounded goal, slightly abstracting her otherwise concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. There is no internal conflict; she is a singular, idealized figure executing a pre-ordained task. Emotions are asserted ("felt the color of wonder surge through her") rather than embodied, and she reads more as a symbolic vessel for the theme than a complex individual with flaws or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is well-established and consistent, linking her professional task to her personal grief through the potent symbol of her mother's broken mask. Her internal conflict is palpable, particularly in the moment she pauses before the stubborn knot. However, the articulation of her inner state sometimes relies on abstract labels like "lucid unrest" rather than purely embodied experience, which slightly softens the impact of her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, but her characterization relies on telling over showing. Traits like "methodically curious" and "shielded openness" are stated as labels rather than emerging from contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority reads as a summary of a rational process, lacking the embodied, sometimes irrational, texture of a person deeply invested in a mystery; she is a competent functionary of the plot rather than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her analytical nature is well-established. However, the final shift in her understanding is articulated with diagnostic clarity (“The physics of letting go, she realized, wasn’t about understanding death but about embracing the impermanence of everything”), which reads more like an authorial summary than an embodied, in-scene epiphany. This slightly undermines the earned quality of her change, substituting a tidy conclusion for a more complex internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but rests on a stated kinship ("she too had often felt like a ghost") rather than an embodied internal conflict. Her actions demonstrate high competence, but the absence of struggle or a moment of genuine self-doubt makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a complex individual. The final epiphany about her gift is asserted directly, lacking the nuance of an earned, character-driven realization.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal arc feels more asserted than earned. The final transformation from "detachment" to "warmth" is summarized in an epiphany ("she realized the truth... about understanding her own heart") rather than dramatized through a costly choice or struggle. Her primary trait, "warmly inquisitive," is stated but doesn't create internal conflict or lead to a difficult decision; she simply proceeds along a linear path without contradiction or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique professional passion. Her interiority is present, but her final choice to leap feels more driven by the story's conceptual needs than a deeply embodied, contradictory struggle. The character reads as a sincere, capable vessel for the theme, but lacks the internal friction or surprising micro-choices that would elevate her to a truly memorable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the compelling paradox of her "gift, or curse." Her interiority is well-drawn, particularly how her unique perception shapes her world. However, the final internal shift feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on a diagnostic label when she concludes it was "a discovery of her own limits," which slightly lessens the emotional impact of an otherwise earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her defining trait, curiosity, effectively drives the plot. The concept of "sociable isolation" provides a nice emotional anchor. However, her internal conflict remains low-key, and the resolution of her isolation feels more like a fortunate discovery than a choice earned through a difficult trade-off, limiting the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal journey relies on some stock phrasing ("heart pounded," "mind racing"). The pivotal change is legible—from trembling hands to confident ones—but the epiphany is articulated too directly ("The rhythm of repair, she realized..."). This statement feels more like a thematic summary than an earned, embodied insight, slightly undercutting the character's internal work at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The characters are functional archetypes who serve the plot without demonstrating meaningful interiority or conflict. Kael's motivation is stated but not explored, and his allies are defined solely by their skills (botanist, sculptor, musician), which they deploy conveniently. The absence of any internal struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulses makes the collective effort feel pre-ordained and emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent. Her internal conflict between duty and doubt is legible, culminating in the embodied choice to use her own blood—a strong, specific action. The characterization is slightly weakened by the mentor's remembered words, which feel more like a thematic summary than an organic piece of interiority that shifts tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot effectively, shifting from reluctant duty to active purpose. However, the internal change feels slightly rushed, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes her newfound identity with a little too much self-aware clarity. The line "She had found her purpose..." acts as a label, telling us of a change that the preceding images had already successfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characterization is strong and motivation is clear, but Elena’s interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic language ("a process she desperately needed," "she knew she had to atone"). The "symphonically minded" trait feels more like an applied label than an embodied way of perceiving the world, slightly flattening her internal voice. However, her emotional progression from static grief to a readiness for integration feels earned by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives her actions. However, her interiority is more declarative than embodied; we are told of her purpose and quest, but we don't experience much internal conflict or contradictory impulses during the ascent. Her competence is admirable but leaves little room for vulnerability, making the struggle feel purely external rather than a deep personal test.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but abstract, and her internal state is more often labeled than embodied. The description of her resolve as “sturdy brittle” is an authorial assertion that short-circuits the tension of the moment it describes. While her competence is established, the lack of a palpable internal struggle during the final act of subsuming her own remorse makes the concluding change feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but she reads more as a function of the plot than a person with complex interiority. Her competence is absolute, and she lacks any flaw or internal contradiction that would create tension; her success feels preordained. The label "empathetically decisive" is stated rather than dramatized through a choice with a tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on evocative but undramatized labels like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise." While her motivation is clear, her internal conflict is more described than embodied. The final shift to "quiet determination" is earned by the story's accumulative logic, but the contradictions in her character aren't fully tested in scene; her actions read as purposeful and focused, not chaotic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary trait, “prism-minded,” is asserted rather than demonstrated. It functions as a label for competence (“allowing her to see connections others would miss”) without showing a unique or flawed thought process. Her emotions are stated (“fear and excitement”) but lack specific embodiment, making her feel more like a functional protagonist than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent but lacks depth or internal conflict; phrases like "Her motivation was pure" and concepts such as "symphonically minded" are stated as labels rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The characterization is coherent and serves the story's lyrical aims, but it remains one-dimensional, presenting an idealized artist without flaws or meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alara's motivation is clear but stated too directly, reading like an authorial thesis ("driven by a motivation to discover beauty in the difficult"). The internal conflict is summarized rather than shown through contradictory impulses in the scene. The final epiphany—"she felt a surge of clarity"—is presented as a sudden, tidy event rather than a messy, earned struggle, which slightly lessens the impact of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on elegant labels ("eclectic pacifist," "intuitively descriptive") than on embodied, contradictory impulses shown in-scene. The emotional arc is legible but presented with a diagnostic clarity—e.g., "The theatrical sincerity of the moment was not lost on her"—that summarizes rather than immerses. The lack of a genuine flaw or setback makes her success feel predetermined, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her climactic realization feels more like a diagnosis than an embodied, contradictory experience. The shift from "emptiness" to "profound understanding" is sudden and articulated in overly abstract terms ("interconnectedness of all things," "harmony of motion and rest"), lacking the messiness of a genuine internal struggle. This reduces the earned quality of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, making her a functional protagonist. However, her interiority is thin, relying on labels like "she knew" or "she realized" rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. The final epiphany—"not just for the orchard planet, but for herself"—feels like an unearned thematic summary rather than a character-particular, earned change, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but largely asserted through labels like "rapidly adapting mind" rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her emotional state is declared ("Her heart quickened") rather than embodied, making the final weight of her discovery feel slightly unearned. The characterization is functional and consistent, but lacks the particularity and internal conflict required for a top-tier rating.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized. The line "she needed to unfetter her own fears" serves as a label for a struggle that the reader doesn't witness her actively navigate in the present scene, making the resolution feel competent but not deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on summary and diagnostic labels rather than embodied emotion. The decision to play the flute is resolved by a simple declaration that "desire... outweighed her fear," which feels too tidy. The repeated thematic phrase "harvest insights from failure" functions more as an authorial tag than a character-particular thought, flattening her internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his interiority relies too heavily on abstract, authorial concepts like "the mathematics of emotion." The moment of change is articulated with diagnostic clarity ("He understood now that empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them"), reading as a summary rather than an earned, embodied epiphany emerging from the chaos he supposedly endured.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's characterization is compelling, with a well-realized internal conflict between duty-bound anxiety and a nascent longing for purpose. Her emotional state is consistently embodied through her physical interactions with the pendant and the environment. The final shift from a jittery courier to a chosen carrier is earned by the story's accumulated pressure, fulfilling the 9+ test with a choice that carries the visible cost of a surrendered, familiar life.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her emotional progression from clinical investigator to humbled empath is earned by the story's climax. The interiority is concrete, especially the moment her "heart aching with the weight of it." However, the character reads more as a functionary for the concept than a deeply conflicted individual; her final realization feels slightly too articulated, bordering on self-aware diagnosis rather than a raw, embodied shift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent with her wistful nature, culminating in a decisive final action. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction; the "weight of her sacrifice" is stated more than it is embodied as a genuine internal conflict prior to the final paragraph. The character serves the mythic concept beautifully but remains more of an archetype than a deeply particularized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal transformation from “meek” to “defiant” is asserted more than it is dramatized. The internal conflict around the trade is muted because the central concept of his “awakening” remains abstract, lessening the weight of his choice. The final emotional state is described as being “caught between understanding and confusion,” a label that summarizes his change rather than embodying it through specific perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated but remains abstract, lacking the specific personal history needed to ground her quest. Her transformation from map maker to guardian is an unearned epiphany delivered by an external agent, rather than a change forged through internal conflict or difficult choices. The final acceptance feels frictionless, missing the embodied sense of cost that would make the "weight of her responsibility" palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is established with a consistent trait ("reticent," "warmly observant") and a resonant habit (collecting sea glass). However, his internal transformation feels more asserted than earned. The shift from a man with a vague "luminescent ache" to a resolved guardian happens too quickly and cleanly, culminating in an epiphany that reads like a diagnostic summary rather than a struggled-for realization.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The Herald's motivation is clear and consistent, but their characterization relies on telling over showing. Interiority is conveyed through emotional labels ("Panic flickered," "curiosity," "awe") rather than embodied experience, making the rapid shifts feel more like plot functions than authentic reactions. The "laughing" trait is a consistent motif, but the character as a whole lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a truly memorable protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on labels like "quietly explosive" rather than embodied contradiction. The primary weakness is the dialogue, where both characters slip into over-articulated, diagnostic self-awareness. The woman’s line, “I’ve been carrying his story ever since, not sure if I should let it go or hold on tighter,” reads more like a thematic summary than authentic speech in a moment of vulnerability with a stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear but highly abstract (“to discover what trees witness”), and he functions more as a thoughtful observer than a character with deep internal conflict. His actions are competent and direct, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses or flaws that would complicate his choices. The final realization feels more like a graceful reception of the theme than a change earned through personal struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core flaw as a “scattered memory keeper” provides a functional internal obstacle. However, her interiority relies on somewhat standard emotional descriptors (“hands trembled,” “motivation burned brighter”) rather than a more particular, embodied experience. The climactic struggle against her own nature is stated more than dramatized as a contradictory impulse in the moment, making her final shift feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her core traits feel more like labels than embodied qualities. Her "compassionate" and "keenly empathetic" nature is stated but doesn't force a difficult choice or create a contradictory impulse in-scene. The final decision to "hide no more" is a logical conclusion to her intellectual journey, but the emotional shift reads as a summary ("With a heart full of resolve") rather than a complex, earned internal change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with it. However, her interiority sometimes relies on abstract, narrator-driven labels like "creeping normality noticer" and "heuristically gentle," which feel more like authorial summaries than a character's internal voice. While consistent, she lacks a compelling internal contradiction; her path is one of serene purpose, which limits the depth of her characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her transformation is earned. The central conflict between her "gently meticulous" nature and "newfound urgency" is well-established. However, the story occasionally labels this internal conflict—"her gently meticulous nature now clashed with a newfound urgency"—rather than fully embodying it through action or sensory detail in that specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her upbringing. Her interiority, particularly the "comforting unease," is specific and effective. However, her climactic confrontation relies on slightly generic tough-talk ("tonight, I’m rewriting them"), and her competence feels a bit frictionless, lacking a moment of genuine struggle or a visible trade-off that would elevate the characterization from strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's core internal conflict as a "luminous skeptic" is established but resolves too quickly and with minimal struggle. Her skepticism is stated to be at war with her curiosity, but it capitulates almost instantly upon hearing the mysterious figure's exposition. A truly sharp-minded skeptic would likely require more than a single cryptic conversation to abandon her entire rational framework, making her final choice feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and potent, and her internal conflict is well-defined. The character is slightly undermined by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as identifying herself as "a woman trapped by her own fear." The final emotional state is described with the label "auroral sorrow" rather than fully embodied, which keeps this strong portrayal from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving her from a state of quiet desperation to one of determined hope. Her unique gift is well-integrated, creating a compelling internal conflict when the truth she seeks proves to be tainted. The final change is earned, though the epiphany ("She understood now that the oasis had not dried by accident...") is slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her meticulous actions. Her interiority is palpable, especially the final sense of peace, which feels earned by her creative act. However, the characterization lacks a significant internal contradiction demonstrated in-scene; she is presented as a wholly dedicated artist without visible struggle or conflicting impulses, which keeps it from the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot. However, her internal conflict is more stated than embodied. Phrases like "fragmented wholeness" and "torn between duty and desire" act as diagnostic labels rather than showing contradictory impulses through action, particularly during the climax where the struggle feels more external than internal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara’s motivation begins as simple curiosity, a believable trait for her profession, but her final epiphany feels unearned. The shift from "uncovering stories" to finding a "purpose" in healing is asserted rather than dramatized. Mrs. Ellis functions more as an archetypal "wise elder" delivering exposition than a character with her own agency, making their interaction feel like a plot mechanism rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is stated directly (“to encrypt vulnerability as strength”) rather than embodied in contradictory choices, making her feel more like a thematic vessel than a person. Her defining trait, “calm defiance,” is a label that doesn't face a significant test, resulting in a competent but emotionally flat protagonist. Her interiority is summarized with phrases like "a surge of triumph," lacking the specific, character-particular texture of a high-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli's motivation is clear and personal, driving the entire narrative. The interiority is functional, establishing his desperation and hope. However, his defining trait as a "lantern lighter" feels more symbolic ("sought not just light but clarity") than integrated into his actions or choices within the chamber, making it feel slightly ornamental. The final emotional state of smiling "with understanding" is a bit too neat, lacking the contradictory or layered emotion expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks significant internal conflict. She is presented as highly competent and determined, with her struggle being purely external against the prophecy's power. The story describes her determination with phrases like "tranquil blaze," but we don't feel the contradictory impulses or the specific, personal cost of this immense focus, which keeps her slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation shifts credibly from caution to curiosity to resolve, though the final step feels slightly accelerated. Her interiority is effective, particularly the "twinge of shame" that grounds the mystical conversation in a relatable social reality. Elias functions well as an enigmatic catalyst whose characterization serves the plot, but Clara's internal conflict could have been dramatized with more contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation begins as a plausible mix of skepticism and curiosity, but her internal conflict resolves too quickly to feel earned. The character arc relies heavily on the spectral figure's direct explanation rather than dramatized struggle. The line "Your isolation has made you strong, and now it’s time to turn that strength into independence" is diagnostic label-speak that summarizes her arc instead of letting her embody it, which feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is present, particularly in her hesitation before acting. However, the emotional progression feels slightly too neat. The realization "To unlink the words was to unlink the hurt" borders on diagnostic self-awareness, and the resolution of her long-held bitterness happens with a swiftness that slightly undermines the depth of the initial pain.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her interiority is conveyed through abstract, ornate labels like "richly perceptive" and "reed-blown melancholy" rather than embodied emotion. Her ultimate transformation from sorrow to resolve feels more like a declared outcome of receiving information than an earned emotional shift resulting from a difficult choice or struggle. Her agency is limited to agreeing to receive the truth, which weakens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on familiar phrasing like "a tapestry woven from the fragments of others’ stories." While her competence is well-established, the character lacks a compelling internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she is a vessel for the story's discovery process rather than a character transformed by it. Her emotional state is fitting but not deeply textured.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but static. She is a vessel for a philosophical idea rather than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure. The characterization relies on evocative labels ("net-mender philosopher," "scintillatingly somber") that are asserted rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or embodied emotional shifts. Her internal journey is a smooth, linear progression toward an epiphany without the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character's motivation is clear but stated rather than embodied. Elara reads as a competent plot functionary whose defining trait, being "sharply observant," is asserted as a label multiple times instead of being demonstrated through a unique perceptual style. Her decision to contain rather than destroy the stillpoint is logical, but lacks the weight of internal conflict, as the "inhabitants" she saves are never seen or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("His eyes, though weary, gleamed with a determination") and asserted emotions ("trembling with anticipation"). The character arc from weary visionary to burdened prophet is earned, but the internal conflict could be dramatized with more contradictory impulses in-scene rather than summarized sacrifices. The final "bittersweet expression" lands well, showing a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored well by the brief reflection on his grandmother. The internal conflict is evident in his struggle with the silent music box. The final shift in his self-perception is earned, but the line "he was a keeper of memories, a translator of souls" borders on diagnostic summary, slightly abstracting the otherwise well-embodied climax.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation as a guardian is clear and drives the plot. However, the core internal conflict, described by the label "logically emotional," is asserted rather than dramatized effectively. Her pivotal decision to trust the key's glow over the visions feels less like a synthesis of logic and emotion and more like a reaction to a magical event, making her internal process slightly shallow at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara’s motivation is stated but not dramatized. Her internal conflict is described as a completed journey ("she began to unyoke herself") rather than shown as a present-tense struggle with contradictory impulses. Characterization relies on abstract labels like "vigilant" and "softly purposeful" instead of earned traits revealed through difficult micro-choices. The result is a character who functions as a fable's archetype rather than a specific, flawed individual.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her characterization relies on established archetypes. The internal conflict regarding her mentor is mostly summarized in reflection rather than dramatized through on-page contradictory actions. The final shift to becoming a "force" feels slightly unearned by the preceding discoveries, reading more like a declaration than an organic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal shift from doubt to resolve is well-executed within the scene. Alistair serves effectively as a wise artisan catalyst, a functional archetype for this story's length. The characterization is strong, though Elias’s interiority occasionally relies on slightly familiar phrasing like “relief washing over him,” which keeps it from the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively anchored by the hunter's arrow tip, which serves as a potent symbol of her defiance and drive. Her interiority is generally well-handled, though some traits like "steadily curious mind" are stated more than dramatized. The final beat, where she clutches the arrow tip with an "irreverent grin," provides a strong character-based closure, showing her embrace of the chaotic consequences she has unleashed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her key attribute, “brightly attentive,” is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The decision to lie marks a solid turning point. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing like “heart raced” and “mind kicked into overdrive,” which slightly flattens the emotional experience at key moments of discovery and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, reading more like a thesis ("to map empathy onto action") than a felt need. Her internal conflict is summarized in a single sentence ("She saw her own fears, her doubts...") without any embodied struggle or contradictory impulse shown on the page. The final change—"a merging of her shadow-laced nature with the courage of the anomaly"—is asserted, not earned through on-page choices, making her arc feel theoretical and distant.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly, and her internal conflict between morbid curiosity and a search for solace is well-drawn. Her interiority is specific, though it occasionally veers toward over-articulation, as when her motivation is stated directly after being shown. The change at the end is earned through the accumulative weight of her encounters, particularly the brief but pivotal conversation with the man, which makes her abstract quest concrete and shared.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and consistent. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract summaries ("too practical for dreamers, too passionate for pragmatists") rather than fully embodied emotion. The final change is earned, but the internal contradictions could have been dramatized with more simultaneous, conflicting impulses in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization remains surface-level. The trait "strangely honest" is stated but never tested in a meaningful choice, rendering it a label rather than an active constraint. Her interiority relies on generalized emotional summaries ("deep sense of fulfillment," "ached with the knowledge") rather than specific, embodied sensations, which keeps the reader at a distance from her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is well-defined and personal, providing a solid foundation for her actions. However, her core traits like being "perceptively calm" are asserted by the narrator rather than demonstrated through her choices under pressure. The interiority feels summarized, relying on labels like "earnest whimsy" instead of showing these qualities through a specific, contradictory internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is singular and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The interiority is well-handled, particularly the final moment of "triumph and sorrow," which provides a complex, earned emotional resolution. The character's reticence is given a meaningful explanation ("a deep respect for the power of language") rather than being a simple trait. His actions, like humming into the crystal, are specific, character-driven choices that reveal his unorthodox and intuitive nature.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, but the execution of his unique traits feels slightly underdeveloped. The concept of being "precognitively forgetful" is fascinating yet functions more as a label than a demonstrated constraint that forces difficult choices. While his internal state is well-rendered, a few key emotional moments rely on stock phrasing like "a forest of unspoken regrets," which slightly dilutes the character's particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “harness the ephemeral” is clear and consistent with her profession as a sage repairer. However, her internal journey feels more like solving a technical puzzle than navigating a deep internal conflict. The pivotal epiphany, while thematically resonant, arrives as a sudden insight rather than a choice earned through struggle, making the final emotional state of "fulfillment" feel slightly unearned and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of internal conflict or struggle. Her competence is absolute ("knew exactly what each patient needed," "flawless goodbye"), making her feel more like a plot device for delivering a positive outcome than a person with contradictory impulses. The story misses the opportunity to show her navigating ambiguity or failure, which would have made her kindness and decisiveness feel more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her "quietly deliberate" trait. However, her interiority lacks texture; there is little sense of internal conflict or struggle. The process of remembering her mentor's teachings feels more like a procedural step than an emotional or difficult trial, making her a competent but emotionally distant protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on abstract labels like “forgiving skeptic” and “shrewdly innocent nature” rather than demonstrating these contradictory traits through action. The late introduction of her friend's "substitute body" makes the core guilt feel asserted rather than deeply embodied from the start. Her final choice to sacrifice the stone is a strong, concrete action that lands well, but the interiority leading to it is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's motivation is well-defined and consistent, effectively tying her craft to her past trauma. The interiority is functional, but it occasionally slips into summary and diagnostic self-awareness, particularly at the end. The sentence, "The memories that had resurfaced... no longer felt like burdens," offers a tidy emotional resolution that slightly undermines the complexity of the preceding struggle by telling instead of showing the peace she's earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied through her connection to the setting and the pendant. The shift from guardedness to tentative connection is earned. However, her interiority occasionally leans on summary ("watchful dreamer," "graft new meaning") instead of fully dramatizing her contradictory impulses in the moment with Kai.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict drives the narrative arc effectively. However, her interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels ("conflicted nature warred within her") and stock emotional reactions ("heart ached") rather than fully embodied, specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization as a "whimsical tinkerer" is undermined by the resolution, which relies on innate magical memory rather than ingenuity or craft. The internal conflict is minimal; her determination faces no significant test or moment of doubt, leading to a smooth, competent success rather than an earned struggle. The emotional progression is a simple, linear ascent to hope, lacking the contradictory impulses of a truly high-stakes internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, driving the entire scene. Her core trait of patience is consistently demonstrated, though its explicit labeling ("a physical demonstration of her patience") is slightly redundant. The characterization is strong in its focus but lacks significant internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle; her success feels assured from the outset, which limits the depth of her portrayal under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, providing a strong anchor for the story. His actions align perfectly with his stated traits as a "reflective locksmith." However, the characterization lacks a deeper layer of internal conflict; his struggle is one of patient endurance rather than a battle with contradictory impulses, which keeps the portrayal from achieving the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is established, but the pivotal change from steadfastly defending her purpose to embracing a new one feels slightly abrupt. The "crack" in her soul is a good embodied beat, yet the final decision could have been foreshadowed with a bit more internal contradiction earlier in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, and her final shift feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic language, such as when "she wondered if she could apply the same principle to her grief." This slightly undermines the otherwise strong embodiment of her struggle by telling the reader the emotional calculus directly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the climactic insight is delivered via a slightly too-articulate, diagnostic message from the camera wheel. The line, "The ghost you’re negotiating with isn’t your enemy. It’s your guide," borders on therapy-speak, slightly undercutting the earned struggle by externalizing the epiphany instead of having it arise from a more ambiguous internal synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The character's motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is an abstract thematic statement rather than a grounded, personal need. Eli acts as a functional vessel for the story's concept without demonstrating meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His "functionally creative" trait is asserted but not tested; his success feels frictionless, revealing little about his character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between duty and desire is well-established. The change feels earned through the symbolic act of finishing the clock. However, the interiority occasionally relies on telling with phrases like "the emptiness she felt," and the emotional resolution feels slightly compressed for a lifetime of longing, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is explicitly stated and consistent, but her interiority relies on stock phrasing like "felt it in her bones" and a "heart that ached." While her actions align with her goals, there is no on-page internal conflict or contradiction; she proceeds with a high degree of competence and little visible struggle. The character reads as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a complex individual with blind spots or contradictory impulses acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear but lacks internal contradiction. She is presented as a flawless, "infinitely patient" archetype whose primary function is to embody the story's theme. The characterization is consistent but thin; there is no moment of doubt, frustration, or a choice between competing values that would reveal a deeper, more complex interiority. Her success feels preordained rather than earned through a struggle that tests her defining traits.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The traveler's motivation is poetically articulated but remains somewhat abstract, functioning more as a thematic frame than a pressurized, personal need. While her actions are consistent, her interiority lacks significant contradiction or flaw, making her feel more like a wise archetype than a complex individual. The elderly woman serves her purpose effectively, but the traveler's transformation feels asserted in the final paragraph rather than earned through a visible struggle or shift in her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and drives the plot. The internal conflict between his goal (restoring nature) and his method (using a machine) creates a compelling tension. However, his final emotional shift relies on an epiphany delivered by the machine, which feels slightly sudden. Some interiority, like "his mind, sharp yet haunted," is more of a label than an embodied experience, slightly flattening the character's depth at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized through contradictory in-scene actions. The central motive, "to prove that scars can sing," is articulated with a diagnostic clarity that slightly lessens its emotional impact, feeling more like a thesis statement than a desperate internal drive. The final shift to peace is earned within the story's symbolic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's characterization as a "luminous skeptic" is an intriguing premise, but her skepticism offers little active resistance. Her transition from defiant hush to curiosity happens too quickly, and the internal conflict feels summarized rather than dramatized, as when the box is said to be "testing her." The final transformation into a "liberator" is more of a declared outcome of the magical event than a choice earned through a difficult internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on abstract labels like "otherworldly sentimentalist" rather than embodied emotion or internal contradiction. Her struggle is a conceptual puzzle, and the resolution feels like an intellectual discovery, not a change born from a visceral, contradictory internal state. The character reads as a vessel for the theme rather than a flawed individual grappling with it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal journey is compelling. The central conflict between carving a static "shape" and honoring a dynamic "space" is well-realized. However, some interiority dips into summary rather than embodied experience, as when she thinks about seeking to "understand its contours," which reads more like an authorial thesis statement than a character's specific, in-the-moment thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation shifts from a personally-rooted diligence to a communal mission, but the transition is abrupt and lacks sufficient grounding. The epiphany feels more asserted than earned, relying on a sudden realization rather than a dramatized internal struggle. The backstory concerning his father is stated but never meaningfully influences his on-page choices, functioning more as a label than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority is rendered in abstract, summary-like terms. Phrases like "a map of sorts, though it seemed to chart emotions" and realizing it was a "key to understanding the intentions" tell the reader the conclusion without dramatizing the process of discovery or any internal struggle. The character is a functional, sensitive archetype, but lacks the specific, contradictory impulses under pressure that would elevate him.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist, Ignorance, serves more as a vessel for the plot than a character with compelling internal conflict. His motivation is clear but his transition from a data-driven cartographer to a conduit for magic is frictionless. The key moment lacks a sense of personal struggle; his contradictory impulses are stated ("trembled...from the weight of possibility") but not dramatized in a meaningful choice, as the magical quill ultimately makes the decision for him.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and well-established. Her actions directly follow from her stated desire to resurrect stories, creating a believable response to the inciting incident. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; her journey is a linear progression from diligence to excitement to resolve, without the contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs that create truly memorable character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes reads as thematic summary rather than embodied thought. Phrases like "She had always been one to weave truth carefully..." feel like an authorial label for a trait, not a character-particular reflection in a moment of tension. While her actions are aligned with her goals, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting in the scene, presenting instead a serene, philosophical state that lessens the feeling of a high-stakes personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear, but his character is defined more by labels ("wannabe philosopher," "rationally rebellious") than by embodied choices. His final change is presented as a summary ("Kael realized...") rather than an earned, visceral shift. The dialogue is stiff, serving the theme more than credible interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on elegant labels ("harmonious," "expectantly resigned") than on embodied, contradictory impulses within the scene. The internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized. Her shift from resignation to action is the story's engine, but the interiority remains somewhat polished and lacks the friction of a genuine struggle against her own despair.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict resolves with a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("maybe it was about her own growth") that feels more like an authorial summary than an organic character realization. While her actions are well-aligned with her goals, the central emotional journey lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied struggle expected in top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("preserve wonder in routine") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Her defining trait, "involuntarily truthful," is a label that is never tested on-page, as she has no one to lie to, thus creating no friction or cost. The character's internal state is functional, but relies on stock phrasing like "her heart raced," lacking a particularized interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, providing a solid through-line. However, his characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like “creeping normality noticer” and “inadvertently profound,” which feel asserted by the narrator rather than earned through contradictory choices in the scene. The internal state is described with poetic elegance but lacks the friction of embodied emotion; he is more of a thoughtful vessel for the story's concept than a character with compelling internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Characterization is competent but relies more on telling than showing. Liora’s internal state is described with abstract labels (“tapestry of whispers,” “incisively kind understanding”) rather than a unique, embodied perception. Elara's shift from absolute certainty to doubt is the core of the story, but the internal conflict feels summarized rather than experienced in a contradictory, moment-to-moment way.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on some telling over showing. The trait "balancedly daring" is an un-dramatized label, and the climactic realization is articulated with a diagnostic clarity ("She realized...") that slightly undermines the emotional embodiment of the moment, reading more like a summary of a change than the change itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is clear, but her core motivation is bifurcated. The initial struggle with insomnia provides a solid, embodied foundation, but the introduction of a past motivation—"to prove that strangers remember kindness"—feels asserted rather than dramatized. This theme is then superseded by the mystical quest, leaving the "kindness" motivation feeling like an unintegrated artifact that doesn't fuel the climactic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of meaningful internal conflict or flaw; she is a competent figure who succeeds without struggle or compromise. Emotions are labeled ("rosewater dread") rather than embodied, and her path to success is linear, missing the contradictory impulses that create a truly compelling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his established character as a "counter-clockwise clock maker." The emotion of "bleak exhilaration" is a specific and well-earned interior state. The character's actions are driven by his core traits, particularly his "neatly inventive mind." The story stops just short of the highest tier because the internal conflict, while present, is more sequential (determination, then unease) than a simultaneous, contradictory pressure in the key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s motivation to overcome fear is clear, but her internal state relies on broad declarations rather than specific, contradictory impulses shown in-scene. The advisor character devolves into a mouthpiece for the theme in the final lines, as in "Fear is a paradox, Clara...". This flattens the character interaction and reads as unearned authorial summary rather than earned character insight.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Leeward’s motivation is explicit and consistent, driving the story's single action. However, his interiority remains somewhat abstract, articulated through philosophical concepts ("sketched resonance") rather than deeply embodied or contradictory impulses. The resolution of his "restlessness" feels more like a successful application of a known formula than a choice made under pressure with ambiguous outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively established by her mentor's disappearance and her "quietly driven" nature. Her actions align perfectly with her goals. The characterization is strong, but the interiority relies on some functional but not highly particular phrases like "her heart pounding" and "her resolve unshaken," which slightly soften the embodiment of her emotional state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly, but her defining trait, "emotionally rational," is stated rather than dramatized. The story asserts this quality but never places her in a situation where her emotions and rationality are in genuine conflict. Her final realization about the "humanity behind" the lies feels more like an unearned thematic summary than a hard-won change resulting from an internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal arc from surveyor to "keeper" is the story's engine. The change is earned through his actions. However, his interiority occasionally slips into thematic summary, as when he thinks, “Interlaced absence was the core concept here,” which reads more like an author's note than a character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on descriptive labels like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. While her actions logically follow from her goal, her character reads as more of a highly competent vessel for the plot than a person with compelling internal friction. The final shift to "profound sense of purpose" feels more like a summary of change than an earned, embodied transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation to escape grief through his craft is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is well-established, and his final shift from suppressing sorrow to honoring it represents an earned change. However, the epiphany ("The realization struck him like a wave") uses cliché phrasing that slightly undercuts the moment's uniqueness, and Lira's dialogue borders on providing a diagnostic label for Kael's emotional state rather than letting him arrive there entirely on his own.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels ("internal geometries a mirror to the chaos in her mind") rather than fully embodied emotion. The final shift to "seeker" is a clear change, but feels more like an intellectual conclusion than a visceral, contradictory process earned through on-page struggle. The character's journey is coherent but lacks the messy, particular texture of a genuine psychological breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s characterization relies heavily on two repeated labels: “sharp-eyed” and “perpetually surprised.” While his skill is demonstrated, the surprise feels ornamental and does not create internal conflict or constrain his actions. The final shift to “quiet resolve” is a clear change, but the preceding interiority is too sparse to make this transformation feel fully earned, reading more like a narrative requirement than a psychological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-dramatized through his interaction with the setting and the watch hand. The shift from seeking to "quell" his guilt to accepting its weight is earned. However, the interiority occasionally relies on stock phrasing ("gnawing at him like a relentless tide"), and the self-aware observation, "The metaphor wasn’t lost on him," momentarily flattens the voice by telling instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her methods are consistent with her thoughtful nature. However, her interiority occasionally relies on labels like "her uncommonly thoughtful nature shining through" instead of purely embodied action. General Kael serves as an effective foil, but his shift from "unyielding" to acquiescence feels slightly abrupt, earned more by the story's thematic momentum than a visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes relies on direct summary ("The backlash of regrets still lingered, but it no longer defined her") rather than embodied experience. The core internal conflict is well-established, though its resolution feels slightly over-articulated. The character change is earned, yet the prose occasionally veers into diagnostic self-awareness that softens the moment's raw emotionality.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is established, but the final epiphany feels more stated than earned. The realization is an intellectual leap rather than an embodied struggle within the scene. The final beat borders on diagnostic self-awareness ("Empathy wasn’t something to kindle; it was something to carry"), which slightly flattens the complexity of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal transformation feels more asserted than earned. The leap from a heart that "ached at the thought" of letting go to a smiling acceptance is too swift and lacks the friction of a genuine internal conflict. The character arc is legible but lacks the specific, contradictory embodiment needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is lucid and compelling, rooted in a specific, emotionally resonant backstory. Her internal conflict between duty and family is clear, and the final shift toward presence is earned within the story's symbolic logic. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments where emotion is stated rather than fully embodied, such as feeling the "weight of her absence like a stone in her chest," a common but not particularly specific simile.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority tends toward abstract labels (“gravity of sorrow”) and overly articulate self-analysis. The pivotal realization—"that shadow work was not just about confronting darkness—it was about transforming it into something beautiful"—reads as a thematic summary rather than an embodied, contradictory struggle earned in the moment. Her pacifism is a static trait, never truly tested by a tempting or seemingly necessary alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but abstract, and her pivotal epiphany feels delivered rather than earned through significant internal conflict. The realization that she is "becoming the prophecy itself" is stated as a summary, functioning more like a diagnostic label than an embodied, contradictory emotional experience. Her initial reluctance to the detour is quickly resolved, softening the pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her final choice is well-supported, but her interiority relies on labels rather than embodied experience. Phrases like "calmly inventive mind" and "vigilant nature kicked in" tell the reader her traits instead of showing them through contradictory impulses under pressure. The characterization is functionally sound but lacks the specific, textured depth required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is singular and clear, driving the story’s action effectively. However, his interiority leans toward summary, especially during the climactic epiphany ("In that instant, Kael understood"). The characterization feels functional rather than deeply specific, with moments like his "rare expression on his weathered face" verging on cliché and preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority relies on summary and labels at the moment of transformation. The phrase "all dissolving into a singular clarity" is an unearned epiphany, telling us about a complex emotional process rather than embodying it. The character arc is credible, but the final emotional state feels too tidy for the preceding weight of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, and his “diplomatically fierce” nature is demonstrated effectively when he presses his advantage. Mara is a functional foil. The final shift from seeking answers to embracing questions is a significant change, but it feels slightly more like an intellectual thesis statement than a deeply embodied, costly personal transformation for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias's motivation is clear but his most interesting trait—molting personalities—is introduced only to be conveniently resolved by the end ("he felt a permanence").

    Elara’s interiority is specific—her glass-maker’s patience, her need “to discover purpose in the pauses”—but the apprentice’s absence is only asserted, not felt. The ledger strip is handled twice (discovery, final reveal) yet never alters her tactics in-scene; she simply follows its trail. The “steadily adaptive” trait is stated rather than embodied in a visible trade-off. Closure cost is present (apprentice captive, workshop lost) but arrives off-stage, muting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, the tuning fork against her lips—but the contradiction between despair and hope is stated more than dramatized in scene. Kael’s arrival supplies relational pressure, yet their silent exchange is sketched rather than crucible-tested. The final renunciation (silence as canvas) is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s weary persistence and stubbornness are embodied in his tactile search for lens fragments; the final choice to hold the beacon aloft is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (his exhaustion lifts, the city’s voice is released). Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“second skin,” “quiet urgency”) dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—quiet service toward collective intergenerational survival—defines every beat; her anonymous food runs and bell-announced gathering both reveal iron consistency and the cost of exposed identity. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of her secret suddenly lighter”), though emotion tends stated rather than embodied. No contradiction or drift, yet the arc stops short of an earned flaw; the climax merely extends her existing ethic rather than challenging it.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, slowed breath—but the past-life priestess backstory is delivered in one dense block rather than interleaved micro-choices, muting the contradiction that should drive her. The final “ready to heal the world” turn feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with “texture of time” is stated more than embodied; her trembling hand and the warmth of the fragment gesture toward embodied emotion, but interiority drifts into abstraction. The final shift—“she had discovered herself”—is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost. Still, her micro-choice to place the fragment on the pedestal is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid—"eyes burned with a purpose that defied captivity," chains as both burden and crucible—but reliance on heroic archetype dilutes flaw; choice to descend and renounce extra jars feels more dutiful than frictive, so contradictions flatten rather than clash. Emotional specificity slips into lyrical summary rather than embodied panic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic hearing aid, the tactile memory of trust breaking—but the final renunciation (“not something to be feared, but understood”) is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. The contradiction between her obsessive quest and sudden acceptance is stated, not embodied in a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart ached”), but the decisive choice—accepting the jar—leans on Elara’s validation rather than a fully dramatized internal contradiction; the cost is felt yet not foreclosed by prior causality alone.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her fear of vulnerability versus her need to create safe zones is embodied in the glasswork—but the “abandon” beat is more declared than dramatized; the bookmark’s final placement feels symbolic rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Internal contradiction (fear vs. drive) is voiced, not dramatized; agency flares only in the final gesture with seashell. Micro-choices remain abstract—“trembling certainty” labels the state rather than embodying it—so the final renunciation costs remain legible but thinner than required for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s obsession is clear and embodied in tactile ritual, but interior contradiction remains abstract; no moment shows the cost of this obsession altering tactics. The final smile registers as performance rather than earned renunciation, softening the sting of “work far from over.”

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit-7’s interiority is cleanly rendered through sensorial micro-choices (cradling the violin, pausing at vibration), but the shift from “mere maintenance” to “seeker” is asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory beats; the final calm is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. need for transparency) play out in micro-choices like tracing the ticket and sketching her own doodles. The final gesture—sliding the folded paper and lens—earns the thaw of mistrust with visible relational cost. Secondary pressure from Kian is minimal until the last beat, but the single on-page relationship shift is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied (gnarled hands, deliberate polishing), but the “wisely pragmatic” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “icy warmth” layering reckless obsession beneath composure plays in every micro-choice; the final manual lever correction is an earned renunciation that balances her flaw against the station’s survival, the cost of partial success showing on the humming nexus and the wing-light outside.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clara’s obsession with gaps and in-between spaces gives her interiority a sharp specificity—felt every time she runs fingertips across the disintegrating paper.  The contradictory pull between her longing for music and her real fear of the ruin is on the page in her hesitation “water sloshing around her ankles.”  Her final humming-summons earns its poignancy because earlier beats establish the cost: letting the program dissolve means accepting the ghost’s closure rather than keeping it as talisman.  Still, it leans on a lightly romanticised “mystery pulls her” motive and could expose the rawer contradiction with more grit.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara projects contradictory impulses (holds unbearable truth versus absorbing all) and is shaped through micro-choices (finger smudge that redefines the illustration). Interiority is embodied and specific; the oracle’s passivity is precise—she endures rather than resolves, a credible renunciation earned by prior evidence and landing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s skepticism and filial guilt are sketched early, but interiority stays summary-level (“restless need,” “weight of her father’s swallowed truth”) rather than embodied contradiction. The valve wheel becomes a prop of decision, yet her turn lacks a visible cost or flaw-driven hesitation. The shift from doubt to belief is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Closure is achieved, but the emotional price feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interiority is evocative but abstract; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. enter the refuge) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final “she had become the silence” is a tidy epiphany that feels earned by the journey yet lacks embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is gentle and consistent, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the curl’s glow and Finn’s wonder are the only visible cost. Motivation (nurture wonder) is stated rather than dramatized through a hard choice. The link with Finn shifts his stance, yet Elara’s own arc feels more observational than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “odd historian” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; interiority drifts into exposition (“she had always believed…”) instead of embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows her oddness costing her anything; the ritual succeeds because she is sensitively perceptive, not despite a flaw. The ending smile feels unearned because prior beats lack internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Li Wei’s interiority is evocative (“felt an sudden surge of clarity”) but remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The shift from writer to “conductor of fate” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost of the new identity is not yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The priest’s interiority is abstract and oracular rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. Motivation (“illuminate hidden assumptions”) is stated repeatedly but never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything. The final declaration lands as authorial summation, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “chronologically homesick” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choice. The final collapse carries felt cost yet motivation for “unheard symphonies” stays atmospheric, not causally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“darkening brightness” and the tablet’s pulse anchor contradictory impulses—but the self-encounters remain symbolic tableaux rather than crucibles that force new micro-choices; the final smile feels more bestowed than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction and embodied choices (tracing broken needle→rigging reverse recorder) drive each step until the tear that charges the final stance. Motives intensify smoothly across beats. Cost is visible: she relinquishes numbness for raw ache—legible on the tear line. Some emotional shorthand “filament of hush” flirts with label-speak yet the embodied outcome holds it back.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s solitude-versus-duty conflict is sketched but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; the pivot from “integrity in solitude” to “integrity demands action” is asserted rather than dramatized. His interiority is generic (“his mind raced,” “his resolve hardening”) and the masked figure supplies exposition instead of applying relational pressure. The final stance crystallizes, but the cost is only gestured at, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s aromatic caution and bottled grief are embodied in micro-choices (refusing strong scents, finally uncorking the vial). Interior contradiction is present yet not fully simultaneous; the shift to acceptance feels slightly epiphanic rather than wrested under live pressure. Cost is felt—he forecloses his long avoidance—but the sister’s dialogue is more remembered than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction – thirst for temporal knowledge vs. instinct for self-preservation – acts live in every tactile beat (rope-scrape, mirror-touch). The final renunciation (leaving the rope) is earned by accumulating dread shown in the shifting mirage versions of himself; cost is embodied not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused fingers itch, the bowl’s warmth pulses—but her contradictory impulses (fear of the hush vs. need to fill it) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to speak is credible yet feels lightly earned; the cost is poetic rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with minor under-dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “affectionate detachment” is embodied in the way she handles the petal and gauges Kael’s memory. The micro-choice to dissolve the petal while holding his grief shows contradictory impulses in scene. Cost is legible: she accepts the ache in her heart as the price of professional distance. One slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than dramatized beyond the satchel check.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is sketched but generic; the locket photo and “cycles of compassion” are asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. The decisive act—initiating the correspondence—reads as externally prompted rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction. No felt cost or flaw complicates the choice; the friendship crystallizes without testing her shrewdness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s longing to belong is palpable and embodied in her reed-work, but the interior contradictions and micro-choices under pressure remain generalized; the final “recognition” is more stated than dramatized, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—she feels the pendant’s warmth, steps onto the ledge—but the “ability to sculpt time” is asserted rather than embodied; her final realization reads as epiphanic summary rather than earned contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The cost (she must leave the Heart) is stated but not dramatized in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “mind racing with possibilities” and “buried optimism” feel earned—but the mentor’s disappearance is summarized rather than embodied, muting the emotional stakes. The final choice to proceed despite the warning is credible, yet the cost is more stated than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dweller's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains generalized—no contradictory impulses surface in scene. The final smile is earned, yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the turn is narrated rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured—her fear of surrender is embodied in the trembling hand and the “hollow” whisper—but the shift from observer to self-transformer is asserted more than dramatized; the leaf acts as catalyst rather than earned mirror. The final renunciation is credible yet feels slightly cushioned by lyricism rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s insomnia and artistic compulsion are embodied in concrete micro-choices (following rain trails, pocketing the brooch), but the final acceptance of her role as “keeper of stories” arrives more as thematic pronouncement than earned renunciation; the cost is gestured at rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her doubt about her clairvoyance is embodied in the “gnawing” sensation and the way she hesitates before touching the pearl. The moment she merges with the cave, her contradictory impulses (fear vs. surrender) are dramatized in real time. The final renunciation—accepting that her gift is to inhabit uncertainty—carries a felt cost: she leaves the cave “transformed” but forever bound to the unseen. Minor slip: the phrase “willingness to inhabit the shadows” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her boots sinking,” “fingers trembled”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final acceptance of vocation feels more bestowed than wrestled. The keeper’s appearance supplies external pressure, yet Elara’s micro-choice to raise the trumpet again is under-motivated—no visible cost or flaw complicates it. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the moment of belonging lands with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and analytical-artistic duality are sketched but remain abstract; her “trembling certainty” is stated rather than embodied. The final choice to punch the ticket is motivated, yet the interior contradiction between fear and curiosity is only asserted, not dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “void” and “longing” manifest in tactile actions like pocketing the tile and climbing the tower. The micro-choice to transcribe the numbers shows her skepticism eroding under pressure. Yet the shift from doubt to belief is compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels light. Secondary characters are off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elyr’s boredom is palpable early, but when pressure rises his “hunger” remains abstract. Interiority dips into expository summary (“aching void,” “endless emptiness”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction; the final pivot to “spark of purpose” lands more as declaration than embodied cost. Micro-choice under stress—continuing to fracture reality despite immediate risk—is there but under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s honesty-as-flaw is embodied in micro-choices (handing back the pot, steady gaze) and the final refusal to keep lying; the father’s softening is credible. Interiority avoids therapy-speak. Yet the father’s shift is compressed into a single glance, so the relational crucible feels sketched rather than forged.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s studious precision and singular motive are vivid, but her interiority stays safely consistent; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the final “gift” feels accepted rather than wrestled with. The cost is atmospheric, not personal—her trembling hands register awe, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“their breath mingling with the salt-laden air”), but the wanderer’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; no micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path with cost. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradiction between myth-busting profession and personal hunger for mythic truth is embodied in her micro-choices under cello pressure; interiority remains concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“strange warmth spread through her palm”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final stance crystallizes yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the hourglass grain anchors her grief and choice. The mentor’s posthumous message supplies a clear motive, but the final endurance (“outlast the dawn”) is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulse, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal contradictions are shown—she is both meticulous and quietly assertive—through her bodily cues and micro-decisions under pressure. The blindness trait is dramatized: “her blind eyes closed… and listened to the light,” a concrete tactic. Flaws come at cost—her magnetic calm is tested by the depot noise—yet the renunciation in the final beat is slightly generalized, keeping the score below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's quest is lucid: every reflection pivots back to "rivers' source"; the final kneel reconfigures the atlas into a living flow. Interiority rings—"not of joy but of understanding" is earned and embodied. Minor drift: the phrase "dog-eared phrasebook" recurs too often without fresh action. Yet the cost stands—renunciation of mapping for lived witness.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s patience is stated but never tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost. Interiority is generic (“infinitely patient,” “deeper than nostalgia”) rather than embodied. The final smile is unmotivated by any on-page struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya registers as a credible marine biologist, but her crisis interiority leans generic (“dwindling sense of hope,” “fear to wonder”) and lacks embodied contradiction under suffocation pressure. The shift from survival to epistemic drive is asserted more than dramatized; it feels convenient to arc rather than wrung from conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“copperlight repose… felt cost”) and motivation stays rooted, but Elias’s final shift from guilt to defiant truth-teller reads asserted more than embodied at cliff-edge intensity—micro-choice lacks visible last-minute friction, muting earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative (“lovingly venomous connection”) and embodied, but the ghost bride’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final beat, so the renunciation feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives (“carve a path from ruin to reverence”) are stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; her sleepwalking method is asserted, not tested. The final stance is serene but the cost is diffuse—no visible forfeiture or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“her boots sinking into the soft earth”), but the shift from cautious curiosity to restored faith is more asserted than dramatized; the final beat lacks a visible cost that would make the change earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation (“meaning in the margins”) stays consistent; micro-choice to trace chalk, extract letter, and smile before leaving shows earned renunciation with felt cost of dawn catching her.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her needle hovering, heartbeat syncing with the flame—but the mentor-shaped void is asserted more than dramatized, muting the cost of her final resolve. Lira’s reappearance supplies relational pressure, yet their shared history is sketched in shorthand, blunting the crucible effect. The earned shift from skepticism to guardianship of the flame is legible, though the prior causality feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between fear and need to heal is palpable. Her micro-choice to break the seal on her own unsent letter crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Backstory is woven tightly through present cues and alters tactics. Only a slight drift toward therapeutic self-diagnosis in “she had once been like the spirits here” keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured, her motivations legible, her “shrewd innocence” active when it forces her toward the coral; yet some emotion edges into stock phrasing (“lotus-hearted”). Her renunciation cost is shown—she carries the coral and the vanished child’s memory out into the mist—but a stronger embodied pang would clinch higher ground.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her drained passion, tactile curiosity at the fresco, and embodied awe at the film—but the shift from burden to joy is compressed into a single beat rather than earned through escalating contradiction. Micro-choices (kneeling, loading film, painting fog) align with motive, yet no visible flaw or cost complicates the final act; the arc feels smoothed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “conversing with the art,” the warm pulse of the coin—but the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity is asserted more than dramatized; the garden’s final awakening feels gifted rather than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s rogue-scholar charm is sketched in broad strokes; the interior contradiction between fear and defiance is asserted rather than embodied. The moment he pockets the seed and chooses to follow Mira is a clear micro-choice, but the cost is only declared (“we’re being hunted”) not felt. Dr. Krane’s shift from potential threat to ally is too swift to register as crucible pressure. Overall, credible but not yet individuated under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “shyly unstoppable” nature is asserted rather than embodied in concrete micro-choices. Motivation (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is stated repeatedly yet never tested by an opposing force or visible trade-off. The final lullaby feels inevitable, but only because the story insists on it, not because prior beats foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s caretaker identity and “gently systematic” trait shape her tactile, ritualized handling of the glass orchids and wind chime; her interior contradiction—duty vs. foxglove regret—surfaces in the moment she hesitates before the Vessel. The final renunciation (shattered chime, preserved names) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Only minor drift: the “foxglove regret” label is stated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “carefully reckless” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (brushing spines, trembling hands). The three promises give her a clear hierarchy of values, and the final exchange with Kael crystallizes a credible shift. Yet the mentor remains off-stage until the last beat, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his mind “worked like the gears of the floodgates”—and his trembling hands embody doubt. Yet the shift from doubt to resolve feels slightly compressed; the poem’s final line does the emotional lifting rather than a dramatized beat. Still, the cost of compromise is felt when he sketches the design “in the dust,” foreclosing destruction. Characterization is strong but stops just short of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her grip on the meteorite, her humming to pigeons—but the reinvention of history remains abstract; no single on-page lie is risked or exposed, blunting the cost of her final honesty. The blooming/withering metaphor is repeated rather than dramatized in body or choice. Still, her micro-choice to map dust instead of flee shows a clear value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “featherly determination” is embodied in the deliberate way she steps onto the groaning glass—but the father remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the final renunciation feels more asserted than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath fogging the glass, her hand sketching fireflies—but the “landscape astrologer” label never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains ornamental. The burnt feather’s transformation from loss to acceptance is cleanly dramatized, yet the final dance feels slightly unearned because the facility’s alarms arrive as external coincidence rather than consequence of her flaw. Still, her contradictory impulses (stay/dance vs. flee) coexist in the same beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test at a lower register.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her longing for the lost laughter is palpable—but the “recollectionist” label remains ornamental; no occupational detail constrains her tactics. The final renunciation (accepting that paths must be rediscovered) is earned and carries felt cost, yet the contradiction between clinging and releasing is stated more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s motivation—“to serenade monotony with creativity”—is stated but never tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to his performance. Interiority stays abstract (“he believed,” “he had once been”) rather than embodied under pressure. The final beat shows no renunciation or alteration of stance; he simply walks on, unchanged. Micro-choices are missing; the bishop’s moves mirror events but Elias never faces a dilemma that would reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s desire to inscribe memory on skin is vivid, but her internal contradiction (yearning vs. fear of erasure) is stated more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels more asserted than embodied. “She knew the risk—discovery meant erasure” tells rather than shows the stakes on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied—his ritual with the prism, the stone toss, the hush inside the atrium—but the “noctilucent reckoning” is delivered as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, so the final stance feels lightly earned rather than paid for in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and caretaker identity are embodied in the cracked box he cradles; the feather vision re-weights his stance, but the epiphany leans toward summary rather than a micro-choice with immediate cost, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the gauge, her deliberate re-patterning under the tide—but the final “hope is not something to be calculated” epiphany is articulated rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority shows tactile reactions (trembling fingers) and immediate sensory tuning, but the shift from inherited duty to joyful purpose lacks micro-evidence prior to the closure epiphany. The burden is declared rather than embodied through hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—persuading mirrors to show possibility—is lucid and embodied through her bodily sacrifice. The borrowed heartbeat motif threads interior contradiction: she must weaken herself to empower others. Micro-choice—singing louder as mirrors resist—reveals value hierarchy (others’ futures > her pulse). Cost lands on page: “her own heartbeat now fainter.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the clipboard, the tremor in her voice—but the “price of redemption” is asserted more than embodied; no single micro-choice visibly costs her a concrete piece of herself. The leaders remain silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her final renunciation of pure diplomacy earns a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cold calculation vs. secret sentiment—are dramatized in the moment she kneels to plant the egg; the tremor in her hands and the remembered birdsongs embody the cost. Motivation is rooted in her past crimes and present guilt, driving the single decisive act. The flaw (amoral complicity) directly complicates the choice and charges the closure. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her paradoxical identity and bodily poetics are embodied in the thread-untangling—but the “chaste courtesan” label never complicates her tactics; no sexual or social risk is felt. The final smile registers cost, yet the prior beats lack contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; his “serene” label is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. The pivot from dismantling to rebuilding narratives is declared rather than dramatized, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. No secondary character pressure is on the page, so relationships-as-crucible is moot.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers paused, as if sensing an interrupted cadence”), but the piece leans on summary rather than micro-choice under pressure; the final act of adding the monarch wing feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradiction. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands that were both precise and tender”), but the forgiveness arc is told rather than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the prior regret is only summarized. Micro-choices under pressure are present (re-weaving the rope) and align with her stated motive.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Foresight’s interiority is vivid—fingers brushing the wafer seal, heart racing at resonance—but the “why paths choose walkers” motive is stated more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final transcendence feels inevitable yet the cost is only implied, not embodied. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s frugality and irony are stated but never embodied in a costly choice; the final covenant feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal struggle. Interiority remains generic (“profound sense of purpose”) rather than concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” label is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory tactics; her interiority is calm exposition rather than embodied conflict. Kael’s resentment softens too smoothly—no micro-choice shows the cost of yielding. The cellular-memory shortcut bypasses visible struggle, muting character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to “capture a runaway dream” is stated early and re-asserted at the end, but the interior contradiction between grounded craft and impossible yearning is only asserted, not dramatized in micro-choice. Her single decisive action—raising the restored sextant—feels inevitable yet the cost (loss of fog-shielded isolation) is named rather than embodied. Secondary character remains a cipher; no status tension or relationship crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the ribbon, the quartz glint—but the “feisty” trait is asserted more than embodied; her choices pivot on reflection rather than contradiction. The final renunciation of the old vow is earned, yet the cost feels generalized (“months of doubt”) rather than dramatized in a single, sharp beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“faint hum that resonated in her chest”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final acceptance of heirship feels more conferred than earned, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly asserted but only once embodied—when she bargains with the guardian. Interiority is generic (“her mind already racing”) and Kael remains a plot device rather than pressure. The final bargain shows earned cost, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity and grief are embodied in tactile micro-choices (clutching the card, kneeling among threads), but the interior contradiction between finding Lyra and finding herself is asserted more than dramatized. The final step through the door feels earned by the weaving of others’ memories, yet the cost—dissolution of the card—reads symbolic rather than personally wounding. Secondary pressure from the ship’s ghosts is atmospheric, not interpersonal, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing rope, matching seal to braid), but interiority stays safe; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the final step through the door feels inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—“to protect the fragile harmony of her world”—is clear early and recycled each time pressure rises; her micro-choice to risk letting the storm write itself into the seed qualifies as a beat, yet interiority never cracks open a genuine contradiction beneath the surface. Embodied emotion is generic (“her heart steady,” “her spirit light”) rather than particular, though the final renunciation is visible on the page. Competence slightly exceeds struggle: the bloom appears when summoned, rather than forcing unforeseen sacrifice, muting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior monologue is vivid and embodied, but the moment of memory sacrifice flirts with an explained epiphany ("she realized coincidences were threads..."). The prior micro-choices justify the renunciation and Earned Stasis is legible, yet the final line’s overt thematic articulation dampens interior contradiction and costs us a fraction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied in her tactile care of artifacts and her willingness to press into the fog-wall, but the interior contradiction between memory-preserver and memory-conduit is stated more than dramatized; the final “deepening hush” registers as mood rather than a visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and embodied through ritual action, but interiority stays at a single register; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. The final “Tonight, we rise” lands as declaration rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s need to “touch” time is clear from the grotto frame, yet interior contradiction feels distilled rather than dramatized; the choice to accept cyclical connectedness at closure earns its visible emotional cost through the cicada’s reweighted hum rather than any fresh micro-choice mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and yearning are embodied in her tight-chested climbs and doll-whispered dreams, but the interior contradiction between safety and freedom is summarized more than dramatized in scene; the final “never be the same” is asserted rather than shown through a concrete behavioral shift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the storm-glass vial externalizes his motive and Mira’s shift. The final “Silence taught you how to comfort yourself” crystallizes earned change with visible cost. Minor drift: Mira’s turmoil is sketched more than dramatized, limiting crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized through cautious mural-peeling and decisive ascent, but interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation is earned yet cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—scars as tethers, the ache of a severed link—but the “teach suffocating to breathe” motive is asserted more than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet lacks prior contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s survivor past is stated but never pressures her present choices; the “virtuously mischievous” trait is asserted rather than embodied in action. Interiority is generic (“her heart pounding with shadowseam wonder”) and emotions are labeled, not embodied. The decisive act—activating the machine—reads as obedient rather than driven by a contradictory impulse. No visible cost or change in her stance is dramatized at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s interiority is textured—her grip on the crank handle as “promise,” her refusal to speak on the bridge—but the betrayal revelation arrives as inherited summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric’s interiority is vivid—armor as burden, parchment as talisman—but the shift from passive observer to “storyteller” is asserted more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (unsnapping gauntlet) is elegant yet too light to bear the full weight of claimed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is specific and embodied ("her own story had fractured"); Elara’s contradictory drive—cataloguing others’ pain to cauterize her own—grounds motivation. The moment she feels kinship with Liam is earned. However, her final “lighter heart” arrives with too little in-scene cost; emancipation and archival rediscovery compress trauma without friction, trimming the emotional amplitude needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her fingers tracing the key, the tremble as she lifts the ledger—but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “tyranny of indifference” rhetoric. The final vanishing is earned, yet the contradictory impulses (fear vs defiance) are asserted more than dramatized in the moment she transmits the data.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the saxophonist’s contradictory impulses (duty vs. exhaustion) are implied rather than embodied. The final renunciation—lowering the horn—earns its cost through the grotto’s visible exhale, yet the character’s flaws remain gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the decisive shift from “orderly seed sorter” to “guardian of forgotten truths” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost of this transformation is named rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—his obsession with precision versus his embrace of uncertainty—is embodied in the compass and the final renunciation of “fixing” time. Micro-choices (wading into the pool, folding the map back) show value hierarchy. The shift from repair to creation is earned, though the stranger’s motivation remains off-page, slightly softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (coin’s warmth, furnace’s cold iron), but her “luminous regret” is stated rather than dramatized, and the final resolve feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “modestly fearless” stance shows in the steady heartbeat and deliberate harp touch—but the contradictory impulse (fear vs. resolve) is stated rather than dramatized mid-scene. The father’s grief is embodied through the memory of the boy laughing, yet Elara’s own cost is only a “luminous ache,” not a visible forfeiture. Micro-choice at climax (playing the final note) is clear, but the prior beats lack a felt struggle that would make the renunciation sting.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, the warm bark, the mask strap’s weight—but the “mathematics of mercy” remains an abstract label rather than a felt contradiction. The final release of the strap earns a credible renunciation, yet the prior beats do not dramatize competing impulses around mercy itself; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing the elusively tangible edge”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to leave the tower feels more inevitable than costly. Backstory is woven with present cues, yet the emotional stakes flatten in the last beat. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus’s gift and motivation are sketched early and remain consistent; the moment he lifts the mainspring barrel and feels the chill embodies the contradiction between curiosity and dread. His final act—inserting the barrel—earns a credible renunciation of his own safety for the ghosts’ release, though interiority is sometimes generic (“weightless burden” label). No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a solid arc but not yet razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s desire to “compress eternity into a single, perfect moment” is stated early and revisited at the end, but the interior contradiction between order and chaos is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Her micro-choice to descend into the clouds is visible, yet the cost (loss of safety, identity shift) is only implied. Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction under pressure. Still, the arc from observer to caretaker is coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (redemption vs. lingering shame) are dramatized in the Hall of Reflections beat. The shard as talisman and lens is embodied, not ornamental. Yet the “burnished sorrow” label in the final paragraph edges into diagnostic shorthand, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is consistent but abstract; his interiority is lyrical rather than embodied. The moment he “frees” the box is decisive yet feels externally scripted—no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final understanding (“mending what isn’t torn”) lands as summary, not earned cost. Still, his arc is legible and stakes are personal.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and inherited quest are clear, but interiority stays at summary level (“she understood now”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation of the compass is credible yet the psychic cost is asserted more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mara’s obsession with the slide is explicit, but her interiority flirts with therapist speak; contradictory impulses under pressure remain more asserted than embodied. The payoff—choosing to continue the timewoven legacy—arrives too smoothly, undercutting the visible cost required for earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire to “understand why flowers bloom at night” is stated early and echoed at the end, but the interior contradiction (quiet drive vs. fear of failure) is only summarized, never dramatized in a single micro-choice under pressure. The decisive act—painting the mural—lacks on-page causality linking the cathedral visit to the final brushstroke; we are told she “began to paint” rather than shown a charged moment of renunciation or risk. No embodied cost (fatigue, doubt, material limit) is made legible, so the change feels pre-ordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-driven determination is embodied in tactile rituals (tracing the spine, arranging shells) and crystallizes in her steady “I’ve come to parley.” Yet the retrocognitive entrapment is asserted more than dramatized; we never feel her mind slip or pay a visible price, so the interior contradiction remains partly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive is declared early and her interiority stays consistent, but the text tells us she “rejected nostalgia” and “realized her work was done” rather than dramatizing those pivots with embodied contradiction or micro-choice. The bottle glows, the town revives, yet she never faces an active trade-off or visible cost; her agency is largely contemplative. Earned Stasis is asserted, not performed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“velvet disquiet”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final “I remember” feels more ritual than hard choice, so the cost is present yet not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—preserve genetic legacy, unlock borrowed time—but interiority drifts into abstraction (“texture of borrowed time”) without embodied stakes. The grandmother’s whisper is backstory-only; no micro-choice tied to it pressures the present. The final resolve feels pre-packaged rather than forged under on-page cost. No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene; emotions are stated, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to test storms while craving quiet—are embodied in sensor-tuning vs rope-tugging; the moment he silences the wind to “listen” crystallizes a values hierarchy that forecloses the safety of the siren test and seeds the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet pride,” “spiritually curious”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the shift from janitor to cosmic steward is asserted rather than tested under pressure. The final renunciation is credible yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her lived flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s astonishment is asserted, not embodied; interiority drifts into generic “quiet symphony” abstractions. His choices—finding box, performing ritual—feel externally scripted rather than compelled by contradictory impulses. The ghosts’ silence is noted, but Elias’s own unspoken weight never visibly costs him anything. Closure arrives as gentle uplift, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is serviceable—her curiosity and quiet resolve feel consistent—but the pivotal decision to activate the temporal weaver is under-motivated; we see no embodied contradiction or micro-choice that makes the leap from “intrigued” to “risk everything” legible. Thaddeus exists only as an info-dump, so relationship pressure is nil.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; “searching for inspiration” and “weave words into dawns” are stock phrases. The poet’s contradictory impulses (to finish vs. accept incompleteness) surface only in dialogue, not embodied choice. The final shared release earns a modest shift, but cost is soft—no forfeiture beyond handing over the feather.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“brazen calm unbroken”), but the story leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the final renunciation is earned yet stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skeptical drive is clear, but her interiority drifts into generic “awe” at the summit; the shift from academic rebellion to quiet acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through embodied contradiction. The pilgrim’s silent nod is under-leveraged—no status or pressure exchange occurs—so the relationship crucible is absent. The final “softened skepticism” lacks a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Coachman’s motive—garden reclaiming battlefield—is clear and embodied in the kneeling, seeding micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete (weathered hands, creaking knees) but leans toward lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulse in scene. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Earned stasis feels present yet cost is more asserted (“weight of centuries”) than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s curiosity is credibly rekindled, but his interiority stays general (“curiosity stirred like embers”) and the final smile feels unearned—no embodied cost for choosing connection. Lira is only a courier; she exerts no pressure. The bloodhound past is evocative yet never alters present tactics. Micro-choices are sparse; the leaf does the work instead of Elias’s flawed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers traced…heart heavy”), but the contradiction between her gift and isolation is summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“ready to chart a new course”), satisfying the Earned Stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “cautious abandon” surfaces in the queen-rook swap—but the shift from hardened thief to wonder-reclaimer is asserted more than embodied; the cost of that re-opening is named, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied (“luminous absence within her”), but the shift from role-bound to self-owned feels more narrated than dramatized; the chessboard and walking pattern act as external mirrors rather than active crucibles. Kael’s benevolent ruthlessness is stated, not tested—no on-page cost or choice reveals the trait. The final “unbinding” is credible but leans on Kael’s pronouncement rather than a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s drive to “understand the shape of home” is emotionally legible, yet the text mostly asserts her buried-talent pain rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses that feed her decisions; the final integration feels narrated rather than suffered through embodied choice. The shift is stated rather than performed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are embodied in her tactile chess piece and the tapestry decoding; the final “quiet resolve” lands as earned stasis. Interiority is specific, but the parallel to the king/pawn parable is delivered as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Character traits—rebellion, poetic drive, longing for refracted forgiveness—are consistently rendered through embodied actions (brushing stone, poetry improvisation). Interiority, however, edges toward abstract declaration: “I am the shattered mirror” crystallizes choice but feels spoken rather than struggled-with. Final cost (a shard of heart surrendered) is declared more than dramatized, blunting legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, oil-and-rust air—but her “uncertainty” is asserted more than dramatized; the final declaration “We are all broken” lands as therapeutic summary rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (aligning charm to statue) are present yet feel guided by external enchantment rather than internal flaw. Cost is gestured at (workshop tilts, acid sea) but not made viscerally hers.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and anchored—”her heart anchored in memories yet distant” shows embodied contradiction—but choices lean into observation rather than friction: painting the oasis is a natural extension, not a true crucible. The promise is dramatized through the act of painting, yet its personal cost is asserted more than felt; no rival value or outside force tests her aloof stance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his doubts about silence versus shouts are embodied in the humming cork and the ache in his chest. The final choice to follow the woman and accept the lesson is earned by prior beats: the cork’s hum, the garden scent, the beckoning silhouette. Cost is visible in the renunciation of louder self-assertion. Secondary character pressure is minimal; the woman functions more as oracle than crucible, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “raw from hours of labor” and her heart “swelling” anchor emotion in body—but the shift from solitary exile to communal shepherd is asserted more than dramatized; the decisive moment of letting the first traveler in is summarized, not shown, blunting the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational discipline vs. the eye’s forced honesty—drives every beat; the orchard’s weight and the final relinquishment carry felt cost. Motivation (psychological safety) is embodied in tactile choices, not labels. Minor slip: Mara’s brief exposition softens the crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his fixation on gaps, the boutonnière as trust, the journal as burden—but the decisive shift to “keep them safe” is more stated than dramatized; we feel the weight but don’t see the immediate cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s loneliness and intuitive gift are sketched, but interior contradiction is thin; the “lingering promise” is accepted with near-passive wonder rather than conflicting impulses. His decisive shift from isolation to purpose is asserted more than dramatized—no visible cost or renunciation forecloses an alternate path. Micro-choices under pressure are missing; the ants guide him, but he doesn’t wrestle with doubt or stakes. Character voice is consistent yet generic, lacking idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    The queen’s resolve is palpable, but interior contradiction is soft, expressed through generic “tremor in her chest” rather than embodied cost. The renunciation—shouldering guardianship of starlight—lands, yet the arc from dream-driven seeker to guardian feels told rather than dramatized; no micro-choice in the chamber reveals a visible shift in hierarchy of values. Interiority drifts between regal abstraction and folk wisdom (“fireflies in her heart”) without a distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“calloused yet delicate,” “scientifically romantic heart”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the moment of choice is soft, more chant than crucible. Kael’s presence supplies relational pressure, yet the shift in their bond is asserted rather than dramatized. The cost—loss of the fleeting moment—is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing,” “poison seeping”), but the decisive shift from envy to gratitude is compressed into a single beat of dialogue rather than dramatized micro-choices; the cost is felt yet lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's tactile navigation of her anosmia-driven world is vivid and specific—her “hands, though steady, trembled with a calm born of both loss and resilience.” Yet her final crystallization (“ability to see what others could not”) slips slightly into summary epiphany rather than fully earned contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete; embodied stress in hand-scars and crystallizing quill work. Motivation “transform scars into stories” anchors stakes. Only micro-choice of breathing through superstition lacks enactment cost, capping 9-entry.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers tracing the ridges,” “her breath catching”), but the apology is delivered as a current rather than a concrete micro-choice, softening the cost. The perfume bottle and orchard memories press her, yet the final beat feels more received than earned. Still, her contradictory impulses—guilt, longing, professional detachment—are palpable in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The witness is sketched more as archetype than person; interiority is abstract (“felt the weight of their task”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, and the final epiphany arrives without visible cost to the self. Motivation is stated, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—calloused hands, squinting at the inscription—but the epiphany (“Clocks measure moments that define existence”) arrives as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost (he stays to interpret, not just maintain), yet the shift from skepticism to reverence is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is sensuous but drifts toward therapeutic summary—e.g., “felt familiar but knew.” The change to an open stance is signaled, but the contradiction between professional mandate and philosophical surrender is more declared than dramatized. The mushroom gift is a gesture without visible cost on the page, softening the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rebellion vs. responsibility—are dramatized in her handling of the lantern and the notebook, but the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“clover melancholy”) rather than embodied tension. The final resolve to “begin” is credible yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s loneliness and “cultivated estrangement” are sketched with evocative interiority, but the pivot from emotional insulation to active bridge-builder is compressed into a single late beat; the glass disc functions more as plot key than character crucible, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, locket warmth—but her “gently thorough” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a choice that costs her something. The moment with Mara is touching yet passive; Elara listens rather than acts, so the decisive shift to “participate in regeneration” feels lightly earned. Still, her contradictory awe and burden create credible tension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s loneliness is sketched in evocative abstractions (“gnaws at the soul”) rather than embodied contradiction; the moon-rock talisman is mentioned but never used to force a micro-choice. The final shift from shield-humor to genuine laughter is declared, not dramatized, so the cost feels asserted rather than earned. Interiority stays safely therapeutic, avoiding the irrational tangle that would make her flaws bite.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skin-language absorption and tactile cartography are embodied, not labeled—but the final beat of self-discovery is slightly abstract, muting the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“pen began to warm…weight of history”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulse—wanting to be heard yet choosing silence—earns quiet charge through mid-scene choices (traces patterns, smiles at the “click”). Flaw of fading memory provides cost, but interiority occasionally slips toward therapeutic exposition, blunting friction enough to cap below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior states remain largely summary-level ("analytically intuitive" told, not shown); no live contradictory impulse on the page. Endurance costs are merely implied—no concrete forfeiture visible—and thus the final shift feels foreordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her finger-drumming habit anchors her dissociation—but the “quietly rebellious” trait is asserted rather than dramatized until the final beat. The entangled-memories concept is felt through sensory hallucination, yet the shift from victim to weaver-of-dreams arrives more as epiphany than earned contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s walk-recognition gift is embodied once (recognizing Mira) and motivates the final stance, but interiority drifts into summary (“loneliness that permeated”) rather than contradictory impulse. Mira’s desperation is gestured, not dramatized; her shift from taunt to respect feels asserted. The earned cost—accepting Mira’s dare—lands, yet Eli’s flaw (isolation) is not visibly compounded before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Guardian’s stillness and mirror use are embodied, but the “teach darkness the value of stars” motive is asserted rather than dramatized; no interior contradiction surfaces under pressure, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative but remains abstract; his “ability to hear unspoken words” is stated rather than embodied in a choice that costs him. The final beat—“pride and accomplishment”—reads as summary, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. No embodied contradiction or visible price is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands vs dancer’s grace, the guarded heart—but the “true nature” remains abstract; the detachment beat is gestured rather than dramatized with embodied cost, so the final choice feels slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her mechanical whittling and blank mask embody the mandate’s cost—but the brother’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the emotional stakes. The final Earned Stasis (pressing the heart to the window) is earned by prior pattern yet lacks a sharper contradiction in-scene to push her past endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “tremor of certainty” is felt yet not embodied in a specific, contradictory micro-choice until the final surrender. The renunciation of prior boundaries is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Voice remains consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his colorblindness reframed as “lens” and plant-craft as language—but the shift from limitation to acceptance is summarized rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire for “texture of connection” is declared but never embodied in a concrete, costly choice; her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she questioned her assumptions”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The carbide-lens experiment is observation, not crucible—no visible trade-off or mistake. Ending renunciation is asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lively interiority and loss-rooted habit show contradiction between numb habit and quiet yearning. The micro-choice to press the stencil against her skin crystallizes motive, yet the shift feels lightly rather than heavily earned; we do not fully witness the spike of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—shuffling cards, brushing the tape, aligning data—each tightening her investigative arc. The internal contradiction (curiosity vs. inherited fatalism) is embodied, not labeled. Mira’s arrival supplies relational pressure that forces Elara to risk her sanctuary; their shared silence after the mural is an earned stasis with visible cost. No slips, but the final beat could carry a hair more bodily cost to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for knowledge vs. fear of self-loss—are embodied in her trembling fingers and the whispered word that triggers the pagoda. The final “anguished joy” lands as earned stasis: she renounces external mastery for internal integration, the cost legible in her glowing veil. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“atoms of nostalgia”) flirt with abstraction. Overall, a vivid, flawed seeker whose micro-choice reconfigures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“luminous regret” felt in her soul), but her contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final choice to “metamorphose” the shadow is emotionally resonant yet causally under-motivated, relying more on thematic assertion than prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her trembling hands, the cedar scent, the tail tip as talisman—but the “shedding layers” epiphany is delivered in summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost of her shift. The final micro-choice (placing the tail on the shelf) is graceful yet feels pre-ordained, not wrested from clashing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire to “read the stories in scars” is stated but never tested in scene; her interiority is lyrical but generic, and the final healing feels gifted rather than earned through a visible micro-choice. No contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembling,” “mind racing”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final choice to carry the strip feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s longing is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“shadowed rapture”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice under pressure yet. Motivation is clear but static—no escalation or cost on the page. Astrolabe handling is sensory, yet it doesn’t force a decision or reveal a blind spot. Closure is pending, so full arc untested.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her boots sinking, the satchel’s mystery, the clock’s weight—but the “occasionally everywhere” gaze is ornamental, never complicating a choice. The final smile feels tidy; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the archive. Still, her embodied awe and the micro-choice to clasp the charm anchor her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eamon’s interiority is evocative—“labyrinth walls shifting every time he slept”—but the gear remains a static talisman rather than a tool that forces a choice; his final insight is declared rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. The translocations, while mentioned, never complicate tactics or reveal internal stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is textured—her boots echoing, the ticket frayed—but the “unused courage” remains an abstract label rather than a felt contradiction; the ferryman’s younger self appears too late to pressure her choice, so the final transfer of the star stamp reads symbolic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his stillness is embodied in micro-choices like hovering fingers over keys—but the “seraphically mundane” trait never constrains action; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more stated than felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s resolve is vivid, but her interior contradictions remain abstract; the pretender’s desperation is shown only in summary. The iron-gall pellet moment crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels external rather than embodied. Motivation is coherent but not deeply mined under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—tapping rhythms, coral grief, the atlas obsession—but the moment of “realization” is delivered as summary rather than dramatized choice, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s awkward confidence is embodied consistently—bare feet against cold concrete, hesitant hand on the stone circle—yet her interiority stays specific, never slipping into therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (yearning vs defeat) are present in every beat; the final decision to “reignite them… with quiet confidence” is foreshadowed by her refusal earlier to raise literal weapons. Motives scale in cost: from passive observation to active risking of personal myth by trusting the hum. One slip: the grandmother backstory feels summarized, not dramatized enough to sharpen present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “wrinkled finger” on the kite, the ache in her joints—but the moment of unsealing feels slightly epiphanic rather than earned by prior contradiction. The guard’s brief appearance supplies external pressure, yet his collapse is too convenient to test Mara’s resolve. Still, her final resolve to “plant the seeds of a new era” carries visible cost: the cracked embryo now glows in her hands, foreclosing secrecy. The insurgent-grandmother archetype is individualized through plant-telepathy and generational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Zara’s trauma-borne compulsion to protect the photograph is vivid, but the internal contradiction between paralyzing fear and blossoming creativity flips too cleanly in the penultimate paragraph; a more frayed transition to her first decisive sketch would earn higher.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembling,” “luminescent pulse”), but the shift from despair to resolve feels compressed; the grandmother backstory is brief yet anchored. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the final stance crystallizes without visible cost beyond the ache. Meets single-POV demands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief and resolve are embodied in her purposeful gait and the drone’s release; the moment she sees her brother’s last moments crystallizes her shift from vengeance to acceptance. Yet the interior contradiction between anger and serenity is stated more than dramatized, and the final choice feels lightly earned because the cost is implied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior conflict is embodied in trembling fingers and racing heart, but the “bravely conflicted” label is repeated rather than dramatized; the final choice to copy the data is credible yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s pacifism is stated early and revisited when she accepts the blade, but the interior contradiction between belief and necessity is summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels unearned because the cost of holding the weapon is never embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is shown rather than told, but the interiority stays general (“felt a pull in his chest”) rather than contradictory or embodied. The final renunciation—accepting the goddess’s echo remains—earns a modest cost, yet the stakes feel abstract because the echo’s absence never endangers anything concrete. Motivation is consistent but not intensified under pressure; the goddess’s question merely confirms what he already sought.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing the nib, the ache of “orbits of regret”—but the final recalibration feels slightly under-motivated; we needed one more embodied beat of doubt or cost to earn the renunciation fully.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in the amber stare and the tremor when she opens the letters; the final renunciation—writing as the lost child—earns its cost through prior causality. The contradictory impulse (to silence vs. to listen) is dramatized in the firmware’s shifting whispers. Minor slip: “meteor hush” is slightly performative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—cool flake against skin, lilac unease—but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation (“courage to stand in the mess”) is felt yet not fully foreclosed by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—warm heart / cold resolve—is stated, not embodied; her single micro-choice (re-arranging tesserae) is too gentle to register cost. Retrocognition is label-only, never constrains tactics. Motivation (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) remains abstract, never sharpened into a visible trade-off. No earned stasis or decisive renunciation; the ending drifts into hope without foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception, embodied nostalgia—but her contradictory impulses remain largely ornamental; the “other Mara” is more emblem than crucible, so the cost of guiding her feels abstract rather than personally foreclosing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s skepticism and affection are stated rather than embodied; interiority is abstract (“she believed,” “she needed”). The geode-as-anchor is a static symbol; no contradictory impulses play out in real time. The final smile is unearned because the cost of her all-night labor is never made visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—“emotions left imprints, like echoes”—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the fossil’s pull is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels narrated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her trembling fingers, deliberate grace, and the surge when she touches the bone button—but the contradiction between “quietly inspired” and “trembling” is asserted rather than dramatized. The final choice to carry the wisdom forward is clear yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied; we sense renunciation but not its specific weight on her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—scars, pillbox, breath in cold—but the “unused courage” epiphany is asserted more than dramatized; the letter functions as external prompt rather than earned internal shift, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Coachman's motivation—distilling complexity into essence—is cleanly telegraphed and revisited, but the figure-mentor arrives ex nihilo: no prior pressure or relational crucible puts the coachman’s flaw into play, so the “promise” revelation feels more lecture than earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is calm and embodied, but her shift from curiosity to stewardship is asserted rather than dramatized; the final communal act is off-stage, muting the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing against the lockmaster’s tooth”), but the final beat of handing over the tooth feels slightly under-motivated—no prior contradiction or cost is dramatized. The “wistfully pragmatic” trait is shown through action, yet the lockmaster’s arrival and instant kinship compresses relational pressure into a single glance, softening the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots sinking,” “fingers brushed”), but the shift from scholar to guardian is asserted more than dramatized; the orb fusion resolves the arc yet feels lightly foreshadowed. Motivation is clear, but the cost of coexistence is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority flickers between concrete specificity (she walks “with purpose”) and generic abstractions (“something greater”). The thrush-talisman works both as externalized motive and as tool, a clever unifying object, yet the climactic “touched it once last time” registers an internal shift rather than an embodied cost. Backstory as ghostwriter is efficiently seeded; no time is burned on back-story blocks that do not tilt her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s cautious hope and grit are embodied in micro-choices (tracing charts, calibrating subwoofer) and a final resolve. Interiority is specific, but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized. Relationship with Hank supplies brief status pressure. Endurance earns stasis with visible cost—she stays alone at the station.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in the narrowing passage and trembling fingers, but the interior contradiction between fear and yearning is stated more than dramatized in the moment of crisis; the final “embrace the mutiny” shift feels slightly abstract rather than earned by a visible micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied in her charcoal sketching and ribbon tracing, but the interior contradiction between “seeing beyond features” and literal inability to recognize faces is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final shift—empathy awakened through art—feels more declared than earned; no visible cost or irrevocable choice seals the change.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring her great-uncle’s memory—tracks clearly, yet her interior contradiction (“nervously confident”) is reported, not embodied in conflicting micro-choices under pressure. The pivotal ritual beat feels externally activated by the nail rather than internally wrestled, so the cost is narrated rather than dramatized in real decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Bridge-Song’s curiosity and “sculpt possibility” motive are clear, but interiority stays abstract; the final choice to raise the fiddle feels externally prompted rather than earned through contradictory impulses. No embodied cost is shown—only a lifted instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s calm is embodied in tactile handling of the money and steady voice when facing the scavenger, but interior contradiction is muted; the final “peace” feels more declared than earned by visible cost. The father’s regret is summarized rather than dramatized, limiting generational tension. Still, micro-choices (tucking money, dissuading the man) align with the stated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers trembling with anticipation”), but the shift from chronicler to self-healer is asserted more than dramatized; the telegram and stars act on her rather than forcing a visible micro-choice with cost. The final renunciation of silent burden is credible yet compressed, lacking a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eira’s interior contradiction—warlike serenity masking self-loathing—drives every beat; the seed’s glow forcing “I failed” is earned by prior guilt. Embodied emotion (hands clenched, boots sinking) is specific, though “warlike serenity” itself edges label-speak. Micro-choice to unbend in the vortex visibly costs her guarded stance, creating Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her roots…tingled”), but the “root-bound” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; her choices are internally consistent yet the covenant’s personal cost to her remains abstract until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. reverent caretaker—are embodied in her micro-choices (planting, carving, confronting her shadow-self), but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she felt the weight of it all”). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost: perpetual servitude in the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for past glory while fearing vulnerability—is embodied in tactile micro-choices and peaks in the folding of the speaker grille; the renunciation feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliara’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“hands trembling with a mix of fear and excitement”), but the haunted ambitions remain thematic rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, and the mentor’s spirit functions as a gentle guide rather than pressure. The final peace feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the creel and the orb shows embodied motive—but the “preserve wonder” drive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. The contradiction she accepts is stated rather than enacted in scene; we see her think about identity as flux, yet no moment of genuine struggle or flaw-driven error complicates her choice. The earned stasis is credible, but the cost feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative but generic; the “bridge” epiphany arrives as summary rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of accepting the crown—she simply “steps back into the tunnels.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical map-tracing vs. reckless self-exposure—are embodied in the taped accordion and the trembling note she finally releases. The micro-choice to unfold her self-drawn map on the bench crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth over anesthesia. Cost is felt when the station’s silence answers her single mournful note, confirming she must proceed unmedicated. The acquaintance’s brief intrusion tests but does not dilute her interiority; his line reframes her map without hijacking agency.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Veiled dreamer’s interiority is embodied through tactile micro-choices (tightening watch grip, following hum), but her flaw—caution overpowering hope—grows rather than constrains at climax, lowering the charge slightly. Earned stasis works, yet feels lightly charted under short length.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific (mulberry ache, telepathy with plants as quirk) and her ultimate choice to weigh dream vs. empire carries cost, but her motives remain more thematic than tightly embodied; the violin usage is elegant yet doesn’t fully test her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembled,” “heart pounding”), but the traveler’s sudden wisdom feels externally supplied rather than earned through her contradictory impulses; the final renunciation is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers tracing the intricate curves”), but the forgiveness beat is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost that should drive her ascent. The final “smile” feels tidy after cosmic revelation; a sharper contradiction or lingering ache would have deepened earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the shard and attunement to wind chimes reveal a precise, character-specific lens. Motivation (“welcome nuance into certainty”) is stated rather than dramatized; we infer it only through his letter-writing, so the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the shift from doubt to acceptance is narrated rather than enacted. Still, the final act of sealing the shard in the letter earns a modest micro-choice that forecloses further intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the backwards-aging trait remains abstract; no bodily contradiction or micro-choice is driven by it. The withheld-truth motive is clear, yet the climactic reveal feels pre-decided rather than wrestled with in-scene. Cost is stated (“heart heavy”) but not dramatized through action or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands weathered by time and resolve”), and the arrowhead’s legacy is tied to a clear, escalating mission. The final renunciation—choosing stillness over motion—carries felt cost and is foreshadowed by the pulse motif. Yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, and the internal contradiction between duty and transcendence could be sharper in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Eli’s longing to find the sacred in the simple is clearly rendered, but his interior contradiction mostly skates by summary; the final belief is earned via place rather than demonstrated turns.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative but generic; the “longing he couldn’t name” is label-speak. The skeleton key tag provides a tactile anchor, yet its pull never collides with an internal contradiction that would force a costlier choice. The vow he whispers feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from competing impulses. No embodied emotion contradicts the decision, so the change registers as mild acquiescence, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tremor, deliberate dial-turning, and the coins’ glint all embody her quiet enthusiasm. Motivation (“wavelength align with purpose”) is stated early and re-anchored in each beat, but the internal contradiction between hope and doubt is more asserted than dramatized until the final coin drop. The earned cost is present: she accepts the burden of navigator, yet the flaw driving inevitable mistakes is only lightly sketched. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with minor under-dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in the dulled scythe and her tracing of the atlas; the contradictory pull between duty and love is dramatized when she chooses to name the monsters instead of reaping. The interior contradiction is present, but the final renunciation—“she would carry these names”—leans summary rather than fully dramatized cost, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    Eliard feels earnest and imposes visible costs on the page, but the internal contradiction between cosmic drive and practical repair could be sharper in a single location. Emotion is embodied rather than labeled, though self-critical interiority edges toward diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied—his boots sinking, the cool glass against his palm—but the “precisely humane” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a costly choice. The final exhibit is a renunciation of amnesia, yet the cost is communal, not personal; Elias’s own stakes feel diffuse. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene; the arc is smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her mind working like a puzzle solver”), but the sentimental trait is only asserted, never dramatized in a choice that costs her. The final beat shows earned change—she pockets the crystal and accepts her new identity—yet the cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“watcher’s burden,” “silent vow”) rather than embodied contradiction; the parachute buckle’s tactile memory anchors motive, yet the seeker’s final choice feels more declared than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, the cool jar, the spark of dormant emotion—but the “ego death survivor” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The contradictory impulse (embrace vs. destroy the duplicate brain) is staged clearly, yet the cost of integration feels abstract; the shattering of glass is more symbolic than viscerally paid. Micro-choices under pressure (gripping swords, reaching for the jar) are specific and character-bound, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s demand for embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and “receptive” trait are shown through ritualistic planting and obsessive study, but interiority stays general; the final step into the chamber is a choice without visible cost or contradiction, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s interiority is embodied—voice cracking, handle warming—but the “mournfully eager” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s homesickness and guardian identity are embodied through her sensory absorption of the garden and her refusal to abandon the library; the final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority is specific (“dimensionally homesick,” “feral instincts”), yet a few lines drift toward label-speak (“make friends with uncertainty”). Micro-choice at climax—tightening grip, steady voice—earns the Earned Stasis. Secondary character (keeper) applies direct pressure, but voice distinction is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s stoic defeat early quickly pivots to active resistance; her emotional restraint underpins the climactic act without generic epiphanies. Internal conflict is embodied in shunning resurrection for creation, cementing earned change. Backstory stays under 20 % and directly feeds present stakes. A stoic sensitivity renders mistakes without therapeutic self-labeling. Passivity is absent; every beat stems from agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the console, the shard pulsing—but the “discard assumptions” mechanic is told more than dramatized; the final peace feels slightly unearned because the cost is abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's positive resilience is repeatedly tagged but only tested once—her decision to enter the rift—where the cost is asserted (“body weakening”) more than dramatized. Interior contradiction is sketched rather than embodied; we’re told she feels “her consciousness splintering” but no contradictory impulse fights it. Still, the drive to merge timelines stays consistent, and the final image of her on her knees, “forever changed,” earns a modest credibility from all preceding gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a tug at something deep and unspoken”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the shadow-man’s warning is the only external pressure, and her final choice feels more asserted than earned. The cost—“she had changed”—is stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s shift from surface to abyssal navigation is credible, but interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“balancedly curious” stated, not shown). The anchor chain’s tactile warmth gives one embodied beat; more bodily stakes would sharpen her final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s persistence is embodied in the pulse-following beat; the “protect vulnerable voices” motive remains consistent, yet the interiority flirts with stock phrases (“mist clung like sorrow”) and the photograph feels received rather than earned through an on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s claustrophobia surfaces in visceral beats ("walls seemed to close in"); the vow to Dr. Voss keeps every move tethered. One flaw undermines full marks: her interiority drifts toward abstract paraphrase ("some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay") rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat counting, tactile memory of the shard—but the “digital ghost” remains abstract, never forcing a micro-choice that alters tactics. The final renunciation (death certificate no longer defines her) is earned, yet the ghost’s guidance feels more thematic than interpersonal pressure. Competence balanced with struggle is present, but the flaw/choice link could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s urgent need is vivid, copper veins visually reinforcing the toll. Interiority is concrete: trembling hands, blurring vision, every line of song draining life. Micro-choice—she keeps singing despite physical collapse—reveals language > life hierarchy. Cost is embodied: diamond explodes, she collapses, stakes exacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s grief-driven quest is clear, but her interiority drifts into abstract “cosmic joke” shorthand rather than embodied contradiction. The arrowhead’s pull offers one strong micro-choice; the cordless-phone command lands as external puppetry rather than earned pivot. Closure’s renunciation feels more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the locust shell and heartbeat sync are shown more than felt. No contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene; her choice to merge heartbeats arrives as serene acceptance rather than struggle. The cost—loss of the shell’s pulse—lands, yet feels pre-ordained. Still, her embodied music-making keeps her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motive—mending broken promises for his vanished sister—anchors every beat; the embodied memory of her plea sharpens the final image. Interiority is concrete (“fix what’s broken” echoes in micro-choices), yet the rebellion trait is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choice at the drop—hand trembling as he passes the bottle—earns the quiet renunciation of further action. Cost is felt in the half-full satchel and retreat into shadow, but the sister remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in calloused hands and the warmth of the fragment, but his contradictory impulses (silence vs. song) are stated rather than dramatized until the final beat. The choice to sing is credible yet arrives more as mystical compulsion than earned struggle. Still, the cost—his reclaimed voice—lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her mind humming with calculations”), but the final beat—her acceptance of guardianship—reads as a tidy epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost; the contradiction between her obsessive quest and its quiet resolution is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers traced…salt-laden breeze”), but the longing is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown until the final beat. The renunciation is present but the cost is only lightly felt. Character remains consistent and specific, yet the dream-cipher never tests her limits on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s longing is clear, but interiority drifts toward summary (“weight of untold mysteries”) rather than embodied contradiction. The lock of hair and orb momentarily spark embodied memory, yet the final release lacks a visible personal cost; her stance feels unchanged. The mother backstory is relayed rather than dramatized, muting the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and memory-loss motive are clear, but interiority drifts into summary (“her curiosity had always been her compass”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the locket moment crystallizes motive yet lacks a visible cost that forecloses any path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her backwards walk, trembling fingers, and “combative tenderness” are embodied—but motivation (“mentor resilience quietly”) is asserted more than dramatized. The single POV holds, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure. The final resolve feels earned by the annotation act, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's interior contradiction (preserving wonder vs. mortal limits) is embodied, the heirloom choice is a micro-choice under pressure, and her renunciation of conventional pruning frames the closure cost. Symbolic "pruner" tag is only lightly activated; more embodied action would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the mother-mask backstory is delivered in a single block rather than threaded through micro-choices; the final “mending herself” beat is stated rather than dramatized with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and empathy are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing grooves, frame-by-frame video comparison, deliberate excavation). The final descent into the chapel is earned by these prior actions and carries a palpable cost—she now shoulders guardianship of silence. Interiority is specific, but the “shielded openness” trait is asserted more than dramatized. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; motivation is steady rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity-driven motivation is clear, but interiority drifts toward summary (“felt a strange clarity”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice to place the globe down carries cost yet lacks prior tension between holding and releasing. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance, but emotional layering is thin under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—“driftingly alert,” “kinship with the ghost”—but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The moment of choice (encoding the ghost) is rendered as intuitive choreography rather than a visible cost-bearing decision. Her flaw (feeling unheard) is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the embodied emotion and micro-choices around the bolt plate earn a solid mid-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is consistent, but her interiority is mostly declarative (“her heart quickening,” “tears welled”). The mentor’s goggles and diary serve as emotional triggers, yet the final insight arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than a choice that costs her something tangible. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the arc is smooth affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing the brass telescope”), but the leap into the cloud feels slightly under-motivated—no prior contradiction or flaw is dramatized that makes the risk inevitable. The final smile registers as earned gratitude rather than visible cost, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s face-blindness and artistry are foregrounded, but her dramatic need—containing infinity—is relayed more by exposition than embodied stakes. Interiority vivid but could sharpen contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the dog-ear, muttering half-translations—yet her interiority drifts into stock phrases (“sociable isolation,” “diligently curious spirit”) that flatten contradiction. The final smile and echo of Thorne’s voice provide earned stasis, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally staked.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the driftwood nostalgia—but the “rhythm of repair” remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s altruism is stated, but her interiority is thin; Kael’s shift from stranger to caretaker is sketched rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page, and the “felt cost” of the restoration is diffuse. Relationships among the four allies remain generic placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—blood on porcelain, tremor in fingers—but the “doomsday clock adjuster” identity remains label; no concrete occupational detail alters tactics. Motivation (mend to avert midnight) is legible, yet the contradiction between saving the world and cherishing flaw is asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choice—pressing bleeding palm to shard—embodies cost and earns the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s reluctant duty and buried hope are embodied in tactile soil-work and pocketed weight; the nut’s pull converts passive caretaking into active guide, costing her inherited safety. Interiority is specific, but the traveler remains a cipher, muting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is specific—polymer-chemist lens on river foam—but grief is rendered in generalized therapy-speak (“quiet ache,” “adrift”). The final shift from isolation to integration is credible yet compressed; we feel the cost more in concept than in embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s quest is clear and embodied—her climb, blade-work, and final writing enact the drive to “mend fragmented narratives.” Yet the interior contradiction (why she alone can do this) and the cost of the empty vial remain asserted rather than dramatized; the blank-book payoff feels gift-wrapped rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “sandpaper rough memories” is clear and embodied through her tactile subsuming of remorse, yet interiority drifts toward summary (“her heart lighter”) rather than contradictory impulse under peak pressure. The final choice to dissolve the shard is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her pocketed weight and ascending action; her interiority is specific, but the emotional contradiction is stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—continuing to sing—earns its cost through the crowd’s response, yet the interior cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“chaotically precise” embodied in her tactile handling of shards), but the shift from archeologist-of-dreams to memory-bridge-builder is asserted more than dramatized; the final vow lands as sentiment rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “prism-minded” trait is shown through pattern-seeing rather than told, and her trembling hand at the seed shows embodied cost; yet interiority stays safe, never risking contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s empathy drives her choice to finish the sculpture, but interior contradiction stays summary-level. Embodied tension appears in the chisel’s taps, yet the interior monologue recycles gentle platitudes. Cost is legible—she loses the daylight hedgehog-gate—but the flaw that forces the mistake is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alara’s interiority is textured—her tactile worry-stone ritual and chessboard micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses (exile vs. return, silence vs. speech). The final renunciation of the king lands with felt cost, but the “beauty in the difficult” motive is stated more than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the “eclectic pacifist” label is never tested under pressure; her silence-cataloguing motive is stated rather than dramatized. The clasp-opening beat shows a micro-choice (gentle pressure → click) that aligns with her traits, yet the absence of any cost or contradiction keeps the arc safe. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a vivid but low-stakes portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s ambition and longing are sketched, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final insight is presented as received wisdom rather than earned through visible micro-choices. Sensory gift is named but never complicates action. Cost is gestured at (“emptiness”) yet never embodied or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“clutched the artifact,” “senses attuned to the planet’s whispers”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final acceptance of guardianship feels more declared than earned, lacking a visible renunciation or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive of predictive foresight is stated, but only at the end does it translate into a renunciation ("The town’s silence...failure to foresee"). Interiority is sensory-rich yet largely unconflicted; no contradictory impulse in scene undercuts her composure. The flight-engineer patch functions as a concrete cue but does not charge a self-confronting decision—she catalogs rather than grieves. Micro-choice hierarchy is implied but undramatized; the earned stasis arrives in summary retrospect.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception is embodied in color-sound—but the childhood vow is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of her final choice. The sculpted hush materializes as external validation rather than a crucible that forces her to confront a flaw or pay a price. Micro-choices under pressure are present (ringing bells, stepping back) yet feel calibrated rather than genuinely risky.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief-driven guilt underpins the quest, but her interiority slips into summarised regret rather than present-tense contradiction. The moment she lifts the flute her trembling hands externalise cost, yet earlier beats rely on exposition not micro-choice. Enough individuation to feel singular, though perfectionism reads as authorial varnish.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his fingers trembled”), but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the final shift to “threads in a larger tapestry” is earned yet slightly abstract. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost of empathy overload is more told than shown in body.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the pendant’s hum now a steady thrum, as if urging her forward”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final acceptance of the relic’s choice feels more bestowed than wrestled from flaw. Alaric’s absence is a felt void, yet it never forces a micro-choice that visibly costs her. Voice stays coherent, but the arc leans toward discovery rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the grief she absorbs from the prism lands as a visceral cost. Yet her “attentive mystic” trait is asserted more than tested—no contradictory impulse complicates her stance under pressure. The final humility feels earned, but the absence of a competing desire keeps the arc from full tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “wistful” trait is stated rather than embodied. The bead and puzzle drive her, yet her contradictory impulses remain off-stage. The final step onto the bridge is a clear renunciation, but the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s quiet determination is embodied in the forge scene and the descent, but interior contradiction is muted; the “awakening” trade remains abstract, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. The final smile is earned, yet the missing texture of what he has actually surrendered blunts the emotional sting.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“fingers tracing the cold, metallic surface”) and her motive is clear, but the shift from curiosity to cosmic guardian feels asserted rather than earned; the woman’s exposition short-circuits internal struggle. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene before the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet resolve is sketched through tactile habit (sea glass in pocket) and micro-choice (re-stacking stones), but interior contradiction remains muted; the final stance crystallizes without a felt cost on the page, keeping him just shy of high-band depth.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Herald’s interiority is vivid—laughter as embodied barometer, micro-choice of grasping the wick—but the “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the fog arrives, softening motivation clarity. Still, the final act of steering the beam carries visible cost and earns the shift from caretaker to gate-opener.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is textured—hands stained with indigo, the magnetic tug of others’ stories—but the “second-chance” heart remains abstract, never complicating his present choice. The woman’s grief is sketched with restraint, yet her decision to share is more reported than dramatized. Micro-choice: placing the wing on the table is clear, but the cost of this illumination feels diffuse rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his sigh, the warmth of brass, the pull toward the tower—but the “what trees witness” motive is stated rather than dramatized until the final paragraph, softening the cost of his renunciation. Micro-choices (picking up the sextant, turning it) are present yet feel exploratory rather than stakes-driven. The earned stasis is legible but leans summary.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid (“hands trembled,” “breath catching”) and her memory-loss flaw drives every beat. The shift from passive observer to active weaver is dramatized through song-choices that cost her the last shard of self. Yet the “communities” remain off-stage, blunting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“dust settling on the books” mirrors her quietness), but her contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is credible yet the cost is only lightly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's interiority and contradictions register ("creeping normality noticer" vs belief that ordinary hides sacred), embodied in guerrilla-garden micro-choices that visibly cost time, sweat, potential disappointment; plaque discovery tilts tactics and confirms worldview, reweighting absolution. Motivation stays legible throughout, flaws acknowledged implicitly, though renunciation is more quiet persistence than decisive foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract; the “gently meticulous” trait is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila’s steadfastness is asserted rather than embodied; her interiority is generic (“everything” stakes) and the final “rewriting rules” claim lacks prior contradiction or cost. The watch-fob shift from heirloom to weapon is declared, not dramatized through micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s skepticism is stated but never embodied in a contradictory choice; her luminous glow is ornamental. The ring’s pull triggers movement, yet the interior contradiction between doubt and calling remains summary, not dramatized under pressure. Closure is a deferred “understanding,” not an earned stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor in her charcoal-stained hand and the tactile memory of every portrait anchor her fear. The contradictory impulse—yearning to break free yet terrified of chaos—surfaces in the moment she fingers the broken lock. The final choice to paint herself feels earned because the forgotten self-portrait and note dramatize the cost of suppression. Minor slip: “auroral sorrow” is diagnostic label-speak that momentarily abstracts emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the wilt of gilded leaves under deceit—but the final choice to inscribe truth feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (wilting) but not the full crucible that forces her hand. The contradiction between her reverence for candor and the city’s compromise is embodied, yet the moment she commits to restoration arrives more as thematic necessity than earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her muteness is stated, not embodied in choice. The final smile is the only visible cost, leaving motivation more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation to silence “static” is vivid, but the interior contradiction—android nostalgia versus cold miniaturization—is dramatized more through labels than embodied micro-choice. The one beat where she steels herself by recalling roses works, yet deeper fragmentation lacks continuous pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s thrift-store eye and listening impulse drive the mailbox investigation, but interiority skews thematic summary rather than knife-edge decision; final renunciation is earned yet emotionally broad.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her contradictory impulses (“to encrypt vulnerability as strength”) are stated rather than dramatized in body or choice. The dance-deciphering beat shows embodied motive, yet the cost of that exposure is asserted, not felt. Still, her calm defiance remains consistent and individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s interiority is concrete and emotionally grounded; the pressed wildflowers and whale memory anchor his contradictory impulses. Motivation is clear and intensifies through the experiment. The final “smile” is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor: no secondary pressure from another character.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the “weight of responsibility” is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice. The final renunciation is legible yet its cost is more stated than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid—hand tightening on the seal, shame at neighbor-avoidance—but Elias remains a cipher; his “profound sadness” is label-speak without embodied cost. The final micro-choice (knocking with sugar) is earned by prior guilt and Elias’s prompt, yet the emotional price feels light for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skepticism and isolation are embodied in her tactile hesitation and the “charmed” shift is dramatized when she yields to the shell’s pull; the final weaving of memories into resilience is earned. Interiority is specific (“memory she couldn’t quite place”) and the cost—accepting custodianship—is visible. Yet the mirrored figure’s dialogue edges toward explanatory label-speak, blunting the contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; Elara’s contradictory impulses—erase vs forgive—are dramatized through the thorn’s tremor and the blank scroll. Motivation is rooted in a specific past betrayal and culminates in a credible renunciation with felt cost. The shift from bitterness to unburdened possibility is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—she seeks to understand why some people echo—but her interiority remains abstract; the “reed-blown melancholy” is stated rather than embodied. The seashell’s warmth and hum nudge her forward, yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final “quiet resolve” is credible but earned more by exposition than by visible micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse, her breath, the tremor in her chest—but her contradictory impulses remain implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final whispered naming is earned yet the cost feels gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is sensorily solid—‘smooth surface cool against her skin’ gives Elara texture—but motive to ‘uncover hidden patterns’ remains thematic assertion without visible stakes. No contradictory impulses, no on-page choice with cost; the closure is appreciative rather than renunciatory. The character read is coherent and atmosphere-anchored but not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is present but filtered through summary “story-teller” lenses (“intuition kicked into overdrive”). Her embodied reactions are briefly sketched; contradiction surfaces only in the final choice—preserve vs expose—yet feels reported rather than sweat-staked. We learn traits through efficient exposition, but no micro-choice under live pressure reveals a hierarchy of values beyond abstract resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s loneliness and visionary drive are sketched vividly, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the “variant allegiance” choice is declared, not embodied in micro-choices under pressure. His final smile feels earned, yet the cost is narrated rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his coat “patched with stories,” the remembered laughter in a buried jar—but the moment of “becoming a translator” is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied in a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—logic versus protective instinct—drives every beat; key choice to use the key’s resonance against the intruder is earned by prior setup, and the cost (retreat of hope for global harmony) is visible in the final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara embodies a quiet, focused archetype: horizon mapper fused with spiritual sculptor. Interiority stays concrete—tactile focus on frost-latticed light, pulse under cold iron—and her contradictions (urgency vs stillness) manifest only in summary rather than moment-to-moment beats under pressure, muting earned change. The renunciation on the viaduct is visible, but its emotional charge arrives in a single paragraph rather than through an escalating interior war.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is concrete (her calm exterior vs storm within), embodied action mirrors stakes (fingers tremble against journal), but the renunciation of the mentor lands with cost. Motive ("break free…") is signalled but reiterated rather than enacted; a single micro-choice pries open the compartment which changes everything, though some micro-turns feel slightly summary.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elias's doubts are sketched more than dramatized; “weeks” and “gnaw at him” summarize rather than reveal micro-choices under pressure. Clockwork heart as proxy for guilt is evocative, yet his interior contradiction at the moment he lifts the repaired heart never emerges in conflicting impulses. The change—resolve to fight the conviction—lands as a pre-packaged outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s curiosity is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a contradictory choice; the arrow tip is handled once as talisman, never reweighted under pressure. The breakthrough moment is narrated rather than dramatized, so the final “irreverent grin” feels unearned. No visible cost or renunciation closes her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s arc from observer to seeker is cleanly dramatized through concrete micro-decisions (offline bypass, memorizing coordinates) with visible contradictions—fear vs curiosity. Motivation reframes at climax, foreclosing safety with Earned Stasis. Secondary pressure from the archive opens status dynamics in brief beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation is stated early and reiterated, but interiority remains abstract; “shadow-laced” is label-only, never embodied. The decisive act of reconstitution is motivated by stated mission rather than dramatized contradiction. Micro-choices in the mirrors are observational, not pressured. Earned stasis is present but cost is generalized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“gripped reality loosely”), but her contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final shift to acceptance is signaled rather than earned through a visible micro-choice. The parasol’s symbolic weight is well-tracked, yet its role in her decision is ornamental, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“cool air brushing against her skin”), but the shift from reflection to decision lacks a visible micro-choice that would crystallize her transformation; the burned letter remains more symbol than catalyst for action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “strangely honest” trait is dramatized only once (she consecrates even when unobserved), but interiority is otherwise generic; the final bow to the prophet feels dutiful rather than costly. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the mask and cloak remain ornamental. The lineage duty is asserted, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-rooted mission is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of photographs; the interior contradiction between “collective healing” and private loss is present but stays summary-level, never crystallizing into a visible on-page cost or irreversible choice. The final stance—hope replacing weight—feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reticence and reverence for language are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the crystal, shallow breath). The interior contradiction—hope versus the weight of loss—surfaces in the moment he accepts the crystal’s death as the price for renewal. Motivation remains steady rather than intensifying, and the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness and tidal longing are embodied in every micro-choice—chalk line, driftwood placement, final release—creating a credible arc from grasping to acceptance. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The final renunciation (letting the chalk fall) carries visible cost and is earned by the preceding search. Only the “prophet” label feels slightly ornamental rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “luminous ache” and tactile precision anchor her—but the leap from “clock hand = escape velocity” to dismantling time itself is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet slightly under-motivated by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s kindness is embodied in micro-choices (calling Claire, adjusting melody), but her interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“hymning the mundane”) rather than live contradiction; the decisive act is clear yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet deliberation is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing grooves, etching runes—yet interiority occasionally drifts into explanatory summary (“a mystery that had eluded scholars”). The mentor’s absence is felt as pressure, but the vanishing itself is told more than dramatized, muting the relational crucible. Final renunciation of the key’s purpose lands with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight of the changeling’s baby tooth resting heavy against her hip”), but the moment of surrendering her “certainty stone” feels slightly abstract—more label than lived cost. The contradiction between skepticism and yearning is present yet not fully dramatized in a single irreversible beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s vow against fire and her tactile ritual with the glass are vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“she had sworn…”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the final choice to leave the grotto is gentle yet feels foregone, lacking a palpable new cost or internal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the amber pendant anchors her contradictory impulses. Yet her final shift from guarded to open relies more on Kai’s gentle presence than on a visible cost she herself pays. The “quietly proactive” trait is shown in micro-choices, but the decisive beat feels externally nudged rather than internally compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority feels consistent and specific; conflicted stance plays through micro-moves—“part of her wanted to turn away…”—but interior monologue leans into therapeutic cadence (“felt an indelible mark”) just as stakes spike. Final choice—placing shell among others—lands as genuine renunciation backed by prior beats; cost reads emotionally but could be made more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is stated early and consistent, yet her interiority remains largely declarative (“she knew,” “she felt”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure complicates her stance; the climax is received passively via song fragments. The vine’s transformation is external spectacle, not earned through her flawed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s patience is embodied in micro-gestures and her interiority is consistent, yet the heartbeat-to-map motive remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “peripherally focused” trait shows in how he notices light angles—but the story never dramatizes a contradictory impulse; fixing the timer is a straight-line obsession. The final “peace” is asserted rather than embodied, so the cost feels abstract. Still, the embodied humming and tactile handling of gears give him specificity beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her compulsion to bear others’ burdens versus the calcifying cost to her own soul—is embodied in the tightening grip on the lamp burner. The final choice to weave her own pattern is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the fissure in her calcified layers). The figure’s pressure crystallizes her stance, but the figure itself remains too archetypal to deepen status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s grief feels embodied (hands tracing wood, deliberate tea pour), but her interior stays mostly smooth. One sharp moment—“knew she had contained not just his memory, but her own resilience” finally ties trait to cost, yet most contradiction arrives paraphrased, not dramatized scene-by-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—regret as “second skin,” the ghost as “shadow of eroded ambitions”—and her tactile micro-choices (prying the wheel, pressing it to her ear) embody the contradiction between paralysis and hope. The final beat crystallizes her stance with felt cost: she steps forward, accepting the weight of fragments yet reopening possibility. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are embodied in tactile micro-choices—picking up the sextant, redirecting air and light—so motive stays visible. Interiority is concrete (“puzzle out new equations for hope”) but edges toward diagnostic label-speak, softening contradiction. The final renunciation (leaving the terminal with the sextant in pocket) carries a felt cost of letting the resurrected moment die again, earned by prior causality. Still, the emotional layering is thin; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the “emptiness” mirrored in the blank clock face—but the buried dream is told more than dramatized; the final reconciliation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (unearth lies) is vivid, and her interiority shows contradictory impulses when she weighs salvaging the barge vs rushing ahead. The sundial glow and pulsing heartbeat tie object to embodied stakes. A micro-choice—salvaging the chest—earns redefinition of tactics. Cost is legible, though momentary, limiting the height of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile attention to rope and glass feels specific—but her motivation remains abstract (“preserve ancient methods”) and never collides with a visible cost or contradiction; the final smile resolves tension without exposing a flaw or renunciation, so the arc feels gentle rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elderly woman's wait embodied without diagnostic clichés; traveler’s interiority vivid—her micro‐choice to hand over the notebook and accept second thread is earned. Only the “lonesome splendor” tag skirts sentimentality. Otherwise character logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s duality—intellectual rigor against emotional fragility—is embodied in micro-choices (quaking hands with the egg). His renunciation of the machine’s guarantee offers earned stasis; the cost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—atonement vs. self-forgiveness—are embodied in the tactile grafting scene; the final renunciation of inherited guilt is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the sand-stained hands and the coin left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes glowed faintly”), but her contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized; the final choice feels foreshadowed rather than earned by prior micro-choices. No visible cost is dramatized on the page at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—"weight of generations in her soul"—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the gear’s glow responds to her, yet no embodied micro-choice reveals how the shift costs her. The final “radiant glow” lands as earned stasis, but the absence of a visible personal price keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Intricate, embodied interiority anchors Elara; her chisel-in-hand micro-choice (“began to retrace”) pivots from paralysis to carving. The contradiction—grief as space not shape—earns her final stance. No dialogue with on-page character, so relationship crucible n/a; spectral mentor pressure felt solely via memory. Ghost guidance works as abstract constraint rather than active, embodied stakes; slight motivational opacity in closing beats where Tomas simply “fades.”

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s ethical diligence and incremental absolution motive are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—winding, carving, conversing—creating a meaningful before/after arc that earns his earned peace. Renouncing grand gestures in favor of quiet reconfiguration shows credible character growth with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his fingers “tenderly organized around a trowel” and the tapestry decoding is tactile—but the final beat is a soft epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost is paid, so the arc feels slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“weight of possibility,” “hands trembled”), but the contradiction between fear and hope is stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—rolling the scroll and walking away—earns its cost through prior causality, yet the shift from doubt to resolve feels slightly smoothed rather than struggled.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s motivation is stated early and reinforced, but interiority stays generic (“heart quickening,” “resolve firm”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final stance is asserted rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief and ritual impulse are embodied in the velvet pouch and trembling palm, but interior contradiction is muted; the “mirage of safety” never collides with a counter-desire strong enough to complicate the scattering. The final beat of acceptance is credible yet feels foregone, lacking a visible cost that would deepen the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s obsession with the cog and his desire to “preserve ancient methods” are stated repeatedly, but the interior contradiction between clinging to the past and the possibility of rebuilding is only summarized, not dramatized in a single decisive beat. The final ascent to the ruins is motivated by external news rather than an internal pivot, so the cost feels external rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, but interiority drifts into generic “vanishing arts” rhetoric; the final choice to “sing to listen” is earned yet its cost is stated more than felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the rosette functions as talisman rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her fingers brushing soil, the warmth of the fruit—but the “taste memories” gift is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in scene. The pruning micro-choice is clean and forecloses fear, yet the grandmother’s wisdom is paraphrased, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness is stated but never dramatized; her interiority is generic (“heart raced,” “smiled”) and the final “whispered the riddle’s words” is summary, not embodied choice. No contradictory impulses appear on the page; the descent and orb-touch feel inevitable rather than wrestled with. The lacquer box and key act on her rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet intensity is embodied (hands on the shard, breath caught by wind), but the interior shift remains a tad tidy—the “found calling” resolves too gently without a visible cost or contradiction left palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s telepathy is embodied through concrete thought-threading beats; Elara’s interiority shows fragile certainty colliding with doubt. The final renunciation—testing the serum instead of rushing home—earns its cost via prior telepathic warning. Minor slip: Elara’s “frantic” label is summary, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interior contradictions (grim vs. optimistic) are lived in scene through dice rolls and the acceptance of loss; the chipped/pristine dice mirror her split and force the renunciation that ends the quest. Voice is individual, yet occasional abstract summarizing (“texture of that fleeting instant”) keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are embodied in her nightly climbs and steady brushwork, but the shift from self-soothing to communal mission is asserted more than dramatized; the final calm feels slightly unearned because the cost of her new purpose is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of the lens and the bread, but interiority drifts into summary (“she realized then”) rather than simultaneous contradiction; the final stance crystallizes with cost yet feels slightly pre-announced.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “neatly inventive mind” and tactile dismantling of the yoyo show embodied obsession—but the final beat leans on abstract awe rather than a contradictory impulse acted upon, so the cost feels observed rather than wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s fear-of-forgetting motive is clear and embodied in the clasp, but interiority drifts toward label-speak (“fear feeds on doubt”) and the advisor remains a disembodied voice rather than a crucible. The final unbosoming lands with cost, yet the shift from terror to freedom feels compressed rather than earned through visible micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward’s interiority is vivid—bare feet on driftwood, mallet “warm, alive”—but his contradictory impulses (restlessness vs. harmony) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of restlessness is earned by the musical sequence, yet the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing symbols, clutching the whistle—but interiority drifts into summary (“her resolve unyielding”) rather than contradictory impulse. Mentor absence is backstory, not crucible; no second character on page. Final acceptance of task is credible renunciation yet cost is more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive—“to rescue truth from a pit of lies”—is vivid and sustained, but interiority leans summary (“this ability that drove her”) rather than embodied contradiction. The moment at the ledger (“the truth is a seed”) is a beat, yet the final decision stays conceptual; no single micro-choice visibly costs her an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid (“heart… pounded with uncommon urgency”) and his stoic sensitivity surfaces in the deliberate restraint of his actions. Yet the shift from surveyor to “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the cost of that new identity is stated, not embodied. The final beat—walking away without looking back—earns a modest Earned Stasis, but the emotional ledger feels more declared than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers brushing the spines,” “dappled resolve”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final choice to press the stamp feels inevitable rather than costly, so the Earned Stasis is only partially felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s grief is embodied in origami cranes and unfinished lanterns; his interior contradiction—crafting to escape vs. needing to feel—drives every beat. The micro-choice to unfold the crane at the altar crystallizes the arc with visible cost (abandoning control). Secondary pressure from Lira is brief but forces stance shift. Motivation stays rooted and intensifies to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zara’s grief and drive are embodied in tactile detail (ash-scented dress, crystal touch), but interiority drifts toward abstract “potential pools” and “unfiltered awakening” rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance crystallizes with cost—she accepts being reshaped—but the turn is more declared than dramatized through micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear—recover the matrix chip—but interiority is generic (“his mind racing”). The “perpetually surprised” trait is label-only; it never constrains or enables a choice. A single micro-choice (inserting the chip) earns the ending, yet lacks embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s contradiction—crafting false histories while hoarding truth—drives every beat: the watch hand clenched “biting into his palm” embodies the conflict; his trembling legs and conscious refusal to add more lies fulfill the earned stasis. Interiority is textured but drifts toward abstract guilt therapy-speak in the driftwood sequence, muting unique motive.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile grounding with the drawer pull and moon-phase fixation reveal a consistent, thoughtful persona—but Kael remains a cipher; the final concession feels more symbolic than earned from visible internal struggle on his part.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—“fingers tracing the worn surface,” legs wobbling—and her contradictory impulse (clinging to broken compass vs. trusting utilitarian poles) plays out in scene. The final renunciation—tucking the compass away—occurs on-page with felt cost. Reflection exceeds the 20% cap and is somewhat expository; it tilts stance but also flattens micro-choice density. Interior voice is distinctive, yet minor therapy-speak drift (“align her heart and her actions”).

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—memory wipe yet persistent guilt—surfaces only in brief summary; the lake prompts surrender more than choice. Final renunciation of the ball is gesture, not crucible. Emotions lean abstract (“jaded wonder”) without embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is luminous but drifts at times toward abstraction (“weight of centuries” rather than felt memory); Elara’s final micro-choice to release the bond and rebind with herself lands with visible glow yet lacks earlier bodily stakes to maximize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the stone in her chest—but the “willingly perplexed” trait is stated more than dramatized. The nephew’s absence is felt, yet the relationship remains off-stage, so the crucible effect is muted. The final micro-choice (cradling the saucer) is earned and carries cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifism is stated but never tested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The “shadow work” remains abstract, so her interior arc feels asserted rather than earned. Final “ghostly resolve” lands as mood, not visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“toes sinking into cool grains”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract—no moment shows her simultaneously pulled toward and away from the detour. The final release of the bugs is emotionally resonant yet feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with; the cost is poetic but not dramatized on her body or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers brushing the quill holder, her pulse quickening at the key—but the “calmly inventive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to activate the cradle feels slightly under-motivated because Thorne’s hesitation is too brief to crystallize her risk. The mentor gift anchors backstory without violating BRR, yet the cost of betrayal is named rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his yearning for pattern and fear of the curse is dramatized in the moment he scatters the dust. The final smile and steady steps show earned change with visible cost. One notch off 9+ because the “ancient voice” remains off-stage exposition rather than a dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—embodied emotion (“trembling hands,” “furiously tranquil gaze”) and contradictory impulses (fear/hope) are present. The final choice to write uncensored is earned by the map’s confrontation of past scars. Yet the backstory blocks (≈25% of text) slow momentum and the “cartographer of scars” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motive is stated but not embodied in micro-choices; the mechanical arm is decorative rather than constraining. The final renunciation (“destination…within him”) is earned by dialogue logic, not by visible cost. Interiority is abstract (“dignified chaos”) rather than embodied contradiction. Relationship pressure with Mara is hinted but never crystallizes into a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “molting” is announced, not dramatized; we never see a prior self or feel cost when he claims permanence. Clara’s quiet strength stays abstract—no contradictory impulse under pressure. The bond is stated (“friendship sparked”) rather than tested; no status shift or shared risk alters it. Endurance is asserted (“this self was here to stay”) without a beat that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her bleeding fingers, the frozen clock—but the “strategically creative” trait is asserted rather than dramatized until the film-reel plan, so the final choice feels lightly earned. The contradictory impulse (cling vs. release) is present yet muted; cost is felt but not sharply embodied in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is stated but never embodied; she “feels” and “knows” rather than acts until the final beat. The creature’s riddle is the only moment of contradictory impulse, and even that is resolved in a single declarative sentence. No interior contradiction is dramatized; the seed is lifted without visible cost to her identity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s slow speech and bonsai past are embodied in his tactile study of compass and lace, but interior contradiction is muted; the final renunciation feels more thematic than personally costly. The letters give him a surrogate voice rather than forcing him to confront his own unspoken apology. Still, his measured micro-choices (tracing lace, reading aloud) align with motive and create a credible shift to release.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "capturing impermanent" art versus seeking fixed truth, but apprentice's captivity lacks embodied reaction cost; micro-choices like frost-tracing reveal hierarchy of values without over-rationalization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "thoughts felt muffled" versus determined action; embodied emotion via bone-resonant tuning fork vibrations avoids therapy-speak. Final realization earns renunciation of sound-seeking with visible cost in reframed worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority leans poetic but lacks embodied contradiction; "inadvertently stubborn" trait stated yet untested in action during fragment search. Emotional shift at closure ("weariness lifting") feels earned but summarized rather than layered through micro-choices under pressure.

    Clear motivation but interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "gently persistent" label appears twice without embodied cost during key reveals like the widow encounter, weakening micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation to find "unused love" drives tangible choices (kneeling, following sparks) with embodied cost; past-life memories avoid therapy-speak via concrete temple/lover imagery but slight tell in "memories flooded her mind" slightly flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority shows concrete texture through photographs and maze design, but "texture of time" motivation remains abstract without embodied cost. Flaws (passive agency during transformation) complicate choices credibly, though the final "discovered herself" risks unearned epiphany. Micro-choices lack visible trade-offs during pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction (chains as burden/strength) drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion via "trembling hands" and "breath steady" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of chains earned by prior causality but lacks deeper flaw confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority shows embodied emotion (collecting absence "as fragile glass") but "battered marvel" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, triggering penalty. Contradictory impulses under pressure are underdeveloped despite clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation remains abstract ("press ear against destiny’s door") without contradictory impulses; diagnostic label-speak in Elara’s "piece of someone’s soul" line triggers -0.5 penalty. Micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction ("afraid of vulnerability" yet crafting safe zones) embodied through glassblowing process; micro-choices like placing bookmark in sphere earn closure. Slight tell in "safe zones" motivation lacks deeper friction with past silence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Diagnostic label "vulnerability is not weakness. It was power" in peak beat triggers penalty; internal conflict lacks layered contradiction despite credible closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied obsession but lacks contradictory impulses in action; final endurance lacks visible cost despite rich interiority. No trade-offs shown for "mildly obsessed" trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority avoids therapy-speak but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; "thoughts unraveling" is abstract embodiment. Micro-choices absent during climax where stakes peak. Motivation clear but closure choice lacks visible cost beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. desire for transparency) act in scene through micro-choices like tracing doodles, but Kian’s sudden thaw lacks sufficient causal buildup—his shift feels earned only by Elara’s action, not mutual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority rich but epiphany unmotivated; "mended deception" appears as diagnostic label without embodied cost during polishing ritual. Contradictory impulses absent—Elias merely reflects rather than struggles under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong motivation drives action but internal contradiction lacks embodiment; "icy warmth" stated not shown through micro-choices during crisis. Micro-turn at lever-pull lacks value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority leans abstract ("profound sense of peace") without contradictory impulses; motivation clear but lacks visible struggle or blind spots complicating choices. Micro-choices like tracing patterns feel reactive rather than revealing value hierarchies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction shown through botanical focus vs truth-haunting, but "fault-tolerant oracle" trait remains abstract label without altering tactics; micro-choices like smudging ink reveal values, yet swallowed truth motivation lacks embodied friction until closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction (skepticism vs inherited belief) drives choices, but "restless need to appraise" veers into diagnostic label-speak; recklessness lacks concrete manifestation beyond cautious movement.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's motivation ("nurture lifelong wonder") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; Finn's fear/fascination shows embodied emotion yet shifts too neatly to "cautious exuberance" without messy internal conflict. Diagnostic phrase "spark of wonder" triggers -0.4 penalty for label-only feeling.

    Interiority relies on labels ("bitterly sweet truth," "spark of determination") without embodied contradiction; final realization lacks visible struggle against flaws. Diagnostic phrasing in peak beats triggers penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interior contradiction is abstract ("scars can sing") rather than embodied; diagnostic phrasing in climax ("scars... sang") triggers -0.4 penalty. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack tangible stakes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's "luminous skeptic" trait drives concrete choices (doubt→curiosity shift), but the reflection moment lacks embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs wonder) shown through micro-choices like pocketing the first shard.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interior contradiction evident (light vs. consumption) but micro-choices under pressure lack specificity; "heart quickened" is label-only feeling without embodied cost during the pivotal gear connection moment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied struggle ("How could one capture weight of loss in marble?") and Tomas’ spectral guidance directly shapes her breakthrough; avoids epiphany clichés by rooting insight in ribbon/butterfly observation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority rooted in calloused hands and routine, but transformation lacks contradictory impulses; "searing reverie" risks therapeutic abstraction. Epiphany feels earned yet slightly convenient without visible struggle against his solitary nature during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation ("to understand stories") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "blithe" trait contradicts melancholic actions without visible tension. No micro-choices under pressure—Elias decodes uninterrupted, missing embodied struggle with the tapestry’s emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior contradiction under pressure is vague; "weight of possibility" lacks embodied specificity. "Groundedly imaginative" trait stated but not demonstrated through micro-choices during quill-writing climax.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation "teach dust to tell stories" is vivid but interior contradiction lacks depth; embodied excitement ("hand moving frantically") strong, yet final resolve feels unearned without prior struggle against fatigue or doubt during transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction in embracing fragility while seeking closure is embodied through ash scattering, but "mirage of safety" reflection lacks micro-choice integration with the rocking chair's stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority strong with concrete embodiment ("clutched cog," "abrasive calm masking turmoil"), but Lira’s shift from mockery to alliance lacks sufficient motivation. Kael’s change occurs off-page during "weeks turned into weeks," violating emotional progression realism with unearned hope. Contradictory impulses (logic vs. madness) act simultaneously early but fade during pivotal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority leans abstract ("traveled stillness," "unlearning hatred") with diagnostic phrasing; embodied contradictions in Elara's resolve lack dramatization despite strong motivation. Students remain underdeveloped props.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—doubt versus hope—drives the pruning action with embodied cost ("tingling in fingertips"), but grandmother’s wisdom risks thematic echo without sufficient friction in her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction (isolation vs. duty to truth) drives choices, but motivation "preserve wonder" lacks deep conflict; embodied emotion strong in descent/orb touch yet micro-choices remain linear without genuine struggle against the trait's curse.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias sanctifying objects while being displaced himself, with embodied cost in the key's transformation. "Inadvertently profound" told rather than shown early weakens setup. Micro-choice at the rock crystallizes his hierarchy of values through tactile ritual. Flaw: "creeping normality noticer" feels like a label not lived experience until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's micro-choice to test further shows contradictory impulses (certainty vs. caution) with embodied cost, but Liora's passivity risks undermining interiority despite strong telepathic constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority rich but "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" verge on label-speak; the chipped die's loss forces authentic contradiction between holding/letting go with embodied cost in the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction in "methodically hopeful" trait shown through nightly ritual versus passive vision reception; micro-choices like ink selection reveal painter's specificity, but vision-induced transformation lacks sufficient struggle against exhaustion to fully earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction (hope/fear in “rosewater dread”) manifests physically through lens-induced shadows and whispers, but the bread-baking climax lacks tangible struggle—her success feels unearned as no opposing force actively resists revival. Micro-choices like kneading dough while observing the lens’s glow reveal value hierarchy, yet the absence of a concrete setback weakens endurance credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interiority remains surface-level ambition without deeper conflict beyond "unease." Final choice earned but micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's embodied fear manifests through the clasp's flickering images, but "fear of being forgotten" lacks contradictory impulses during the climax. Advisor's shadowy status shifts remain superficial despite the "repulsive allure" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; Leeward’s resolve is unwavering with no visible internal struggle. Micro-choices absent—his actions flow without hesitation, missing the friction required for earned change. Embodied emotion ("mallet felt warm") is strong but insufficient without deeper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear but interior contradiction lacks embodied demonstration; "quietly driven" trait remains label without visible cost during the shell-taking climax where resolve should waver.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s "emotionally rational" trait lacks embodied tradeoffs; her smooth archive discovery avoids genuine struggle. Contradictory impulses ("truth vs. humanity of lies") emerge only at closure without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interior contradiction (professional detachment vs urgency) is embodied in silt-covered arches and raw hands, but "stoically sensitive" label and "hushed blaze" cliché trigger diagnostic slip penalties; journal discovery hardens resolve without showing competing impulses in the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; "dappled resolve" stated not embodied through micro-choices. Final discovery lacks visible cost—no struggle with truth's implications despite "doubts lingered" setup. Interiority leans abstract during pivotal map alignment ("mind racing with possibilities").

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s embodied grief (calloused hands vs. hollow craft) and micro-choice to unfold the crane. No therapy-speak; the shadow realization emerges through tactile action, not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vivid but "unfiltered awakening" borders on diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses (survivor/seeker) earned through crystal study, though motivation ("find unused potential") remains abstract without concrete prior causality anchoring the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority remains abstract ("strange resonance") without embodied contradiction; "perpetually surprised" trait is decorative label rather than driving micro-choices under pressure. Flaws lack compounding effect—Kael faces no meaningful struggle despite "genuine struggle" requirement. No visible cost scales to length beyond vague self-realization.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (professional complicity vs moral reckoning) drive micro-choices like clutching the watch hand; embodied guilt avoids therapy-speak but "relentless tide" metaphor slightly abstracts emotion at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interior contradiction ("apology and forgiveness") manifests in tactile micro-choices (turning drawer pull) and embodied conflict ("cold air biting lungs"). Kael's silent nod reveals earned endurance with visible cost. Slight interiority gaps in high-pressure beats prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority shows embodied contradiction (compass spinning vs. pole navigation), but "backlash of regrets" drifts into diagnostic label-speak without immediate physical cost. Final choice to tuck compass earns closure through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction ("clean slate seeker" vs shadowed past) drives choice to enter lake; embodied panic at sinking baseball reveals authentic struggle. Epiphany about empathy feels slightly abstract without deeper prior friction with the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear but interior contradiction feels abstract; "weight of centuries" tells rather than embodies struggle. Micro-choices lack visible trade-offs during the conjuring climax, weakening the earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("stone in her chest," tracing the saucer's fracture) and micro-choices (unfastening brooch as symbolic shedding). Final endurance—returning with presence—is causally earned through the vision's cost. Slight tidiness in epiphany prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction embodied in gravity shifts; "ghostly resolve" crystallizes earned endurance with cost. No therapy-speak despite spiritual theme.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation "texture of transformation" lacks embodied conflict; epiphany feels unearned as contradictory impulses (surrender vs. preservation) aren't dramatized during the bottle release. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (duty vs revolution) drive credible choices with visible cost in Thorne confrontation, but his underdeveloped motivation weakens the stakes crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as "sacred patterns" motivation remains abstract despite clear goal. Diagnostic label "precognitively cursed" dominates peak moments without visible struggle against the curse's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority richly embodied in map interaction, but motivation for censorship remains abstract despite "lifelong quest" claims; scar names lack specific causal weight for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("diplomatically fierce" vs. precision pursuit) drives micro-choices like the mechanical arm's deliberate arc during the pivotal "test your theory" challenge. Final renunciation of destination-seeking earns closure through embodied cost in the "chaos became dignified" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation clear but molting trait remains ornamental; no contradictory impulses or earned change with visible cost. Clara’s healing feels unearned without specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vividly embodied (fingers bleeding from piano playing), but "strategically creative" trait lacks on-page testing under pressure; micro-choices remain passive rather than revealing value hierarchies during the reel immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "heart steady" during climax feels emotionally sanitized without conflicting impulses. No visible struggle between duty and fear despite high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s slow speech as both burden and gift, embodied when he “weighs each word” like bonsai care. Epiphany avoids therapy-speak through visceral action—reading letters aloud as tides dissolve them—making “hue of letting go” earned. Slight over-tidiness in resolution risks undermining flaw authenticity.
