    Elena's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices (settling onto stone, studying the ledger, comparing frost patterns) reveal priorities under pressure. The transformation from "artist who worked only for approval" to someone "steadily adaptive" is declared rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The poisoning backstory anchors motivation but the patron's death ("his own poison somehow found his cup") reads convenient rather than causally earned through Elena's action. Internal conflict exists but operates more through reflection than simultaneous competing drives.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaret's interiority is richly embodied through thermal perception and silence. Her motivation—rebuilding lost sound through temperature data—is particular and drives consistent micro-choices (selecting specimens, striking tuning forks, transcribing thermal readings). The final smile and choice to "keep writing" demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost (acceptance of permanent silence, commitment to a new language). Minor weakness: the backstory weight (~25%) anchors well but edges toward exposition; however, the ocean trauma primes every on-page choice and the piece meets the BRR exception tests.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ezra's characterization is solid: his inadvertent stubborn trait drives his refusal to abandon the lens, and his forty years of undertaking provides grounded authority. The underwater funeral work shows embodied action ("learned their names from the waterlogged records"), though his internal contradiction could be sharper—he moves from weary to purposeful without much visible struggle. The final shift to accepting stillness feels earned by the seven-night labor, but the exhaustion-to-purpose arc trends slightly mechanical. Minor: "inadvertently stubborn in ways he never recognized in himself" tells rather than dramatizes the trait through an on-page micro-choice early.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is consistently motivated by community preservation and shows internal texture through her "gentle persistence" approach. Yusuf provides good secondary pressure with his suspicion balanced against need-to-belong. However, the teenage cousins and elders remain functionally interchangeable, and Mira's interiority often slides into conceptual-level reflection ("survival meant more than food—it meant binding the old to the young") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to continue the runs feels ordained rather than tested by a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei-Lin's interiority shows spiritual curiosity and grief-pattern recognition, but her agency remains observational until the encounter. The old woman's transformation is dramatized through breath patterns, yet her interior contradiction (daughter's forgiveness) is asserted rather than earned through conflicting impulses. The past-life monk backstory provides motivation but doesn't constrain present choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears in the woman's weeping, but Mei-Lin's own struggle or cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—she seeks to understand time's texture to escape retrocognitive trapping—but the final transformation into temporal fabric reads more like mystical dissolution than a choice with visible psychological cost. The progression from maze designer to temporal weaver is poetic but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would lift this into higher bands. Her daughter and husband exist as memory-objects rather than relational pressure, and the ending forecloses suffering without dramatizing what she surrenders beyond her physical form. The retrocognitive condition is labeled and described but never constrains a tactical choice on the page before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her strategic patience shows in the key-decoding sequence, but her internal contradiction is thin—she moves through beats with competence that rarely wavers or costs her emotionally. The scout's reversal feels convenient rather than earned by prior friction; his war is told ("duty against desperation") rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The chains as "familiar as her own heartbeat" recur but function more as atmospheric motif than a constraint that shapes her tactics with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interior world is distinctly rendered through her synesthetic perception and the weight of her mother's betrayal. The motivation to understand trust-breaking is embodied in the work itself, not merely stated, and her final weeping into her helmet shows contradictory impulses—anger, grief, and a desire to help. The decision to send the device carries visible cost (emotional reopening of the wound) and feels earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for the workshop memory block, which reads slightly expository rather than fully integrated into present pressure, though it does anchor the glass fragment's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—liberating hoarded beauty—but her competence is never tested by genuine struggle. The fifteen-year backstory and mother's paintings provide context but the perfect heist unfolds without meaningful internal contradiction or cost. The final emotional beat with her mother's presence reads as unearned comfort rather than a confrontation with ambiguity. Micro-choices exist (the decoy swap) but no visible trade-off forces her to forfeit something that matters on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and rooted in her glassblowing craft, with embodied gestures like touching the bookmark and pulling the lever. The self-narration device serves character function but occasionally flattens genuine contradiction—her "theatrical loneliness" is articulated rather than lived in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to descend the mountain is motivated by accumulated pressure, though the renunciation of solitude could carry more visible micro-hesitation to earn the cost. Father-abandonment backstory anchors present stance but occupies substantial wordcount without altering a present micro-choice until the pocketing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marla's internal contradictions (phobias vs. stunt work) are established but her choices feel predetermined rather than wrestled through on the page. The final confrontation shows her "lowering defenses intentionally" and understanding "vulnerability's power," but this insight arrives as assertion rather than embodied discovery through micro-choices under pressure. Sandra's motivation (sibling rivalry) reads as efficient backstory rather than a living internal contradiction that complicates her present stance. The cast is cleanly managed, but emotional progression leans on therapeutic framing ("firmly adaptive," "transformative") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"mildly obsessed with understanding" is embodied through the three-day climb and her steady resolve in darkness. Her micro-choices (touching the flaking gold, tracing the map with bleeding fingers) reveal hierarchy of values. However, the final smile and confidence feel slightly unearned; the cost of eternal night is declared but not felt as internal contradiction or loss. No secondary character pressures her directly, so relational bullets don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit-7's interior life is rendered through borrowed voices and fragmented consciousness, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The decision to play the violin and the acceptance of eternal return show choice under pressure, but the amalgamated consciousness risks feeling like a convenient device rather than a lived constraint. Embodied contradiction exists (machine that wonders vs. janitor that sweeps), though the final choice feels more resigned than costly. The "remarkably composed" attribute appears as descriptor rather than creating visible friction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal state shows some contradictions—drawn by habit yet carrying the lens as "protection"—but her final choice to give away the lens feels somewhat unmotivated beyond thematic necessity. Theo's accused past and ongoing mistrust are told rather than shown in present pressure; his "shoulders loosened" declares rather than embodies the thaw. The exchange of lens and ticket reads as symbolic choreography more than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the line "their eyes met with the weight of entire conversations" tells rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Esther's interior life is richly embodied through concrete action—polishing marbles, tending vines—and her late-life pragmatism shapes the choice to finally tell Elena the truth. The granddaughter's resignation creates genuine pressure, and Esther's decision to share her collection carries visible cost (dismantling the legend she's sheltered behind for decades). Minor: Elena's interiority remains thin, serving primarily as a foil, and the transformation from despair to agency happens quickly in the final third. The marble-polishing ritual and the myth-busting conversation both feel earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is consistent and character-specific, grounded in her mechanic's sensibility ("feeling the mechanically warm vibration…through her bones"). Her motivation to prove the sideways-time theory is clear, though the stakes feel more intellectual than visceral—there's no moment where we see her struggle with doubt or cost beyond Vasquez's dismissal. The final choice to present findings reads as inevitable rather than a renunciation or difficult trade-off; the "soft and certain and irreversible" awakening lacks the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear and her obsession well-established, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—we get "insomnia and obsession" as labels rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to retrieve the documents feels inevitable but lacks a visible on-page cost or internal friction; she simply completes the task she came to do. Emotional progression is steady but doesn't degrade or layer under stress in ways that reveal hierarchy of values. The ghost relationship is evocative but one-sided, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassandra's interior is well-rendered with embodied contradiction ("truth in her chest shifted, demanding acknowledgment") and her choice to withhold the vision rather than report it is motivated by consistent self-preservation. The fault-tolerant oracle design provides compelling internal logic for her hedging behavior. Minor weakness: the reflection on her survival strategy ("by occupying margins") drifts slightly abstract in the middle third without immediate micro-choices. The final decision to carry the weight privately feels earned by the fever-driven setup and her established pattern of distribution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation is sustained and particularized through concrete micro-choices (touching the amber bead, photographing evidence, sitting against the wall in exhaustion). The discovery process dramatizes his internal shift from skeptical explorer to someone accepting the weight of evidence. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak and stays embodied ("understanding settling into his bones with terrible weight"). Minor weakness: the seventeen-year carrying of "swallowed truths" reads slightly abstract and the final resolve ("He would make them count") edges toward declaration rather than embodied choice, but the prior tactile engagement with the beads earns the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistent and particular—silence as accumulation, "cupping water" that slips through—but her choices lack meaningful pressure or cost. The piece offers observation and philosophical stance rather than agency under conflict; she witnesses transformation but never confronts a contradiction that forces her to alter tactics or foreclose a path. The origami swan discovery and her return to the refuge are contemplative moves, not choices with visible tradeoffs. Backstory dominates without anchoring to present micro-decisions that change her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and character-specific (the locket, her music-therapy lens on "ordinary magic"), and her micro-choices under pressure—removing the locket, reframing Maya's fear—advance the emotional arc. However, the final epiphany about wonder feels stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses; Elena's therapeutic poise never visibly costs her anything on the page, and the moment Maya "understood" is told, not shown through dramatized struggle. The reflective blocks are anchored but tilt toward exposition rather than live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is established early and her perceptual gift drives the discovery sequence. However, her choices feel more observational than decisive—she follows the silo's memory, finds the tapestry, and understands her purpose without significant internal conflict or competing impulses. The final "understood her purpose with sudden clarity" moment reads as epiphany rather than earned contradiction. Embodiment is thin; we see her trailing fingers and pressing palms but little visceral interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei Lin's interiority is concrete and specific—the shift from Cold War operative to fortune writer is traced through micro-choices (wearing the specs, preparing the box, writing the journalist's fortune). Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous desire for revelation and continued orchestration. The backstory, while substantial (~25%), anchors in present stimuli (the specs, tonight's batch, tomorrow's journalist) and tilts present stance through the box-preparation choice. However, the final "orchestrate her own revelation" move reads more告知 than embodied cost; the renunciation lacks visible friction or a moment where competing impulses act simultaneously in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his actions consistent—circling Elena, using rhetorical questions to expose her assumptions. However, his interiority remains largely functional rather than embodied; we see his strategy but rarely feel contradictory impulses. Elena's moment of breakthrough ("I thought if I believed hard enough...") carries genuine vulnerability, but the possession entity is more obstacle than character. The final renunciation lands with visible cost (the dissolution of shadows), meeting baseline expectations without exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Li Wei's motivation is clearly established through her grandmother's legacy and her dissatisfaction with hollow fortunes, but her internal progression relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to descend after writing her last fortune is earned but lacks visible tension between competing desires. The embodiment is selective—"exhaustion settling into her bones like snow"—but peak moments lean toward summarized epiphany ("finally understood") rather than dramatized internal conflict. The character reads as coherent and purpose-driven, yet the arc tilts more toward realized acceptance than a choice forged under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior life is dense with abstract philosophical musing but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The "realization struck like lightning" epiphany arrives without prior dramatized resistance or micro-choices that forecast the shift. The final acceptance of fragmentation reads as declared insight rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Motivation remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt through body and action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's internal journey from numbness to feeling is consistently motivated, and her embodied emotions (tears, trembling fingers) ground the transformation. The thirty-year teaching backstory establishes credible expertise but borders on exposition. The climactic moment lacks sufficient on-page contradiction or struggle—the transformation reads too smooth, with vibrations simply "unwinding" her defenses rather than forcing a costly choice between competing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's meticulous devotion to storm recording and her "credibly curious" nature are established, but her interiority remains somewhat generic—phrases like "the weight of understanding" and "integrity was not a single grand gesture" trend toward abstraction rather than character-particular embodiment. The final choice to "honor the weight of understanding with stillness" followed by plans to distribute evidence feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible internal conflict or cost. Her emotions are described more than embodied, and the contradiction between her careful observation and her willingness to take on dangerous authorities needed sharper on-page tension to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is established through his method of reading objects and writing poetry, with consistent interiority around accumulation and presence. The woman's arrival introduces a second character but her function remains observational rather than applying pressure. Marcus's choice to share the rope and his reflections on play versus weight show micro-choices, but no on-page contradiction or struggle that would push toward higher bands. The final exchange lacks embodied cost or visible foreclosure of a path.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's acoustic perceptiveness is established early and embodied through her noticing "the absence of what should have been there." The progression from fighting the hush to listening to it, then playing "between" the silences, tracks a clear internal shift with contradictory impulses (frustration versus acceptance). The final choice to return and play publicly is motivated by the unbinding knot in her chest, though the cost—playing imperfect music shaped by loss—could be more viscerally dramatized. Her grandmother's bowl functions as a concrete anchor for humility and survival, grounding interiority in a tactile object.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interior voice is distinctive and consistent—"the irony was professionally thorough" carries her vocational lens effectively. The transformation arc is motivated (three days ago inhaling the petal cracked her numbness), but the final state feels declared rather than dramatically tested: "affectionate detachment" and "caring for her clients while releasing them" arrive as thesis statements without visible friction or cost in action. Embodied emotion is strong in moments ("genuine tears, not the glycerin drops"), yet the chemist's embedded "compassion for her" reads as convenient omniscience—how does molecular structure whisper intent?—and the epiphany slides toward therapeutic self-awareness without messy contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's choices drive the story from curiosity through action to ceremony, with micro-choices about opening the envelope and tracking Rosa's legacy. However, her interior remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure; "cautious exuberance" is stated, not shown through contradictory impulses. Elias is functional but secondary, present mainly as recipient. The grandmother's voice intrudes as a thematic echo ("We rise on the shoulders of those the records forget") without friction or current cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veren's motivation is clear and embodied through her reed-weaving, with her search evolving from personal need to community integration. The encounter with Senna shows genuine emotional layering ("recognizing herself in every trembling line"). However, the resolution feels too smooth—Veren's realization that "her search had never really been for the tag-maker" arrives as assertion rather than earned friction, and the final community grafting lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths. Secondary characters (Kael, Mira, Thom, Pell) remain functional but interchangeable, applying pressure without distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's motivation is clear—paleontologist seeking ancient echoes—and her choice to release them is earned by thirty years of drawing incomplete fossils. The time-borrowing mechanic provides embodied cost (warming pendant, exhaustion, traded tomorrows), though the final seated moment feels more resolved than the renunciation warrants. Interior contradiction is present (belief/disbelief shift, yearning for completion vs. awareness of personal cost) but the peak choice lacks visible struggle; she dissolves the cage without hesitation. Grandmother's voice completing its sentence provides emotional payoff, but Miriam's own change reads more as confirmation than transformation with foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and the glass eyes function well as embodied stakes, but her interior often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("mathematics of emotion," "formulas of sustenance") that reads more poetic than psychologically grounded. The apparition dialogue ("I'm what remains when someone isn't gone and isn't here") feels like articulated theme rather than a character discovering something through embodied struggle. The final acceptance and "green shoot of optimism" arrives quickly after seven years of grief, earning the turn through scene work but landing with muted emotional cost. Theo remains more concept than person, which serves the ambiguous-loss premise but flattens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior life is rendered through concrete sense memories and the physicality of her hidden existence, with embodied detail like "dust coating her thin shoulders" and the tape fragment "clutched against her chest." The character demonstrates contradictory impulses—invisibility as survival versus the pull toward visibility—but the final choice to leave Eleanor's letter feels more thematic than earned by on-page pressure that narrows options. The backstory of eviction and shelters operates within BRR allowances but the present-tense micro-choices (deciding to place the letter, organizing the cache) lack sufficient friction or cost to fully dramatize the shift from dweller to keeper. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-awareness ("she was beginning to understand that visibility was not about being seen") that reads more like thematic summary than character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied—bark patches on forearms, hunger replaced by standing in sunlight—with physical symptoms driving her toward acceptance. The transformation is filtered through her botanist's lens consistently. Internal conflict shows genuine contradictory impulses: fear versus the pull toward metamorphosis, resistance versus the lesson her plants taught ("growth cannot be commanded"). The final choice to surrender is earned through accumulated pressure, though the epiphanic phrasing "becoming what she had always been meant to be" edges toward stock resolution language.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's insomnia and compulsive painting are established early, and her weariness shapes micro-choices (venturing east, following rain). The meeting with Theo and their immediate exchange feels somewhat convenient—two exhausted seekers recognizing each other without friction or doubt. Internal contradiction is present (tiredness vs. dedication) but the final shift from "punishment" to "witness" reads more as declaration than earned transformation through specific struggle. The climactic exchange lacks visible cost; both parties gain what they seek without forfeiting a competing need.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and layered, with embodied contradiction: she finds "strange liberation in uncertainty" after decades of compulsive foresight, and her tears in the cave arise from a specific realization about missed ordinary moments. The micro-choices—descending despite darkness, reaching for the pearl—carry visible cost through her thirty-year blindness finally lifted. Minor slips: the pilgrim's peaceful death and blood-map arrive as convenient catalyst rather than dramatized pressure, and the "unseen forces" remain vague witnesses without forcing a harder trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent—returning to archive work to honor the dead—but her interiority remains largely abstract ("reactive vision," "patterns in fragments") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The widow and father moments show impact on others, not Elena's internal conflict. Her final stance (patient continuance) feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. No relationship crucible on the page to test her in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's interiority is specific and embodied early ("checked her pocket watch for the hundredth time"), but her decision to enter the door lacks sufficient dramatized internal conflict—the seventeen years of mapping and her father's disappearance are told rather than shown pressing against her in the threshold moment. The phantom ticket punch functions well as an object that externalizes her doubt collection, yet the final reunion feels unmotivated: no visible struggle between her need for answers and fear of what she'll find. The father's presence at the desk arrives without Clara processing shock, anger, or betrayal, flattening what should be the story's emotional apex.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's skepticism is stated but her internal contradictions never meaningfully complicate her cooperation—she moves through Aldric's instructions without visible friction between doubt and hope. The sister's memory-loss is declared stakes but Mira's emotional state remains abstract; we get "trembling hope" and tears but no embodied, particular grief that shifts her stance. Aldric's "old grief, transformed by time into gentle purpose" is told backstory without present cost. The micro-choices (accepting tea, beginning to write) don't foreclose options or reveal competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is vivid and embodied ("ancient teeth," the fragment pulsing warm), and her manipulation of the other immortals shows agency under pressure. The final choice to step through feels motivated by established traits. However, the other immortals (Aldric, Thessaly, Korvash) remain largely interchangeable—their reactions to Vera's intrigue lack distinct internal conflict, reading more as ensemble decoration than individual crucibles. The change from boredom to vitality is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's core contradiction—honest child of a con artist seeking to understand fair exchange—drives her choices cleanly. Her interiority stays concrete ("the mathematics of a fair trade that never quite balanced") and her final choice to retrieve the ink pot is earned by the scene's pressure. Mr. Chen's "waiting actively" is less embodied; his shift feels declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The characterization is strong but stops short of 8+ because the secondary character's arc is told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivation is clearly established through her ritual and her grandmother's legacy, and her studious observation demonstrates consistent character logic. The interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection about "textures" and "invented histories" without embodied contradiction or genuine internal conflict—she never wavers, doubts, or struggles against competing impulses in the scene. The paper-making customers (mayor, widow Chen) are told rather than dramatized, weakening the sense of relationship pressure. Minor deduction for the somewhat diagnostic framing of her obsession as "inherited" without showing how it complicates her present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies across tides—collecting erased histories to validate her husband's existence and her own survival. Her interior contradiction between the woman who trusted documents and the one who trusts "texture of memories" is embodied through her method of layering fragments. The final choice to confront the doctor is earned by the overheard conversation that links her false death certificate to a pattern of erasures. Minor weakness: the secondary men in the container scene remain voice-indistinct, but they serve as pressure rather than full characters, so the slip is small.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's interior progression from certainty to vulnerable openness tracks consistently through micro-choices (settling beside the cello, drawing the bow, lifting it again). The embodied emotion at key beats—"bright and broken" laughter, weeping and laughing simultaneously—avoids label-only affect. However, the reflection-heavy middle section (her twenty-year career, her reasons for myth-busting) remains largely expository summary rather than dramatic struggle, and the "I became a myth buster because..." self-diagnosis lands as therapeutic articulation no one has mid-crisis. The final stance crystallization (returning with both recorder and compass) earns the renunciation with visible cost, but the pathway there leans on summary more than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's dual allegiance is embodied through concrete micro-choices (adding graffiti, translating between factions, deciding to approach the Marinero elders). Her interiority shows contradictory pulls—"belonged to everyone and no one"—but the final choice to build more bridges reads as an extension of her established trait rather than a costly renunciation or transformation that forecloses a path. The foundation stone chip is handled twice but remains a static comfort object rather than driving a visible trade-off. Backstory about grandmother and commune history stays brief and anchored to present stakes, meeting BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's characterization is grounded in concrete interiority—her purposeful curiosity about endings, her father's inheritance, her methodical setup. The backstory reflection (father's observatory, the vial) is substantial but anchored to present choices and primes the closure. Internal contradiction is present but muted: she appreciates progress yet mourns its cost, though this tension never forces a harder choice on the page. The final moment feels earned but passive—she descends with the photograph rather than making a renunciation or stance that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her sensory methods, but her competence lacks genuine struggle—every diagnostic choice succeeds without error or false starts. The merchant and his anxiety provide functional pressure but remain a stock figure. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through repair beats with unwavering confidence, and the final smile feels like a tidy emotional bow rather than earned complexity. The "heartfelt artisan" framing verges on label-speak ("believed that everything broken carried within it the memory of wholeness") without dramatized cost to that belief.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is rooted in concrete professional obsession and personal void, with embodied loneliness ("competence had never been enough to make her lovable"). Her internal contradiction—seeking answerable geographic truth to compensate for unanswerable personal loss—drives the journey with visible cost. The micro-choices (checking GPS, instructing Volkov about the green folder) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the backstory about daughter and wife, while anchoring present stance, skirts diagnostic phrasing ("Why competence had never been enough") without full embodiment in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bell tuner's motivation is clear—restore balance to prevent destructive collapse—but her infinite patience functions more as a label than a lived constraint that shapes specific choices under pressure. Interior access remains minimal; we observe her ritualized movements but never feel contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The seventeen souls are largely passive witnesses rather than sources of relational pressure, and the final choice to hand over the tuning fork feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's motivations are clear and embodied: desperation for funding, professional validation, and the pull of discovery. The internal conflict between scientific ambition and instinctual reverence is well-dramatized through her physical hesitation at the altar. Her choice to release rather than exploit the memories earns the final shift, though the dead explorer's motivations could be more distinctly rendered. Minor reliance on summary emotion ("the gathered hush pressed against her") slightly softens peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Milo's motivation is clear and his arc from inherited shame to self-authored witness is coherent. The interiority is specific ("words evaporating from his tongue"), and the final choice to hold proof and await the patrol is earned. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat abstract—the confrontation with the hush-creature lacks embodied fear or contradictory impulses that would show genuine struggle. The father's presence is backstory-heavy but does tilt present stance through the letters and scratches.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation through concrete action (tending the garden, pressing the bead), but his interior life lacks contradictory impulses—he accepts Maren's presence and the ritual with minimal visible struggle or cost to himself. The "mournful elation" at the end is asserted rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. Maren's characterization is stronger, with the "lovingly venomous" duality shown through guidance-plus-tribute, though her agency remains mostly reactive until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Meren's motivation is clear and particularized through her role as weaver, with micro-choices shown in her positioning and stitching. Internal conflict between tradition and compassion is dramatized through her grandmother's voice and the broken precedents. The sleepwalkers remain atmospheric rather than individuated, but this fits the accumulative design. Emotional embodiment is present but sometimes slides toward label-work ("her motivation burned clear").

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's journey from skeptic to believer is signaled clearly, but the transformation lacks sufficient internal contradiction or struggle—she shifts from "find proof that the old stories were lies" to restoration with minimal embodied resistance. The moment of understanding at the sundial ("understood with sudden clarity") reads as epiphany rather than earned conflict. Micro-choices during wandering (gathering materials, stripping branches) show purposeful action, but the cost of completing her family's interrupted journey remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her internal world is well-rendered through her "carefully inventive mind" and ritual practices. However, the piece remains largely observational—she decodes, composes, and deposits a letter without facing contradiction or internal conflict that forces a consequential choice under pressure. The final micro-choice (smiling at the child) doesn't foreclose a path or alter stakes. Her competence is untroubled, and no genuine struggle tests her commitment to this work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's "fool's smile" gambit is motivated and embodied through concrete micro-choices (spilling spools, adjusting her voice). Her interiority balances competence with genuine tension—she collects intelligence while managing the precarity of her position. The final choice to carry evidence through servants' passages is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the eternal flame's role as memory device edges toward symbolic convenience without constraining a single on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste's interior life is specific and embodied—the unconscious gesture with the shard, the fierce push-pull between blame and love. Her motivation is richly contradictory: afraid that forgiving her mother meant "the fire didn't matter." The final choice to speak after twenty years feels earned by the sustained pressure of her silence. Minor deduction: the mother's off-page presence limits relational crucible work, and some therapeutic framing ("loving someone whose flaws had shaped you") edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's translator background and guilt over the boy's death anchor her interiority well, and her micro-choices—decrypting the cast, softening the boat message—constrain options with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the coral fragment paradox (kept as reminder, meaning unclear to her) and in her fear of "remembering things wrong" while actively altering a translation. The renunciation at the end (throwing the coral into the harbor) feels earned by the scene's work. Minor slip: the girl's "shrewdly innocent" trait remains more told than shown in Marina's perception rather than demonstrated through the child's contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clearly established and her interior state is grounded in concrete contradictions—corporate work that "hollowed her spirit" versus the ache she feels before the fragment. The recovery of joy is dramatized through her work on the wall and culminates in a genuine laugh. However, the epiphany arrives through reflection and metaphor rather than through a difficult on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the protagonist observes and creates but does not face a meaningful decision that alters her options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margot's professional identity as a mural restorer anchors her perceptual signature strongly—rubbing the hobo nickel, positioning herself between reflectors. The methodical-to-playful progression shows arc, and the grandfather's folk-art philosophy seeds her final stance. However, the "nested awakenings, she thought, though she couldn't remember learning that phrase" reads as convenient authorial insertion rather than earned insight, and the transformation from restorer to "restored" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's roguish charm is asserted ("charming smile, the one that had talked him out of three expulsions") rather than shown constraining present choices under pressure. His scholar-rogue duality reads competent but safe; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Sofia's shift from confusion to understanding feels too smooth—no visible cost or foreclosed path. The final choice to learn the alphabet carries promise but no on-page friction that would earn a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minerva's interior landscape is richly drawn through embodied action—tracing fingers, singing off-key, cultivating algae—rather than labels. Her "shyly unstoppable" nature manifests in contradictory impulses: ensconcing herself deeper when memories surge yet continuing to sing nightly. The insomnia and grief-driven photosynthesis of pain into beauty are motivated and consistent. Minor slip: the young creature with "too many arms" taught to write a century ago feels like a token gesture toward secondary pressure rather than a live constraint on present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation crystallizes clearly—preserving forgotten names—and her actions are consistent (tending orchids, climbing to the restoration chamber, performing the ritual). However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction; she moves through her task without visible internal friction or competing impulses. The daughter's lost name provides emotional weight, but the choice to restore feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final weeping reads as cathartic release without prior resistance that would make the surrender costly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interior stakes (guilt, cowardice dressed as righteousness) drive the reconciliation choice with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and particular to her profession ("symphonies of truth hidden in ancient syntax"). Elias's "careful recklessness" operates as a label more than embodied contradiction, and his interior access is thin. The final mutual promise forecloses three years of silence with felt cost, though the shift from anger to forgiveness accelerates in the final third without intermediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal life is delivered through credible physical detail (trembling hands, tear-streaked face) and her career as a floodgate machinist anchors her moral calculus in concrete terms. However, the story relies heavily on backstory to establish motivation rather than present-tense choices under pressure—her grandmother's letter and the decoded confession dominate, leaving Mira's own agency largely reactive until the final decision to wait. The closing resolve ("dappled resolve... willingness to hold contradiction") edges toward abstraction rather than embodied consequence, and the cost of her silence remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is richly textured with embodied detail (the meteorite making her weep, swallowing the old lie). The decision to tell Mira the truth constitutes a meaningful choice with visible cost—abandoning the protective silence that defined three years. However, the pigeons and scandal backstory arrives largely as exposition rather than embodied memory pressing on present action, and the final journal moment edges toward therapeutic self-awareness ("Trust, she wrote, is learning...") that slightly flattens character-particular voice. The micro-choice to share the meteorite and the confession scene carry genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Wren's interior world is richly textured through sensory intuition (reading wood grain "like braille"), and her seventeen-year exile establishes clear motivation. The emotional progression feels somewhat abstract—"featherly determined" is poetic but doesn't fully embody contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to step through the threshold is prepared by accumulative reflection, but the moment when her father begins searching feels convenient rather than earned by Wren's agency, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's isolation and pilgrimage toward belonging are clearly motivated, and her micro-choices (kneeling, sharing the feather) feel earned. However, her interiority leans toward abstract poetic description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The relationship with Theo develops cleanly but remains largely harmonious without the friction or competing impulses that would demonstrate true internal conflict acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's emotional specificity is strong—"cheerful gloom" is embodied through contradictory impulses (tears and laughter coexist naturally). The transliteration process is enacted concretely in two beats (crater glass alone, then layered with seeds), showing work rather than declaring insight. Internal contradiction operates in scene: she seeks answers yet the resolution is accepting not-finding. Minor cap: the sister's arc is entirely reflective backstory without on-page friction, and the final peace arrives without visible cost to Mira's present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is signaled early and her calculating approach is consistently embodied through chess-piece positioning and acoustic mapping. Internal contradiction appears weakly: she believes she's "not a manipulator" yet engineers every moment, but this tension never forces a difficult choice on the page. The child's splash offers a moment of genuine adaptation, yet Marina smoothly incorporates it without visible cost or friction that would test her control philosophy. The ending renunciation—walking away satisfied—feels too comfortable given the premise of needing space for the unplanned.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Selene's interiority is vivid and her motivation clear, but Kira's arc feels rushed—her transformation from hollow to anchored lacks intermediate micro-choices that would show internal contradiction under pressure. The phrase "particular starvation of someone forbidden from her own purpose" reads slightly diagnostic. Selene's choices drive the ceremony, but Kira's hesitance-to-commitment happens in a single beat without visible struggle, reducing the earned quality of her final smile.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and consistent—her observation through physics and light feels character-specific. The decision to rebuild scattered pieces rather than fight demolition shows internal logic under pressure. Minor slip: the "conversation with the bay" and grandmother's superstition feel somewhat ornamental rather than driving contradiction. The final choice carries visible cost (abandoning the atrium, embracing impermanence) and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent—grief, the need to honor his daughter, and the struggle to let go. His embodied emotion is strong throughout (burn scars catching moonlight, skilled footwork, paralysis at release). Internal conflict operates via his realization that releasing ashes is both necessary and a final admission of loss. The shift at the end feels earned by the accumulation of memory and present-moment pressure, though the epiphany about pain being universal arrives somewhat cleanly without the messier contradictions that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's baseline motivation (save her daughter) is clear and her physicist identity colors her approach to the grotto's visions. However, the key "choice" to contact Geneva emerges through passive observation of bead patterns rather than dramatized internal conflict; the discovery feels delivered rather than wrestled from contradictory impulses. The grandmother's voice and the altitude gauge provide texture, but Marina's actual decision-making remains externalized through symbolic arrangement rather than embodied struggle. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("logical dreamer," "serene upheaval") without the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clearly rooted and drives her choices through the discovery sequence. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between scientific cartographer and mystical dreamer, embodied in her choice to set aside sensors for diaries. However, the character arc resolves through realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she will "continue the cartography" without demonstrable alteration or renunciation. The grandmother's influence and Helena's mirror-work provide depth, but Mira's final stance feels like confirmation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; her work unfolds smoothly without internal friction or meaningful choice under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied emotion—"perceptive calm" remains a label without dramatized cost. The borrowed-heartbeat mechanism is told rather than felt, and the protagonist's solitary action gives no relationship crucible to test motive. The ending renunciation (leaving unsigned) carries no visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her operational gentleness shows through gesture ("fingers operatively gentle"), but the forty-three-year backstory compresses motivation into summary rather than live contradiction. Her choices at the terrace—handing pens, timing the alignment—feel more procedural than driven by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final clipboard moment gestures toward endurance but doesn't dramatize a visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply continues. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than embodied in competing wants colliding on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's interior voice is distinct and her motivations are rooted in consistent contradictory impulses—building hospitals with poisoned-aquifer money, creating drought to prevent worse poisoning. The choice to leave the egg and speaker is motivated by her stated "sentimental weakness," though her interiority occasionally leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("killed that weakness...or thought she had"). The final act of kneeling in dissolving salt and walking away without looking back embodies her renunciation with visible cost, forecloses sentimentality as redemption, and reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Meridia's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("her boundaries were not weakness but architecture") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to defy conformity is established but her chastity reads more as authorial premise than lived tension—no on-page moment shows her wrestling with desire versus principle. The voices she inherits arrive as declarative wisdom ("you are made of the same fire that lights the stars") without friction or cost that alters her present stance. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation is well-grounded in his shift from commercial calligraphy to subversive puppet shows, and his choices under pressure (performing the puppet show for Vera) reveal character through action. Vera's transformation from anger to tears shows embodied emotion, and the "uncommonly serene" trait constrains her opening stance. The final gesture—both adding marks in the dust—earns a small shift with visible cost (mutual vulnerability). Minor deduction: the internal conflict could be more contradictory in real time rather than sequenced neatly through dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical actions (knotting rope, building structures) rather than stated. The grandmother's backstory operates functionally, grounding Vera's mission in inherited loss and dismissed expertise. Internal contradiction appears when she weeps knowing she "had not saved them"—the tension between witness and futility is sustained without resolution. The final choice to dismantle the structures and continue her work demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elin's internal journey from guilt through forgiveness to action is consistently embodied through her tactile work with wax, rope, and memory. The contradictory impulses—desperate grip versus letting go—operate simultaneously in the sanctum scene, not as sequential summary. Minor slip: the brother and mother's names surface through the rope's structure rather than earned internal struggle, slightly externalizing what should be visceral reclamation. The final renunciation of bronze-casting permanence for embodied song carries visible cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation is clear and her gift creates an interesting constraint, but her interior life relies heavily on conceptual abstraction ("phantom timelines," "paths were alive") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "walk with them" rather than "master the paths" arrives through reflection rather than a dramatized collision of wants. The renunciation has conceptual weight but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a specific path on the page—she gains "entirely new" future rather than losing something particular.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is distinct and her frugality shapes her methodology, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The "empirically ironic" trait is labeled but never constrains a tactical decision. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through the night's work without competing impulses or genuine friction between rationalist skepticism and mystical seeking. The final packing of the tile reads as inevitable victory rather than a choice forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mireva's scheming pacifist role is conveyed through exposition rather than demonstrated through on-page choices under pressure. Thorne's arc—from clenched fists to unclenched—traces a clear change, but the cellular memory mechanism does most of the work; his internal contradiction is told ("resentment like a second skeleton") rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene. The moment of release feels unmotivated by his own struggle; Mireva's touch and the music box do the heavy lifting, reducing his agency. Embodied emotion is present in tears and trembling, but the epiphany arrives via mystical transmission rather than earned internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's seventeen-year search is embodied through her craft and shows clear internal contradiction: she wants to capture the dream yet realizes at closure it has been calling her forward. The final choice to break synchronization and return is earned, foreclosing immediate union with visible cost. Interiority remains concrete and craft-specific throughout. Minor deduction: the astronomer remains a convenient shadow figure whose backstory serves setup without complicating present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's characterization shows clear interior texture—the whirring quartz eye, the fog-colored ribbon, the embodied grief for her daughter—and her agency drives the climb and the teaching decision. Petra's "endearingly feisty" trait manifests in sharp dialogue and action (already perched higher, insisting they bring everything), creating a credible secondary pressure. The final choice to pass the ribbon and commit to teaching feels earned by prior causality, though the emotional progression from months of assumed loss to laughter could use one more visible friction. Minor: the grandmother-granddaughter dynamic occasionally tilts toward stock banter without deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's interiority is often abstract and declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The piece tells us she is "bewildered" repeatedly but her micro-choices feel more like guided tour stops than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother remains a narrative convenience rather than a lived relationship with friction. The bathroom breakthrough and the carving decision lack visible struggle or foreclosed paths with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shown through gap-research methodology, but her interior life remains thin—we get linguistic expertise labels without embodied contradiction under pressure. The time traveler's seventeen-version exposition dumps character knowledge rather than letting Mira discover it through friction. Her final insight ("The mountain doesn't trap people") arrives as epiphany without prior misbelief dramatized in choice. The botanical diary mechanics and Thessaly's rescue feel more plot-functional than emotionally inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority carries specificity ("loneliness felt as familiar as her own skin"), but her sister exists primarily as a metaphor rather than a character with contradictory impulses. The final choice to "tell our story" feels asserted rather than earned through prior on-page struggle between competing wants. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("cracked something open inside her") but peaks rely on abstraction ("raw material of longing"). The reconciliation unfolds without visible friction or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's methodical trait is demonstrated through her work with the rope and consistent archival approach, but internal contradiction is minimal—she accepts impossibilities with remarkable equanimity. The motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" remains abstract; we never see her struggle with doubt or fear that would make the choice to untangle the rope costly. The characterization is competent and consistent, but the protagonist's adaptability becomes a superpower that flattens genuine struggle. Minor deduction for therapy-speak framing ("adaptable," "warmly, methodically") that labels rather than dramatizes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera's characterization is strong: her ripple-marks serve as both physical history and embodied knowledge now made obsolete, creating genuine internal conflict. Her micro-choices (examining ice patterns, whispering into the stone, deciding to map for others) reveal a hierarchy of values—preservation of silence over personal escape. The final stance is earned through accumulated pressure rather than epiphany, and her decision to map the refuge forecloses solitary retreat with visible cost. Minor slip: the beings' indifference is asserted rather than dramatized through failed communication attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is present but often operates through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivot from "torment" to "thistle-blown hope" occurs cleanly but lacks the messy simultaneity of genuine internal conflict—she abandons her avoidance strategy with little on-page friction. Embodiment is adequate ("frequency in her teeth") yet relies on stock bodily cues ("heart pounding," "trembling") at key turns. The final choice to rekindle the beacon feels predetermined rather than earned through genuine struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is vivid and emotionally contradictory—"preemptively nostalgic for this moment even as she lived it" anchors her in concrete stakes. Her decision to "conjecture forward" and reveal fragmented memory shifts her profession's ethos, earning the change. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized in relationship or capability; we lack a second character to test her stance under interpersonal pressure, and the micro-choice at the shadow dial feels more illustrative than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grief and motivation are established clearly, though her interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's return feels unmotivated—"cruel and necessary" is asserted rather than earned through prior causality. The final choice to continue walking lacks visible cost; it reads as continuation rather than foreclosure of a path. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally lapses into label-speak ("gnawing anxiety").

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through the jade cicada and her handling of it, with clear contradictory impulses (studying transitions versus living them). The confession "I had confused studying transitions with living through them" feels earned by prior material. Elena's micro-choices (touching the cicada, softening her voice, offering to learn) create a credible arc. Minor deduction: some therapy-adjacent phrasing ("warmly observant of her own memory") appears but does not dominate peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's motivation to collect silences is established early and her internal struggle between freedom and fear is embodied through the porcelain doll ritual. The bunker backstory anchors present choices effectively, though the father remains abstract. The final choice to stay and grow "in whatever direction felt like freedom" reads as earned endurance with visible psychological cost, though the decision could push harder against a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eris demonstrates consistent interiority through her acoustic expertise and grief, with embodied emotion in the storm-glass dissolution and final hum. The seventeen-year backstory and Mira's death are efficiently woven into present action without stalling momentum. Internal contradiction surfaces when she seeks "something more difficult" than revenge, driving the choice to release the vial. Minor slip: the final shift to comfort feels slightly under-motivated given the sparse on-page struggle between impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Meridia's motivation is clear and consistent—preserve lore, claim legitimacy—but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The choice to climb is framed as duty without meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses another path. Micro-choices (peeling paint, moving through the orchard) advance plot but don't reveal a hierarchy of competing values. The final ascent reads as inevitable rather than earned through dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior contradictions are well-embodied: she polishes a doorknocker knowing no one will come, builds thresholds yet teaches Sera—contradictory impulses that act in scene rather than toggle sequentially. The burns-scars metaphor for shared wounds is concretely realized through Sera's bandaged hand and the "linking through scars" mechanism. Minor voice convergence at closure ("We start with emptiness") reads more thematic than distinct, and Sera's motivational arc is compressed but legible. The final choice to let Sera in forecloses isolation with visible cost: the sanctuary's dust patterns disturbed, the threshold rebuilt but thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's pyramid-scheme backstory and transformation arc are clearly signaled, and her final "volunteer" choice emerges from her lived experience with pressure. However, the interiority trends toward therapy-speak ("shame compressed into clarity," "grief made gorgeous") that abstracts rather than embodies emotion at peak moments. The porthole bolt functions as a concrete anchor, but the emotional progression from scam victim to diamond-creator feels more declared than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The backstory occupies substantial space (~25%) yet mostly primes rather than actively reshapes present choices until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Margaret's motivation to understand her grandmother is clear and sustained throughout. Her interior journey from confusion to understanding feels earned, though the emotional progression leans heavily on abstract concepts ("bridge of intuition," "standing waves") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to learn the methodology reads as intellectual commitment rather than visceral stakes with visible cost. Interiority remains consistent to the reflective, meditative register established early.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's interiority shows contradictory impulses—doubt carried "like a second skin," the joy "threaded with terror"—but the final transformation feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The shedding of armor is embodied and concrete, yet the shift from withdrawn knight to "vessel rather than warrior" arrives through declarative insight ("Aldric understood now") rather than a dramatized mistake or costly trade-off. The climactic laugh and dance read as emotional summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's interior contradiction—the tension between her broken heart and her archival devotion—is embodied through her micro-choices (photographing the button, replacing it exactly where Thomas left it). The parallel structure between Thomas's search and Eleanor's daily work earns the final stance: "she would never stop being broken-hearted... But she would also never stop looking." Marcus functions as efficient backstory that primes her lens without requiring on-page presence. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular throughout, with no therapy-speak even under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shows through concrete choices (building the network, triggering the decoy). However, her interior life remains largely abstract—we see capability without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The three-year preparation collapsing to hours should create panic or sacrifice, but she executes flawlessly without visible cost to her composure or values. The final choice to "reappear" and continue feels more like a plot move than a character-driven necessity that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The saxophonist's internal state is rendered through embodied detail (dewdrops on brass, the pull of prophecy in her throat), and the choice to use negative-space melody shows clear motivation. However, the grandmother and mother exist only as told backstory without on-page friction, and the protagonist's thirty-year practice feels abstract rather than shown through micro-choices under present pressure. The decision to end the prophecy arrives without visible cost—no stumble, no temptation to speak the words, no moment where the vested hush technique nearly fails.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Wren's interiority is dense and particular ("seeds were potential, leaves were completion"), and her dedication to sorting and monument-building feels lived-in. However, the transformation itself—moonstone dissolving into skin, sudden ability to read leaves—bypasses internal contradiction or struggle; she moves from longing to fulfillment without cost or renunciation visible on the page. The final return to sorting feels like thematic satisfaction rather than a character-driven choice that forecloses a meaningful alternative. Embodied emotion is strong in the middle ("mossy delight"), but the peak beat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior world is textured with embodied contradiction—she understands clocks lie yet spends thirty years fixing them—but her pivotal shifts occur largely in reflective summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (befriending uncertainty) is narrated more than enacted; we're told her motivation crystallized during descent but don't witness the struggle that earns it. Interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("befriend uncertainty in planning") and the admiral functions as philosophical echo rather than immediate pressure. The ending forecloses her old convictions with conceptual cost, but the embodied price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior world is textured and her motivation tracks through specific choices (rekindling the furnace, embedding the coin). Internal conflict between her father's elimination-of-flaws approach and her kintsugi philosophy drives the work. However, the transformation happens in isolation without another character to test her stance, and the epiphany about "honoring impurities" arrives fully formed rather than through dramatized struggle. The philosophical vocabulary ("factually mystical," "balanced alchemist") edges toward label-speak without sufficient embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistent and embodied through concrete details (worn satchel, silent bell, crocodile's tooth). Her arc from existential opacity to purpose-restored healer is earned through the harp encounter, and the spirits' confessions dramatize her unconscious gift. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fearlessness and apprehension, and her final choice to continue is foreclosed by visible cost (the ache that "glowed"). Minor issue: the epiphany moment leans slightly expository ("She had been healing them… offering levity as a bridge") rather than fully dramatized, though the spirits' testimony provides concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is vividly embodied throughout ("seismograph of suffering," "terrifying clarity" of spinal curve), and her motivation to decode the colony's cruelty drives her scene choices. Her actuary background and the physical memory of torture inform her present perception. However, her arc from victim to decoder feels more declared than dramatically earned; the final choice to rewrite mercy is stated as intention rather than tested on the page with visible cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to continue her grandmother's work is established but not tested under meaningful pressure. The choice to take the fragment is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she "hesitates" for one sentence before proceeding. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("that strange country of becoming," "weight and weightlessness of choosing") rather than character-particular embodiment. The decision at closure feels preordained rather than earned through visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her observation of dust patterns, her comfort with ghosts since childhood—but her choices are largely dictated by the ghost rather than internal conflict. The grandmother anecdote and career backstory provide texture, but the protagonist follows rather than struggles; her decision to take the mainspring feels inevitable without visible cost or competing impulse. Embodied emotion is present ("that familiar pull in her chest") but the lack of contradictory wants in the key moment limits characterization depth.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's internal contradiction—maintaining a perfect press while longing to disrupt perfection—is present but told more than shown in micro-choices. The final decision to pull the lever feels somewhat announced rather than earned through a sequence of smaller resistances. Interiority leans abstract ("vibrational key," "negotiable reality") rather than embodied; the piece would benefit from more concrete sensory contradiction under pressure. The change is present but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's revolutionary past and current archaeological obsession are established, but her internal contradiction feels stated rather than dramatized in scene. The mirror-uncovering choice is motivated, yet the transition from cataloging to joining the civilization happens too quickly—the embodied struggle between academic distance and revolutionary fire needed more pressure. Her poetic nature is told through verse fragments but doesn't constrain choices until the final act. The crystal shard functions mechanically as a key rather than revealing character through contradictory handling.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interior is vivid and character-specific through his forty years of listening to "confessions" of automata. The wilting sensation when he recognizes his dishonest hope for resurrection is well-embodied and drives a meaningful pivot. The moment "I understand now. You're not here to resurrect the past" earns the shift through prior interiority. Minor slip: the grandmother's impossible note could use one more grounding beat to anchor motivation earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—her embodied connection to the compass, her professional practice grounded in specific sensory work. Internal contradiction appears when she seeks rational boundaries yet surrenders to mystery, though this could deepen. The vision of Vennard functions as reflection but anchors in the compass-touch and tilts her present stance toward acceptance. Minor slip: "hinged awakenings" reads slightly diagnostic in a peak moment, though it's framed as Vennard's term rather than naked therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's decision to hold the slide to lightning demonstrates agency, but her internal process lacks contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from dismissal to understanding without visible friction. The grandmother's "timewoven alliances" functions as received knowledge rather than a choice-forcing belief system Marina must wrestle with on the page. Embodied emotion is thin: "racing thoughts" steadied by sound is told rather than shown through perception or micro-choice. The final renunciation (abandoning GPS navigation for resonance-reading) arrives without visible cost—no foreclosed path, no trade-off dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is strongly established through her obsessive study of the glass layers and grandmother's postcards, with embodied decisions (arriving before dawn, choosing palette). The motivation to understand night-blooming flowers drives her actions coherently. However, the grandmother exists entirely in backstory without on-page pressure, and Mira's epiphany about darkness offering intimacy arrives through reflection rather than a choice under duress. The final act of painting additions each autumn shows endurance but the cost remains abstract—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's motivation is clear and intensifies appropriately, though her interior work relies heavily on label-heavy terms ("retrocognitively trapped," "searing reverie") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to record testimony feels inevitable given her archival role, but the moment lacks visible cost—she carries "weight" but we don't see what she sacrifices or forecloses. The grandmother figure arrives late and her backstory is told rather than tested under pressure, reducing relational crucible work.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and sustained—rejection of the Academy's reductionism drives her journey—but her internal process feels over-articulated and diagnostic ("murder of meaning," the fisherman's wish parsed into meta-commentary). The final choice to create crystallized-memory lanterns arrives smoothly, yet her renunciation of the Academy seventeen years prior lacks on-page friction or visible cost in the present window. Embodied emotion is thin; most interiority operates at the level of philosophical summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation to archive emotional patterns is established, but her interiority remains abstract—"venerable oath scribe" functions more as archetype than embodied character. The third-grade memory provides backstory anchor, yet the present-tense choices (kneeling, speaking, writing) read as ritual performance rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final realization "she had been building a map" arrives as epiphany without prior contradiction or struggle visible on the page. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are present but muted by the prevalence of summary and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistent and voice-specific ("furious tranquility," worn acorn cap), but her motivation remains largely abstract. The pivotal choice—to access the vortex—unfolds without meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The understanding she gains ("texture of patience") reads as received insight rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present but muted; the stakes feel declared more than dramatized in her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's seventeen-year siren-testing history and her choice to embrace listening over noise are grounded in concrete professional experience. Her "credibly curious" observation of microclimate patterns and the final bell-pull show consistent traits driving the closure choice. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous humility and expertise, embodied in her patient instrument-checking versus the weight of calibrating terror. The keeper community's recognition and the final choice feel earned, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract meditation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is embodied and distinctive ("her joints protesting with familiar ache"), and her choice to stay exhibits commitment with cost. However, the internal contradiction feels declared rather than dramatized—the armor-to-smallness arc is told in summary without on-page micro-choices showing contradictory impulses in action. The spiritual curiosity that drives her presence reads more as static trait than evolving pressure, and the final renunciation (never leaving) lacks a present competing pull to foreclose with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and perceptive ("reading the gestures of the departed as others once read books"), with embodied emotion in key moments. However, her choices feel observational rather than genuinely conflicted—she accepts each ghost without internal resistance or cost that tests her commitment. The grandmother's motivational backstory anchors the covenant effectively, but Maren's three-year practice lacks visible strain or a hierarchy of competing values at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and consistently rendered through concrete action (handling the fragment, reconstructing listings). Her borrowed-years backstory is purpose-driven, anchoring her work without stalling momentum. However, her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—she never struggles against her chosen path or faces a meaningful trade-off between competing desires. The final stance ("no longer felt borrowed") is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's choices are coherent and motivated by her established philosophy of finding beauty in brokenness. Her decision to give the feather to the kite is grounded in prior reflection (grandmother's teaching) and her immediate perception of the damaged feather. The boy's arc is functional but remains surface-level; his shift from dismay to curiosity is shown but not complicated by internal contradiction. Emotional embodiment is adequate—"eyes red-rimmed but not quite crying"—though some passages drift toward summary ("his disappointment slowly shifting") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's "brazen calm" operates consistently across beats, and her systematic approach to the orchard work feels earned by forty years of caretaking. The interior access is concrete—particularly in moments like pressing copper wire and reading the orchard's signals—though the emotional progression toward death remains somewhat abstract; we see her hands tremble and her teaching the islanders, but the cost of dying feels more asserted than embodied. The final choice to "wait for the conversation to include her" reads as passive acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior voice shows academic skepticism through specific professional history ("written papers about manufactured meaning"), and her final shift from skepticism to luminous certainty is signaled. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves from one pole to another without dramatized internal friction. The elderly man's tears and the other five pilgrims remain functionally interchangeable, applying no relational pressure. The "chemistry of homecoming" reflection anchors in the amber but the epiphany arrives through extended meditation rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Erasmus is rendered through concrete particulars—his patient observation of cormorants, the leather pouch ritual, the nightly walks—that give him texture and motive. The internal contradiction between his solitary fluency in dead languages and his commitment to a decades-long garden project creates authentic tension. Micro-choices (selecting vetch pods, crushing them at the prescribed hour) reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance—continuing until "the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses retreat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta's motivation is clear and embodied—her shift from body-finder to daughter-seeker is concretely grounded in the waxed leaf memory. The final choice to walk east is earned by prior causality with visible cost (abandoning her settlement perch, gathering courage). Interior voice remains consistent and particular throughout. Minor: the daughter's fascination with transformation is told rather than shown in early beats, slightly weakening the memory's anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is established through her solitary documentation practice, and her choice to finish the sketch before engaging with the approaching ship shows agency under pressure. However, the transformation from "raged against the glass" to purposeful documentarian is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the earned quality of her final stance. The mutation that grants temporal immunity reads as convenient biology rather than a trait that complicates choice. Embodied emotion is present but occasional therapy-speak ("blessed and cursed," "true north of her own strange existence") softens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corwin's motivation is clear and rooted in apprenticeship to wonder, but his internal experience remains fairly smooth—no genuine contradictions act simultaneously in scene. The letter reveal provides emotional payoff, yet the weeping-then-laughing beat reads as performed rather than embodied with specific physical sensation. The final transformation into "keeper of wonders who had never forgotten how to steal" is declared more than earned through on-page friction between old thief habits and new keeper duties.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interior is sharply rendered through embodied contradiction—performing trauma for money while mourning authentic loss, carving pawns by firelight as a benevolent-ruthless gesture. The final choice to walk out spelling "remember" and leave the pawns behind is earned by her winter's work and felt accumulation of grief. Minor slip: the camps backstory is told efficiently but remains slightly expository rather than filtering all present perception through that lens. The micro-choices (placing each pawn, naming them) credibly alter her stance from purgatory-dweller to historian-complete.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interior life is textured and specific—the mercury metaphor embodied through "memories bleeding out each dawn like water through cupped hands" and the night-by-night reconstruction. Her agency escalates from passive discovery to deliberate action ("traced the stone's symbols onto her reflective skin"), and the final climb embodies contradictory impulses: wholeness and pain together. Minor slip: the shift from pain-avoidance to pain-acceptance feels slightly rushed in the final third, though the line "finally whole enough to hurt" earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the chess-piece fidgeting, thread-sorting hands—embodying guilt through action rather than declaration. His arc from self-blame to renunciation ("he had taught chess, not murder") is earned by the physical act of releasing the knight into the labyrinth's center. Internal conflict is present but somewhat abstract; the contradiction between his agency (teaching) and his culpability could have been dramatized more sharply in a micro-choice that tests his hierarchy of values. The final letting-go feels motivated and closes a path, but the emotional progression tilts slightly toward articulated insight rather than messy contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sera's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—artist, rebel, preserver of complexity. Her mother's contradictory nature is told rather than shown in action, relying on summary ("healer who sometimes harmed"). Internal conflict is present but largely reflective; the ritual itself lacks embodied contradiction beyond the opening of her mouth. The final choice feels earned by setup but the renunciation cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is vivid and consistently rooted in workshop action—matching statue pockmarks to memory wounds creates embodied pressure. The key daughter revelation at the climax feels earned by the escalating pattern of matched losses. Minor deduction: some introspection ("uncertain alchemist, always had been") edges toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction in scene. The final choice to write transforms uncertainty into stance with visible cost (the shattered charm), meeting the agency bar.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Edwin's interior life is specific and embodied—the faded sunset that "hurt," grief threatening to "swallow him whole," painting with "intimately aloof" distance. The motivation to keep creating as a promise to his daughter is concrete and drives the climactic revelation when he sees her face in the water. However, the daughter exists only in backstory; no secondary character applies live pressure. The final choice to return home feels somewhat predetermined rather than forged under contradictory impulses in the cave scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—pressing palm to stone, carrying the cork, making tea—and her stance is rooted in her grandmother's teaching about quiet attention. The boy's grief is particularized through the funeral detail and the scent mechanism, though his manifestation as "flickering at the edges" risks abstraction. Internal contradiction appears when Mira feels "screaming tenderness" and uses the cork to filter emotions, showing layered response. The final choice to guide him through lighthouse work earns the closure, though the boy's agency remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation (navigating loss through literal and metaphorical means) drives consistent choices under pressure. The emotional progression through grief to purposeful action feels earned, with embodied moments like gripping the bronze censer foot. However, the revelation that the caller is her future self arrives without sufficient groundwork, creating a slight motivation gap at the closure beat that weakens what is otherwise strong character work.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("mathematics of survival," soil pH/spore patterns grounding her rationality). Her internal contradiction—craving isolation yet recognizing the need for connection—drives the choice to replicate the cure. The weeping moment when she lies successfully is embodied and earned. Minor slip: the sister's truth-telling that "could never be unheard" is told rather than shown, and the final decision to spread the cure arrives quickly without visible on-page friction between safety and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is fully realized through specific interiority—"learning to read the language of silences," naming storms, archiving phantom experiences—with embodied contradiction between isolation and connection. His micro-choices (writing in the logbook, deciding to find the woman) emerge organically from established traits. The borrowed-memories conceit risks abstraction but stays grounded through concrete sensory flashes ("A woman's voice," "weight of a child's hand"). Minor slip: the final paragraph's emotional pivot ("did not feel entirely solitary") verges on summary rather than showing the shift through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is established through thirty years of cataloging and her father's deathbed promise, embodied in her "empirically intuitive sense." The decision at the doorway—whether to step through or return—presents genuine internal conflict. However, the final choice remains ambiguous on the page; we see only the abandoned shop weeks later, making the core renunciation or acceptance feel summarized rather than dramatically embodied. The father's appearance at the threshold reads somewhat convenienient, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The queen's contradictory impulses—wanting truth while fearing it, needing the advisor who poisoned her husband—act simultaneously in scene through embodied choices (the climb itself, settling across from the oracle despite exhaustion). The recovered memory beat earns the final stance with visible cost: seven years of complicity. Minor slip: "softly commanding" appears twice as a label without full dramatization of the trait's tradeoff under pressure, though her deliberate movements down the mountain partly compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is vivid and specific—her hands still when Theo names her mother, the pocket-sun flares with her emotional chemistry—but the final shift from "trap" to "participate" arrives through summary reflection rather than a hard embodied choice under pressure. Theo functions more as philosophical guide than pressure source; his seven years of observation and the shell-as-answer insight feel generous rather than conflicted. The protagonist's core contradiction (measuring love to prove moments matter vs. needing to live them) is present but resolved via dialogue epiphany instead of a costly action that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera's interior life is richly rendered through concrete details—tracing the scroll, reading entries—and her jealousy of past selves creates genuine internal contradiction. The transition from "chronicler's curse" to accepting chaos as narrative shows earned development. However, the final turn toward "ready to stop fearing and start writing toward" her grave feels slightly under-motivated given the intensity of temporal confusion established earlier. Embodied emotion is strong ("something sharp twist beneath her ribs") but the resolution could bear more visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied—her compensatory shift to touch after losing smell, the patient listening posture. Margaret's grief is handled well through "storms" in her eyes and defensive finger-curl, though her arc feels more symbolic than psychologically contradictory. The final exchange about "ordinary miracles" skirts therapy-speak but stays anchored in concrete work. No profound internal conflict dramatized in the closure beat; Elena's stance is stable rather than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied—frost crystallizing along fingertips, the lightning scar's geography, counting heartbeats instead of crows. Internal conflict operates in scene: she holds her breath to manage fear while simultaneously tracing runes onto the forming ice, contradictory impulses acting together. The final choice to accept the ice as language rather than flaw is earned by the prior ritual sequence and grandmother's teaching. Minor slip: the epiphany "the ice was not a flaw to be purged but a language to be spoken" edges toward label-speak, though it's immediately grounded in the commitment to write scars into stories.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (the perfume bottle, the electromagnetic apparatus), and Eleanor's manifestation shows concrete supernatural constraint. However, the central choice—to perform this exorcism—feels pre-determined rather than tested under pressure; Marcus arrives already committed, executes the plan without meaningful internal friction, and succeeds without visible cost to himself. The apology is delivered, but no path is foreclosed for the protagonist. Eleanor's emotional arc is more complete than Marcus's.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists as a pure philosophical vessel without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract ("she understood now that unraveling was not destruction but translation") without concrete sensory grounding or competing impulses. The "witness" role is told rather than dramatized through specific dilemmas that force trade-offs. No visible cost accompanies her transformation; she simply becomes "the resolution" through assertion rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Einar's interiority is concrete and particular ("hydraulic clock shepherd" duties grounded in tactile detail). The seventeen-year trajectory from dismissal to understanding shows internal evolution, and the final choice to step through carries visible cost (leaving his known world). Minor weakness: the transition from skepticism to belief could show more internal contradiction in the counting sequence itself, where contradictory impulses might act simultaneously rather than sequentially.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margot's interiority is distinct and filtered through her mathematical lens, with embodied contradictions (carrying the broken lantern, studying father's irrational gambling). The character work is competent but the motivation for continuing the subway project feels asserted rather than earned through pressure—she decides to pay debts and continue research without on-page friction testing those choices. The father exists only in reflection; no secondary character applies live pressure. Internal conflict is present but remains contemplative rather than forcing immediate tradeoffs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and consistent—she positions herself as a waystation for grief, teaching callers to redirect their circular mourning. Her embodied response to Danny's mother (the glass disc handling, thumb along the edge) grounds emotion physically. The seven-call detail demonstrates patience and tracking, and her final choice to redirect the woman toward baby pictures shows agency with visible cost (she releases the loop rather than holding it). Minor slip: the woman's forgetting previous calls feels convenient rather than causally grounded in grief's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marguerite's motivations are clear and her arc from unknowing archivist to covenant-renewer is legible. However, the pivotal choice—offering the locket—lacks internal resistance or cost; she moves from discovery to acceptance with euphoric ease rather than contradictory impulses. The Keeper functions as exposition delivery rather than a pressure source, and the grandmother backstory anchors motivation but does not create on-page friction. Embodied emotion appears in "tears on her cheeks, but they came with laughter" yet the moment feels performed rather than wrestled-with.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's characterization shows consistent elusiveness and career-long avoidance patterns, with her final offer to stay driven by recognizing herself in the network she's been running from. The "desperately jocular" trait appears in the fox exchange but reads more as a label than embodied contradiction under pressure. Okonkwo's instantaneous catalogue of Maya and his gardener-philosopher persona feel convenient rather than earned through prior beats. The ending choice arrives without visible internal conflict—Maya offers to help distribute the compound without dramatized resistance to her fifteen-year pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Meridia's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her absorption of ultrasonic frequencies, her grandmother's ring humming against her skin. The stillpoint discovery drives a meaningful choice: she touches emotional neutrality and consciously rejects it, choosing to "keep feeling." Internal contradiction appears when she discovers the stillpoint isn't destination but doorway, and her renunciation is embodied through the map she creates for another while refusing return for herself. Minor deduction for the "quiet blaze" phrase appearing twice as a somewhat abstract summary rather than fully embodied sensation in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her interior life is sufficiently concrete, particularly in her relationship with her mentor's teachings. The emotional stakes of having destroyed a civilization anchor her choices. However, the final decision to send the corrected message feels somewhat easy—the anomaly conveniently provides a revision opportunity without forcing her to face a meaningful tradeoff or foreclosure. The piece needed Vera to sacrifice something tangible or accept an irreversible cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is vivid and specific—translating silence into music through felt vibrations is embodied rather than declared. Elena's exhaustion and the weight of "unspoken counsel" create character-particular tension. The overnight teaching session compresses what should be a gradual shift; Elena's transformation from advisor to silence-mapper feels under-dramatized, relying on summary ("Through the night, they worked together") rather than showing micro-choices that alter her stance. The final choice—Elena walking toward the council with "silence like a torch"—lands with metaphorical weight but minimal visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's motivation is coherent—rescuing her father's promise—and her past actions (library arson, seventeen-year search) establish stakes. However, the central discovery unfolds passively: she observes paintings and reads a letter rather than making choices under pressure. The "analytically intuitive" trait is declared but never constrains a visible action or creates a tradeoff. Interior voice leans toward label-speak ("grief so tender it could have melted stone") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (breaking rules, climbing, drumming) are embodied. However, the piece relies heavily on reflection about Elias rather than showing Mira's internal contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice feels like completion of a plan rather than a decision under conflicting pressures. Her renunciation of Elias's presence is stated ("felt him leaving") but the cost reads more as relief than genuine loss with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Celia's maintenance expertise and sensory skills are well-established through concrete detail ("every rust spot, every groan"). Her decision to follow the stranger and eventually guide him shows agency under pressure. The man's motivation (finding his father's hidden legacy) lands with embodied emotion ("eyes wet"), though his backstory arrives via summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Minor: Celia's interior voice remains consistent but her final choice to help feels slightly under-motivated given the stated risks.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's silence, her use of the dental mirror, and her shutter-weaving are grounded in backstory and consistently embodied through selective perception. Her motivation to prevent another drowning is earned, and the final choice—remaining at her post after the boy leaves—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (ongoing vigil, unresolved grief). The boy's interiority is limited to observation, reducing the interplay that would elevate this to high 8s. Minor deduction for the phrase "spiralingly calm" appearing twice as a label without dramatized contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's gift of hearing unspoken words is established early and her chess-teaching motivation is clear, but her interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The decision to organize the window displays feels like a fait accompli rather than a choice under pressure—she's already committed at story open. Embodied emotion is sparse; we're told she carries "weight of words no one had spoken aloud" but the physical experience of her ability never complicates a choice on the page. Marcus functions as memory-motivator but doesn't apply immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's transformation and decision to dive are motivated by coherent desire, and Jonas's guarded-to-raw arc via the scrimshaw is purposeful. However, the Treaty backstory (violence becomes impossible) feels like convenient world-building that doesn't constrain Mira's central choice—she was already hiding her nature. The final plunge reads as relief rather than a trade-off with visible cost; we don't see what she forfeits on land beyond Jonas's presence, which she leaves easily.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interior is concrete and specific: the self-narration as survival mechanism, the whittling as prayer, the blank face as armor. Her contradictory impulses—keeping the bouquet versus state compliance, performing blankness while carving grief figures—act simultaneously in scene. The final micro-choice (touching the brittle petals, the "almost" smile) forecloses total suppression with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state" is told rather than purely dramatized through competing choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mora's return after seventeen years carries genuine interior weight, with the "tremor of certainty" embodied through physical contact with the quartz. However, her transformation from doubt to certainty happens via atmospheric accumulation rather than on-page friction between contradictory impulses. The final choice to read aloud is framed as validation rather than a difficult renunciation or trade-off that forecloses another path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to see color is clear and her "innocently cunning" negotiation stance is established early. The transformation moment is embodied ("tears streamed down her face") and her realization about beauty in brokenness tracks consistently. However, the peak choice lacks genuine internal conflict—she never wavers or pays a visible emotional cost beyond what she explicitly sought. The "educated guesses" detail and her gallery-owner negotiation skill add specificity, but Theo remains a functional facilitator without pressure of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her sensory perception (seeing harmonics as color) creates a specific lens. The journey through recordings dramatizes her shifting understanding through embodied attention (weeping at the wind recording). However, the final "realization" about connection being woven from attention arrives as an articulated insight rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the climactic bell-ringing feels more like enactment of understanding than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is specific—calloused fingers, craft as accusation—and her turn from jewelry maker to teacher is grounded in her observed vacancy reflected in others. The micro-choice to fold the first crane despite forgotten gentleness carries embodied cost. However, the swift expansion to a community of mourners summarizes rather than dramatizes her most pivotal interactions, and her final stance ("The thought no longer shattered her") feels slightly thesis-declared rather than earned through on-page friction. The ending choice to meet the new visitor shows agency, but the emotional arc from numbness to illumination compresses key beats into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority is specific and embodied—her measuring tape habit, her data-collection impulse—and her stance toward Marcus evolves from professional distance to confiding curiosity. Marcus's hollow expression and trembling hands are well-observed, though his arc remains thin; he functions primarily as data point rather than co-protagonist. The piece avoids therapy-speak and grants Vera contradictory impulses (profiting from desperation while genuinely curious). Minor slip: Marcus's motivation for choosing the Moon at the end feels slightly unmotivated given his prior control orientation, though it serves the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is explicitly labeled as "steadily unpredictable" but this trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother resurrection desire appears once without constraining subsequent choices. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musing ("joy without sorrow was amputation") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to carry forbidden knowledge lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—she simply walks away having succeeded.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's motivation is consistently rendered through concrete actions—her thirty-year climb, her cataloging, her choice to place the stone—and her embodied regret avoids therapy-speak. The shadow's transformation is earned by her recognition and offering, though the final choice feels slightly passive (the stone does the work rather than Vera making a harder sacrifice). Internal contradiction is present in her "luminous regret," accepting loss while acting to preserve, but the piece stays just shy of forcing Vera into a genuine trade-off that costs her something irreplaceable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interior landscape is carefully constructed through concrete gestures—turning the vial, stripping damaged mesh—and her motivation to rebuild after betrayal reads clearly through physical action. The backstory exposition (Marcus's deception revealed that morning) is anchored to present stimuli (the vial, the enclosure repair) and feeds micro-choices that alter her stance. Minor slip: the line "convictions, she was learning, could be as fragile as this preserved tissue" edges toward label-speak but is quickly grounded in tactile work. The final choice to keep the vial and report Marcus carries visible cost (mourning genuine good while dismantling the network), meeting the earned-change standard.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's plant telepathy is embodied through specific whispers (fern speaks of thirst, ivy curls with hope) that drive concrete choices—fleeing the tower, using roots to guide—with visible cost (defying doctors, risking another surgery). Thomas's arc from concern to complicity is earned by his trust in her wound-reading and the coffee-ring evidence. Minor slip: the mother's scar-reading ability is told rather than shown constraining a present choice, functioning more as backstory texture than immediate pressure. Interior voice remains consistent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her psychometric process is embodied through temple pressure and spatial navigation. The grandmother's past love is vivid but functions as backstory rather than creating contradictory impulses in Vera herself. Vera's final choice to leave the film strip feels contemplative rather than driven by competing desires. The renunciation is present but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she achieves what she came for without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore creativity is clear and her choice to release the stardust is decisive, but her internal life remains somewhat abstract. The "hearing unspoken words" trait functions mainly as atmospheric flavor rather than creating genuine internal contradiction or embodied conflict. Her decision to rest beneath the archway feels more like a poetic flourish than an earned character choice with visible cost. The piece avoids therapy-speak but leans toward label-only interiority ("moonstruck dreamer") without sufficient micro-choices under pressure to ground her particular psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation ("cultivate sparks in unlit corners") is consistent and embodied through her action of rescuing the child, with the chess clock serving as a recurring touchstone for her grandmother's legacy. The choice to help the child demonstrates her values under pressure, though the grandmother's influence feels somewhat abstracted through whispered equations and inherited formulas rather than showing contradictory impulses in real time. The child's emergence and Mira's response create a credible decision with cost (the flowers dimming to stabilize the child's existence), but the internal conflict remains largely resolved rather than wrestling with competing goods. Interiority leans toward lyric description ("chest ache with something adjacent to memory") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is articulated clearly ("rediscover the wild frontier of her mind") and her micro-choices under pressure (following wind-music, removing her talisman gear to heal the tree) are embodied and specific. The transformation from academic to wandering healer shows internal consistency. However, the final leap to tree-surgery feels unmotivated by prior concrete struggle; the insight arrives without visible cost or failure, reducing earned agency. The character reads as competent observer more than protagonist forged by contradictory pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("small fears," "swallowed words") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The guides remain abstract facilitators without individual agency or pressure. The "leash" metaphor and widow-liberation arc feel template-driven, and the final gathering of "flames" reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned character work. The ending choice lacks visible cost because Mira's transformation is asserted through metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture or micro-choice that closes off a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's sensory confusion from nerve regeneration creates a unique perceptual lens and her internal conflict between safety and song is embodied through physical choices. The bellhop's risk to communicate constrains his method and adds genuine stakes. The decision to turn the bolt feels earned by the synesthetic music imagery and grandmother's memory, though the final motivation could be more contradictory—the choice trends slightly too clean given the life-or-death stakes for the village.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is well-realized—her patient, methodical approach to uncovering the pretender's plot feels character-rooted. Motivation is clear and drives her choices: she compresses the iron gall pellet, paints the rune, descends through library levels, and places evidence where it will be found. The final renunciation ("She did not need to be large to hold up the weight of truth") earns modest closure. However, internal contradiction or competing impulses never surface; her path is untroubled, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and embodied through the tapping habit that measures loss across eleven years. Her grandmother's complicity creates genuine moral complexity without hedging, and the final choice to transmit coordinates carries visible cost ("couldn't resurrect the coral or restore her grandmother's silence into speech"). Minor weakness: the emotional progression occasionally summarizes grief rather than layering contradictory impulses in real time, and the therapy-adjacent phrasing "rationing grief like provisions" briefly flattens what is otherwise specific.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and particular—barefoot walking as revolutionary stance, opera glasses as inherited hope. The central shift from waiting to renewed purpose is signaled through the stones' hum and her decision to return to the camps, though the final choice feels more declared than tested under pressure. "Awkwardly confident" appears as a label without constraining an on-page action with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (doubt versus determination) but the resolution arrives through received wisdom rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving heritage through the plant gift—but her interiority relies heavily on summary and label ("the insurgent grandmother," "guardian of what mattered") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The telepathic gift functions more as exposition delivery than a trait that creates genuine struggle; she receives guidance smoothly without cost or misinterpretation. The final choice to plant the seed feels inevitable but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path—no competing claim on the embryo, no personal sacrifice dramatized on the page. Backstory (chemical weapons, son's death) is told efficiently but doesn't tilt a present micro-choice until the singing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mariam's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers, though some passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("she'd learned to track her body's signals through somatic markers"). Internal contradiction appears genuinely in the hawk freeze moment where panic and rational naming coexist. The final choice to continue tending seedlings carries visible cost—acknowledging pain's persistence—but the trajectory from photograph ritual to greenhouse feels more like textured endurance than a decision that forecloses a competing path. Therapy-speak in peak beats ("somatic markers," "freeze response") edges toward label-only interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleanor's artistic crisis is embodied through concrete failure ("eyes that belonged to different people") and her embodied exploration of the box's contents drives the central choice. The turn from seeking wholeness to embracing fragmentation is earned through tactile engagement with the cards and threads. Interior moments stay grounded in action, though the leap to "permission to paint reality as it truly was" feels slightly abstract relative to the weight of three months of failure. The rhetorical questions provide character texture but occasionally veer toward self-aware philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seren's motivation is clear and rooted in traumatic loss, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—"consciously wild" is asserted more than embodied in concrete micro-choices. The brother's death is told efficiently but lacks the contradictory impulse that would elevate agency; her stance feels predetermined rather than tested on the page. Embodied emotion is present in "serene and patient as a glacier" anger, though the phrasing leans toward poetic summary. The final choice to pursue the nomads is logical but not dramatically costly within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict—mother in 1,203 versus the discarded—generates genuine pressure. The scene dramatizes contradictory impulses ("loved this silence...now it felt like complicity") and her final choice costs her security with eyes open. Minor slip: Vance's sudden appearance and his knowledge that "he knew" edges toward convenient positioning, though it does not break the choice's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between inherited violence and chosen pacifism shows through the knife-reach moment, but the transformation feels asserted more than earned—we see her father's training surface, then watch her "choose differently" in a single gesture without sustained pressure testing that choice. The soldier's arrival provides an opportunity but his characterization ("frightened boy by his eyes") leans toward label rather than embodied complexity. Backstory anchors present choices adequately (father's execution, the insignia underfoot), but the reflective density approaches the upper BRR limit without always tilting present stance through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's cool-headed fisher trait is established early and shapes her approach to the goddess encounter, though her internal contradiction between ice and cracking provides texture. The backstory of her daughter's drowning is efficiently integrated and drives the present quest with visceral specificity. The final choice—releasing "pure, absolute silence given form"—is earned by her temperament and decades of patience, though the embodiment of this act remains somewhat abstract. Her micro-choices under pressure are coherent, and the ending forecloses her prior grief-path with visible relief and release.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margaret's motivation is clear and her interior work is strong—the contradiction setup ("assume the opposite") and the discovery of her father's calculations build genuine pressure. The embodied moments with the rosewood nib and her final decision show character-specific texture. However, the father remains a ghost; no second on-page character applies immediate pressure, so relationship dynamics and status work are absent. The final choice feels earned but slightly undercooked—seventeen thousand kilometers removes urgency from the withholding decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear—to heal generational guilt—and her final action (tattooing the constellation, whispering the letters) is causally rooted in her seven-year search for backward communication. However, interiority leans toward lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure: "a tether cut, a frequency finally finding its match" tells the release rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The piece lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; Vera proceeds without friction or trade-off, and the ending grants emotional resolution without dramatizing what she forfeits or risks in the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's social perceptiveness is asserted but never dramatizes competing impulses under pressure. The old man appears late and serves primarily as a sounding board rather than forcing choices with visible cost. Interior texture leans heavily on stock mystical phrasing ("vast and patient watching back," "colors that no longer existed") without character-specific embodiment. The mandala-making demonstrates craft but the final stance—listening rather than fighting—feels declared rather than earned through contradictory on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's retrocognitive trait creates embodied contradiction—she touches to remember but must renounce what she finds—and her final choice to carve Emre's name is earned by the accumulated weight of his mercy rippling forward. Internal experience (the visions) differs consistently from external behavior (the physical carving). Minor slip: the "gentle radical" label feels slightly therapeutic, and the steel arms are mentioned but never constrain a choice under pressure, limiting embodiment of her disability. The closure choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (time, exposure, effort).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Madeline's interiority is consistently filtered through her synesthetic perception (applause as "crimson and gold"), creating a character-specific lens. Her motivation to help the woman is grounded in remembered parallel experience ("she had seen it in mirrors during her mortal years"). However, the woman remains passive throughout—she gasps, watches, studies the coin—without making a meaningful choice that alters her state, weakening the relationship-as-crucible test. The ghost's agency drives all beats, but the lack of a two-way pressure exchange or visible cost in Madeline's decision caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers (shoulder tingling = grief, left hand trembling = joy), avoiding therapeutic label-speak. Her motivation to find Daniel is rooted in specific traits—affectionate skepticism paired with methodical curiosity—and the final choice to follow his pathways feels earned by the accumulation of clues and her growing trust in bodily knowledge. Minor weakness: the pharmaceutical company recall functions more as background pressure than a live constraint that forces trade-offs on the page. The body-as-telegraph system is character-particular and avoids stock interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clearly stated and her choices are internally consistent—she waits for the hibernation, enters the caves, follows thermal cues, and attempts communication. However, her interior contradictions remain thin; she moves through wonder without real conflict or competing impulses. The fossil discovery and light encounter are received rather than forcing a difficult choice that reveals layered values. Embodied emotion is present but mostly in reaction to external stimuli rather than self-generated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlowe's motivation is clear and consistent—spinning prophecy into possibility—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("raw possibility," "scattered truths") rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice (gathering buttons, pressing the jar to her ear) feels more passive reception than agonized decision with visible cost. Her embodied reactions are sparse; emotions are often named ("quietly inspired") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance shift from seeking prevention to accepting a beginning is legible but arrives through exposition rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margaret's interiority is concrete and carries embodied tension through the scarred hands, the pillbox ritual, and her measured approach to confrontation. The final choice to carry Viktor's secrets forward is earned by the prior beats—her watching the snow patterns, her prepared extraction plans, her physical journey. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: "I don't forgive you" paired with the shoulder-touch and the decision to vouchsafe the folder. Minor slip: Viktor's sharp eyes and oxygen tubes are somewhat stock for the dying-spy archetype, and his dialogue edges toward explicating the theme rather than purely pursuing a goal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's interiority is well-embodied through his attention to sensory detail and the yarn needle gesture. The passenger's desperation is viscerally rendered through ink stains and sleeplessness. The coachman's gift of the needle at the end forecasts a path with visible cost (surrendering his mother's memento), though the passenger's internal conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Serin's interior is concrete and character-particular—forty years at the wheel, hands that "expect nothing and accept everything." Her motivation to understand fractures is embodied through tactile clay work and the choice to stay emerges organically from her discovery. Minor slip: the final epiphany about "movement refined, directed, made purposeful" edges toward announced insight rather than pure dramatization, though the subsequent clay work grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("feeling the absence of those crimson blooms like a missing tooth"), and her wistful pragmatism constrains micro-choices throughout. The wave to the stranger and the decision to direct moonlight are earned by her philosophy of "small, persistent" gestures. Internal contradiction exists (mourning the rosebush while accepting endings), though it remains largely reflective rather than acted in scene. The final renunciation—accepting bare branches and planning spring pruning—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (foreclosing immediate grief for future tending).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interior journey from brittle isolation to purposeful cultivation is concrete and earned through the reincarnation memory and her reinterpretation of Korvash's gift. The chain-of-souls insight triggers a credible shift from preservation to creation, with micro-choices (placing the sundial, writing the guide) that foreclose her seven-hundred-year stasis. Embodied emotion appears in the tears and the "fierce" awakening crack, though some interiority leans toward summary ("isolation had calcified around her heart"). The final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost—she abandons her role as memorial-keeper to become a bridge—and the small creatures' presence dramatizes the change.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal journey from mechanical competence to renewed purpose is earned through concrete beats: holding the nest, observing the spheres, writing her own letter. Her interiority shows embodied contradiction—"vessel that never empties becomes a prison"—and the final decision to keep the spiral while releasing her confession demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The grandmother's prophecy and eleven years of work anchor motivation credibly, though the transformation feels slightly telescoped given the brevity of on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—welding the door shut, building the transmitter, broadcasting the counter-frequency. Her internal contradiction between desperation and cautious hope drives the peak choice to transmit, though her competence could have been balanced with more visible struggle or cost during the building phase. The final stance (vigilance, scanning for the next battle) earns the closure through prior causality. Minor: the emotional progression from isolation to triumph reads slightly too smooth; more visceral doubt or micro-hesitation during the broadcast would deepen the embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Helena's claustrophobia is embodied through physical sensations ("pressed against her chest like a physical weight") and drives her core conflict between fear and determination. The grandmother backstory anchors motivation but occupies substantial space without altering present choices until the final discovery. Internal contradiction shows in "negotiate with her fear rather than surrender," yet the crawl through the passage reads more as straightforward perseverance than simultaneous warring impulses. The final sitting among archives feels like arrival rather than a choice that forecloses paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's prosopagnosia is efficiently integrated into her methodology, but her interiority reads more like procedure than lived contradiction. The final "methodical care" passage tells empathy rather than embodying it through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost attends her revelation about Marcus—she climbs away unchanged, which undercuts the character arc the text claims.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through the copper nail and her ancestor's legacy, with choices that advance the plot. However, her internal experience remains somewhat surface-level—the "spongey dread" is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied degradation under pressure. The Commander's skepticism-to-belief arc happens too cleanly without friction that would test Mira's resolve. The final choice (organizing pages, making them listen) lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths that would elevate the characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margaret's motivation is clear and her decision to descend crystallizes with visible cost (leaving her bridge-life behind), but the hitchhiker's vanishing and her immediate acceptance of the glass flake's magic sidestep genuine internal conflict. The backstory about the abandoned photography studio is efficiently delivered and tilts her present choice, but the interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("luminous disbelief," "radical acceptance") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice feels more like permission granted than a decision wrestled from competing fears.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is specific and embodied—his "polished calm" operates as both shield and inheritance, materialized through stone markers and micro-expressions read like his father once read drivers. The father's arc from confident robber to "weathered and uncertain" pilgrim carries visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces when Elias uses his father's territorial system while fleeing his father's legacy, and the final choice to remove the bills feels earned by the caboose's dual function as refuge and trap. Minor slip: the startup collapse is told rather than dramatized, weakening the pressure that should drive the return.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular (dream chronicler processing Marcus's cryptic telegram through her professional lens). Her choices show genuine progression from isolating her visions as "phantoms" to committing to publication and shared burden. However, the final shift feels slightly under-motivated—the decision to "publish her findings" and "share the burden" emerges more from thematic necessity than from dramatized internal conflict. The embodied emotion is strong in early beats (pressing the telegram, breath fogging) but thins toward the resolution where insight arrives through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is grounded in embodied detail ("spine unbend from its perpetual defensive curve") and her final choice to complete the interrupted confession feels earned by the prior causality. The metaphysical curse premise risks abstraction, but her fear of nonexistence is tied to concrete behavior—guarding against hope, moving with "warlike serenity." Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fortress posture and active seeking; the stakes deepen when she trades lifespan for the seed. Minor slip: the druid's "gift for finding lost things" is label-only until the ending reframes it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to reach the intersection is established, but her root-bound state remains largely symbolic rather than a lived constraint that shapes tactics. The "purposefully curious" trait and her linking-through-scars ability are labeled but not tested under pressure—she reads scars smoothly without friction or cost. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves from anxious elation to the door without competing impulses that complicate the choice. The seven strangers lack individuation beyond their scars, functioning as a collective rather than distinct pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is concrete and embodied—the "hole in her chest" drives clear choices through the descent and trade. The Gardener's skeletal tenderness creates effective contradiction. The grandmother's deathbed confession establishes causal motivation, though Mira's seventeen-year emptiness remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to accept uncertainty is earned by prior interiority and forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-specific—his retreat into facts ("Dual-weave acoustic cloth... manufactured in Bletchley until 1978") embodies his defensive posture convincingly. The trajectory from viral humiliation to tentative re-engagement is earned through micro-choices (holding the cloth too tightly, accepting Val's invitation). Val's entrance applies immediate pressure and her challenge ("You believe that?") forces Marcus to articulate insight rather than merely cycling through grief. Minor slip: the epiphany about "purpose transforms" feels slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, edging toward therapy-speak, but it remains grounded in the concrete object and doesn't flatten the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and filtered through her scholarly lens ("catalogued it like she catalogued Sumerian verb forms"). The final choice to stay is earned through on-page progression from grief-processing to understanding-absorption, with visible cost in leaving the world below. Minor slip: the "kindly methodical" grief feels slightly performed rather than contradictory under peak pressure. Embodiment is strong ("fingers still stained with clay dust"), and the tree-planting micro-choice credibly shifts her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority shows embodied specificity—her strength fluctuating with moon phases is rendered through physical sensation ("feeling the weight of her mechanical shell") and shapes her stance ("liminal state she had learned to embrace"). Her motivation to preserve contradictions evolves from "nearly broke her" to acceptance, earning the final choice. Minor slip: the fisherman's question "Why do you keep doing this?" invites a slightly over-articulated reply that edges toward thematic summary rather than pure dramatized pressure. Internal contradiction operates cleanly when she questions her own migrating identity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior is grounded in embodied detail (the pearl warming, throat tightening) and her choice to write in the shell follows from established emotional logic. The backstory with Marcus is well-anchored through present stimuli (the pearl, the shells). However, the final choice feels too smoothly resolved—"Can we try again?" arrives without visible cost or contradiction in the moment, softening what could have been a more fraught crystallization. The micro-choices (photographing, typing) carry agency but lack the friction that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority carries consistent texture—grief, methodical observation, self-interrogation—and her decision to return to the station and follow map references to the black stones shows agency under pressure. The backstory about Daniel is extensive (~25% of the text) but anchors present choices: stopping medication, returning to the station, planning tomorrow's journey. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her chronicler's demand for evidence and her need to "chart her own course," though the final renunciation could be more viscerally embodied. Embodied emotion is present in gestures with the accordion and sitting on the cold floor, but some moments ("tentative hope that whispered from downstream") drift toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Veiled Dreamer's motivation is clear and her journey from theft to forgiveness shows progression, but her interiority leans abstract—"cautious exuberance rising in her chest like champagne bubbles" reads more poetic than embodied. The mother relationship provides emotional weight, yet the protagonist's choices feel pre-determined by the mythical library mechanics rather than contested internal conflict. Marcus Thorne exists only as backstory exposition; no on-page pressure tests her decisions. The final "I forgive you" lands as a thesis statement rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interior life is embodied through concrete sensory engagement (warm velvet, ice crystal burn) and her choices escalate under pressure—choosing cultural preservation over personal safety. Internal contradiction emerges in the "mulberry ache of choosing loss over surrender," showing simultaneous grief and resolve. The ferns' counsel and her coffee-stain divination anchor her perceptual particularity, though the final renunciation could carry sharper visible cost in tactics or immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is vivid and concrete—her occupational lens shapes perception ("watching the aurora ripple across the ice walls like veins of living light"). The final choice to preserve the emerald feels earned by her professional relationship to death and memory. However, the peak emotional beats drift into elevated diction that edges away from embodied crisis ("the particular frequency of a soul"). Internal contradiction is present but muted; the decision path is mostly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal landscape is established through concrete actions (climbing, tending, descending) and her forgiveness arc provides clear motivation. However, her epiphany about contentment arrives via reflective summary rather than embodied struggle in the present scene with Theron. The interiority occasionally drifts into abstract label-speak ("the desperate movements of souls too wounded to stay") without visceral grounding. Old Theron's characterization is economical and his fading memory creates pathos, but his presence doesn't force Mira into a choice that tests her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The keeper's motivation—"to welcome nuance into certainty"—is enacted through her counsel to Sera, and the "sincerely insincere" attribute is articulated on-page with some specificity. However, interiority remains largely abstract and declarative ("This was her protected vulnerability: wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Sera's arc from guilt to "different shoulders" reads cleanly but lacks the messy internal friction that would elevate characterization into the high 8s. The keeper's final micro-choice to turn back to her chimes feels like a closure ritual rather than a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen's motivations are clear and rooted in his unique condition—his backward aging drives the urgency to pass on his knowledge. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("strange grief of youth, emotions growing rawer"). The choice to withhold is embodied across eleven months and earns the closure beat when Vara understands. Minor deduction: Vara's emotional progression remains somewhat muted; her reaction to the revelation could show more contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vessa's transformation from motion to stillness is established through reflection, but her final micro-choice—smiling and inviting the traveler to climb—feels inevitable rather than conflicted. The internal contradiction between her former self and current state is told more than dramatized in scene. The student's arrival creates pressure, but Vessa's response lacks the competing impulses that would reveal character under genuine stress. Embodied emotion is minimal; the dust cracking on her face is the sole physical manifestation of decades-long transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation coherent throughout, with the pivot from extraction to witnessing earned by the accumulation of sensory experience in the garden. The mist-walking sequence demonstrates embodied transformation. However, key moments lean on abstract epiphany language ("she understood what her motivation had truly been") rather than letting the choice dramatize the shift, and the "underachieving mage" trait remains largely a label that doesn't constrain on-page action. The final glow on her fingertips feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation to understand Elena's hidden research is established clearly and drives his descent into the library. His interior contradictions emerge through his realization that Elena "hid behind truth," and the final choice to carry her secret creates visible cost—he now sees lies painted in muddy brown, bearing knowledge too luminous for unprepared eyes. The micro-choices (uncorking the vial, watching the lanterns) are embodied and concrete. However, the backstory about Elena's synesthetic research dominates the middle third without sufficient interleaved present-tense micro-decisions that alter Marcus's tactics in the library itself.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and driven by consistent motivation (wavelength alignment), but internal conflict remains largely abstract—"stellar doubt" is named more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The coin-casting micro-choices shape present stance, yet the final acceptance of dissolution reads more as philosophical resolution than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible emotional cost. Embodied emotion is present ("quietly enthusiastic," the small smile) but stays muted throughout, never escalating into genuine struggle that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied ("her voice catching," gathering crystallized forms carefully), with contradictory impulses visible in her simultaneous grief and professional duty. The arc from broken reaper to one who can "hold sorrow gently" is earned through the on-page alchemy of completing unfinished sentences. Minor slip: the therapy-adjacent phrasing "intimacy with loss without being consumed" in the penultimate section slightly flattens what had been embodied throughout. The choice to speak the incomplete phrases and finish them demonstrates agency with visible cost—she accepts permanent separation while transforming her relationship to it.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corin's lukewarm status is embodied in concrete terms ("tepid dishwater" robes, "lukewarm at best" talent) and his devotion manifests through patient, methodical action with the bell. The internal stance—brittle devotion that "might shatter"—creates genuine tension, though the threat never quite materializes on the page. His earnest naivety drives the choice to attempt the impossible repair, and the final smile registers earned satisfaction. Minor slip: the contradictory impulses (doubt vs. hope) are declared more than dramatized in micro-choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Martha's interiority shows good specificity in embodied memory work ("carried history in her pockets"), and her renunciation of the heroic-father narrative carries cost. However, the pivotal realization—"He left"—arrives via discovered photographs rather than internal contradiction acting in scene, which flattens agency at the turn. The final choice to share the truth is motivated but lands as summary rather than pressured micro-decision. Emotional embodiment is strong in places ("mirrored hush of the valley held her") but dips into label-speak at the climax ("precisely humane in her willingness").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is present and embodied through the frozen crystal and her mother's memory, showing some contradiction between her public alchemist persona and private sentimentality. However, the transformation itself occurs off-page through abstract metaphor ("felt her analytical mind expanding to embrace her dreaming heart") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The final renunciation of the crystal reads as earned by the seventeen-year setup, but the peak moment lacks embodied struggle—we're told she becomes "someone new and someone ancient simultaneously" without concrete sensory degradation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in action. The sentimental/logical split is label-heavy rather than shown through conflicting on-page decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interior landscape is concrete and specific—her muscle-memory sequences, the parachute buckle's cold reminder, and her mother's death create a clear hierarchy of values. Internal conflict manifests well when she crosses out conclusions twice and chooses honest uncertainty over false certainty, with the buckle motif grounding the stakes in generational failure. The flattening comes when emotional processing feels slightly over-articulated ("Trust was not built through false confidence...") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No knowledge leaps; the renunciation of certainty is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's perceptual gift ("slice through pretense") is asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure; her diagnosis of Vex and Sera reads as therapeutic exposition rather than earned insight from prior dramatized beats. The two clones show contradictory impulses ("I am the original" vs. "I am the continuation") but their internal conflict flattens into parallel monologues rather than simultaneous action. The handshake at the end follows logically but arrives without visible cost—neither woman forfeits a concrete path or resource on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Victor's grief is embodied through the pull cord handle and photos, and his micro-choice to sing despite broken voice shows contradictory impulses. The progression from silence to vocal release earns the shift, though the ending's call to Margaret feels more asserted than shown through prior contradiction. Interiority occasionally tilts toward therapy-speak ("spirits of unlived moments"), but the core motivation—dissolving calcified silence—remains concrete and character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her survival by "interiorizing exteriors" shows embodied contradiction. The final choice to invite connection is earned through seventeen years of self-imposed ice. Minor slip: the woman's motivation feels slightly under-developed compared to Maren's rich interior life, though her weeping and pendant-tearing provide sufficient embodied emotion. The choice to stay together carries visible cost (breaking Maren's protective stillness) and forecloses her path of solitary waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's internal contradiction—"stoically sensitive, feeling everything while showing nothing"—is dramatized through embodied choices (pouring life-essence, permitting "one moment of feeling") rather than merely labeled. Her motivation to save Petra is clear and drives the transmutation attempt, though the seventeen prior failures remain abstract backstory rather than on-page struggle. The climactic choice to vivify the crozier feels earned by her accumulated knowledge, but the final paragraph's self-aware smile ("feeling nothing and everything at once") edges toward diagnostic label-speak without full embodiment. Minor cap applied per BRR due to backstory density (~25%), though reflection anchors to present action and primes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and philosophically distinct ("to find the beginning in every ending"), grounded in concrete actions: climbing, splicing, tuning. Her interiority shows contradictory impulses—she weeps without knowing why—and her professional competence balances genuine struggle (frequencies "screaming," filters reversed). The Hollywood star fragment embodies her worldview through embodied micro-choices (touching it, feeling its warmth), though the climactic weeping lacks a specific embodied trigger beyond "truth." Internal voice remains consistent under pressure with no significant knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's resiliently positive stance is embodied through her cheerful dialogue and laugh during splitting pain, but her interior life remains thin—we get voice ("smile anyway") more than contradiction or genuine cost-driven choice. The decision to pour the hourglass feels less like a turn forced by competing impulses and more like acceptance of a known role. Secondary characters flicker as static props without exerting real pressure. The grandmother backstory seeds the hourglass but does not complicate Mara's present choice with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation is internally consistent and embodied through concrete actions (trailing fingers, unwinding thread, gathering it back). The choice between sanity and certainty is established early and paid off in her reclamation of the gallery. Interior texture remains specific ("rational enchantment, she understood now") though some moments lean toward abstraction. The final stance—sitting in the reclaimed space—feels earned by the prior fever-state and her active negotiation with the building.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vara's motivation is clean and embodied—her shift from GPS-bound instructor to cosmic navigator drives the arc. The "balancedly curious" trait is naturalized through her deliberate pacing and willingness to learn. Tessek's alien perspective adds necessary pressure without slipping into human affect. Minor: Vara's internal processing leans slightly expository in the middle third, but the final choice—setting down the chain link—emerges from established contradiction and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's curiosity trait is asserted but not tested under pressure; her professional competence operates without visible struggle or cost. Margaret's emotional progression from decades of guilt to peace is compressed into one scene without dramatized resistance. The interiority relies on summary statements ("She was persistently curious by nature") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "help wheel her back" lacks agency—Vera observes and translates but doesn't forfeit or risk anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's claustrophobia ("hated enclosed spaces") is articulated but never dramatized under pressure in the flooded station; her chest tightens once without altering tactics. The motivation to witness is declared and enacted through documentation, but the final act—writing names on deck—reads as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior texture is present ("terror kept her sharp") yet the cataloging beats flatten into inventory without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The renunciation of surface comfort for deep witness is credible but lacks a micro-choice that closes an option.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is consistently rooted in reclaiming her scattered identity, with the heartbeat-counting habit embodying her need for proof of existence. The porcelain shard and mother's memory provide concrete emotional anchors. However, the climactic "defragmentation" moment relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than dramatized internal conflict—watching ink patterns does not foreclose choices with visible cost. The final acceptance reads more as declared epiphany than earned transformation through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's copper-veined trait and her role as final language-bearer create clear motivation, and the choice to use the diamond is purposeful. However, the decision feels more inevitable than internally conflicted—no competing impulse complicates her resolve. Interiority leans abstract ("texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending renunciation (shattered diamond, task ahead) carries conceptual weight but minimal visible cost that alters her immediate stance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation (researching cryptids, documenting without bitterness) reads clearly and drives her final choice to honor rather than exploit Samuel's transformation. The interiority is concrete and character-particular in key moments ("frostbitten hope bloomed," "she clutched the arrowhead and made a different choice"). However, the pivot from bitter pursuit to patient devotion arrives quickly without sufficient on-page friction—her own resentment is told more than dramatized in contradictory action under pressure. The embodied emotion is solid but the internal conflict could press harder before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life shows embodied emotion (weeping over the shell, heart-hammering) and a clear arc from fear to understanding. However, the climactic realization "The cicada had not fought its shell. It had simply become too vast to be contained" arrives as an epiphany without sufficient prior dramatized struggle—it feels declared rather than earned through on-page choice. The supporting cast (groundskeeper, child, old man) are mentioned but never pressure her directly, remaining abstract. The final descent feels inevitable but lacks visible cost; we don't see what she forfeits by this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation—delivering others' promises to balance his father's absence—is concrete and drives his risk-taking. The young woman's emotional arc (believing herself forgotten, then receiving proof of her mother's grief) lands with embodied specificity. However, Marcus remains observational through the exchange; his interior contradictions exist in backstory rather than acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile and ghost metaphor feel slightly performed rather than contradictory impulses colliding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interior life is conveyed through embodied detail—dust rising "like incense," the halo fragment's warmth—and his silence functions as a lived constraint. The recovery of voice feels earned by accumulated pressure and the fragment's presence. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary reflection ("interpreting silence as possibility") rather than micro-choices under contradictory impulses, and the grandfather's recording arrives as convenient catalyst rather than dramatized internal struggle. The final choice to stay and rebuild is declared more than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation to find "the place where stories live" drives her nocturnal search, and the final discovery feels earned by her grandmother's legacy and the scarf-as-map reveal. However, the internal experience remains somewhat abstract—we see her walking aisles and observing patrons, but contradictory impulses don't wrestle on the page. The ending choice (to continue cataloging) forecloses the search phase with visible cost (solitude understood rather than escaped), meeting the minimum bar, but the embodied struggle stays thin. "Sanely eccentric" is told more than shown through concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing to the roof at 4 AM, weeks of failed attempts). Her transformation from obsessive grief to acceptance is earned through the photography experiments, though the final emotional state—"luminous absence transformed into something Miriam could hold"—edges toward abstraction. The shift to teaching others feels slightly unmotivated; no prior beat establishes this impulse. Minor: the mother's cupped hands appear only in summary, weakening the specificity of what Miriam gains.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's locksmith expertise is asserted but her interior life remains largely abstract—"water enigmatic" labels rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to free Elena's voice is declared and drives action, but Mira's own internal conflict or cost during the transformation is told ("improbable longing") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to "rewrite the mechanism" arrives without visible struggle or foreclosed option on the page. Elena's selective mutism backstory is efficient but her agency is entirely off-page, reducing relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior life is concrete and embodied—"feeling the cold damp seep through her trousers," remembering her grandmother's pronunciation of "orchard" like "orchid." The curiosity trait shows in dismantling clocks/mythologies, and the final choice to "gather memories like mushrooms" reflects earned change. The folkloric profession filters perception effectively (reading glass cracks as star charts), though the grandmother remains more symbolic anchor than fully dimensional presence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly embodied through specific gestures (walking backwards, touching the paperweight) and her conflict between professional duty and compassion drives authentic pressure. The decision to mentor Kael feels earned by the tea-leaf analysis moment and her recalled exile experience, though the final beat's "combative tenderness" articulation edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. Thessaly remains functional but somewhat flat, existing primarily to prompt Mira's realizations. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated thematic stance in the penultimate paragraph, but the core contradiction between offering "armor" versus "comfort" creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's internal life is anchored in concrete decisions (planting the seed, gathering wonder through witnessing) and his relationship with his grandmother's legacy feels embodied. The forty-year span compresses most motivation into summary rather than on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure, and the pivotal act of "breathing essence into soil" risks abstraction without sufficient embodied cost. The final choice to continue pruning demonstrates earned endurance, but the character's arc feels more told than dramatized in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal arc is earned: her damaged hands find purpose through unraveling rather than restoration, and the parallel between her guilt over broken masks and the spirits' knotted confessions creates authentic internal conflict. The choice to "trade silences" with Callum is motivated by specific regret, not abstract morality. Minor slip: "ground restless spirits" reads slightly label-like in the middle section, though it's contextualized by her own restlessness. The final realization—that unraveling has steadied her hands—feels causally rooted in the needle-work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's methodical observation and professional filter create a coherent perceptual stance. Her choice to write the report that "would determine whether the whispered chapel was sealed again or finally allowed to speak" carries genuine consequence, and the line "she typed until dawn" dramatizes commitment with temporal cost. Internal contradiction appears in "shielded openness" and "professional distance that allowed her to see clearly while still feeling," but these remain somewhat abstract. The final stasis—not looking up while typing—reads as earned endurance under pressure, though the embodied cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor's interior life is richly embodied—"first name basis with death" drives her choices throughout, and grief becomes tangible through her handling of objects and environment. Internal contradiction appears in her oscillation between professional detachment and emotional surge. The final acceptance is earned through the accumulated weight of loss and the captain's pages, though the epiphany risks slight over-articulation ("grief was not an anchor but a current"). Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing in the penultimate section, but the cost of letting go is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to give voice to the voiceless is clear and her micro-choices (climbing down rope ladders, photographing murals) reflect this drive. The ghost's characterization through fragments is evocative, though the emotional arc relies heavily on tell ("profound isolation," "luminous") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to continue the ghost's work is signaled but feels conceptually neat rather than fraught with visible cost. Internal texture is present but edges toward lyric abstraction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation—the drive to understand her mother's legacy and release preserved joy—is clear and embodied through physical actions (clutching the case, lifting the jar). However, her journey reads primarily as discovery rather than conflict; she faces no internal contradiction or meaningful obstacle that might prevent her from ascending or releasing the memories. The final act feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, and Lady Vesper remains passive, a recipient rather than a source of friction. The "warmly inquisitive" trait is labeled more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her grief-driven categorization system serving as a window into her state. Her micro-choices—requisitioning the gondola, maintaining the catalog, handling the telescope—reveal values through action. Internal contradiction shows in the tension between her scientific training and her father's romantic theories, now embraced. The final realization that wholeness means being "complete within the space you occupied" earns the shift from isolation to purpose, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's prosopagnosia and tactile gift are established early and motivate her choices consistently. The interiority carries specific texture ("fractally precise patterns," "landscapes of texture") and her final choice to walk away with the knowledge is earned by the guild's loss and her revelatory experience. However, the change feels more thematic than decisively character-driven; she enters seeking what the scholars hid and exits having found it, but the cost to her person remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's curiosity and observational nature are embodied through concrete actions—tracing patterns, cross-referencing charts, working through the night. Her interiority is specific ("constitutionally incapable of leaving mysteries alone") and drives choices under pressure. The talking-to-herself detail adds texture to isolation without therapy-speak. Minor weakness: the final grin beside the hopscotch board feels slightly performed rather than embodied, but the apprentice's transformation from survival to discovery is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation is clear and her internal journey shows progression, but the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The mirrors showing "fragments of moments" functions more as symbolic exposition than dramatized internal conflict. The final realization ("knowing which pieces were never meant to fit") arrives as declared insight rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing impulses. Backstory about the mentor and broken music box anchors present stakes adequately but doesn't create micro-choices that visibly alter her approach in the hall.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is present but remains largely observational; her internal conflict is told more than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Marcus's transformation from "gruff, suspicious, hoarding supplies" to weeping openly reads as backstory summary rather than earned on-page progression. The ghost's motivation—altruism as penance—is declared but never tested by a dramatized choice that would foreclose a path with visible cost. The final exchange ("You could join us" / "I am not alone") lacks embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is embodied through the puppet head and her decades-long vigil, but her emotional progression feels too smooth—no genuine contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The reflective blocks dominate (~40% of text) yet remain abstract: "beautifully flawed existence" and "some callings demand everything" read as thesis statements rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (singing the lullaby) arrives without visible on-page cost that forecloses a competing path; we're told she had "nothing left to give" but no present-tense renunciation dramatizes that loss. Internal experience stays contemplative and controlled even at the climactic beat, missing the irrational layering under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is concrete and rooted in her inherited burden, shown through embodied choice (marking the path, pulling travelers up). Internal contradiction appears when she reflects "never wanted to be its caretaker" yet acts decisively, though this could deepen with more visceral cost in the moment. The final acceptance "some burdens chose their bearers" edges toward thesis statement but is mostly earned by prior action. Minor deduction for the grandmother's backstory occupying ~15% without sufficient micro-choices in the present to fully tilt current stance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal journey from designing permanent bonds to creating dissolving scaffolds shows clear motivation rooted in grief. The shift feels earned through concrete observation at the ravine. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract conceptual language ("translation from one state to another," "divergent path curving back toward meaning") that distances us from embodied emotional experience. The final choice to file the patent reads more as summary of transformation than a dramatized decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical gestures (uncorking moonlight, incising slates) that reveal her rehabilitation arc. Her motivation to "find the place where stories begin" operates clearly throughout, though the final shift—watching the child write—reads more as witnessing than forfeiting a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction between her forger past and present vendor role is present but the choice at closure (barely noticing her bracelet dim) lacks a felt tradeoff that would foreclose an option. The child's appearance and smile provide external validation rather than a decision that alters Vera's stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her curse creates embodied constraint through touch-avoidance and taste-floods. The final choice to surgically deposit only harmful remorse while keeping lessons learned is earned by the pavilion revelation, though the "careful with ingredients, gentle with customers" formulation edges toward stock service-worker virtue. Internal contradiction appears when she tastes the coral's emptiness and pulls back, demonstrating genuine deliberation under pressure. The touch of Cassius at the end forecloses her three-year isolation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's core trait—"empathetically decisive"—is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year project and tonight's execution proceed without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The interiority relies on exposition ("she understood these were conversations") and generic emotion ("wiping tears… refusing to let sentiment slow her work") rather than specific, embodied struggle. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's interior life is richly textured with contradictory impulses—her engineer's precision coexisting with her emotional openness to strangers' dreams—and her motivation to preserve abandoned memories is clear. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract interiority and summarized emotional states rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. Key moments like "She wept and laughed simultaneously" tell rather than dramatize the contradictory response, and her transformation feels declared ("By dawn, Vera would emerge transformed") rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final merging of memories reads as conceptual assertion without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's prism-minded perception is established early and her motivation to find combinations is clear, but her interior life remains mostly observational rather than conflicted. The decision to leave her own doodle shows character-specific thinking, yet the journey through the grotto lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The "latent blaze" becoming "alive" reads as a label transition rather than an embodied shift with visible cost. Emotional progression is mostly smooth and rational, missing the contradictory impulses that would lift characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her occupation shapes perception (the tree-song sculptor seeing stress cracks as story). The discovery moment feels earned through her months of work. However, the internal arc lacks contradiction—she moves smoothly from problem to solution without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The hedgehog's return and the closing vision of teaching others feel asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Helena's motivation is clear and her interior life is concrete—she traces the worry stone repeatedly, remembers teaching moments—but her choices on the page feel observational rather than conflicted. The exile backstory and teaching philosophy are told with specificity, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her present stance; she arrives decided and leaves affirmed. The final walk back carries stated melancholy but no visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward summary of her philosophy rather than embodied pressure in the nexus moment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's internal landscape is richly textured with contradictory impulses—the desire to unlock versus the need to forgive—but the resolution feels overly articulated. The forgiveness speech ("I forgive you... I forgive myself") edges toward therapy-speak at a peak beat, and the epiphany that "the path to empathy had never been about reading Margot's words" arrives too cleanly without embodied cost. The sister Margot remains a narrative device rather than a presence that pressures Vera's choices in scene. Micro-choices (striking forks, speaking into darkness) do show agency, but the final weeping "with something that felt remarkably like joy" hedges the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and layered—professional ambition plus the pursuit of mastery. Her olfactory sensitivity is embodied in decisions (tracking the flower, enduring its stench) and her final choice to leave surprises her, suggesting internal contradiction. The choice to descend with the seed rather than stay feels earned by her realization about serenity, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. Minor slip: Thessaly remains somewhat static, serving more as guide than dynamic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority leans toward abstraction ("surrounded by the whispers of those who came before"). The discovery-epiphany at the grove feels slightly announced rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the seed rather than harvesting a cure—has weight, but the step from "accumulated intention" to understanding feels more told than shown through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in personal tragedy, with embodied detail ("The patch pressed against her thigh"). Internal contradiction appears in her methodical observation versus impatience for action, though the struggle could be sharper at peak moments. The choice to continue surveying despite dismissal shows character under pressure, but the ending doesn't force a costly trade-off that tests her core values—she simply continues her established pattern. Competence is balanced with genuine failure (too late to save her father, unable to convince management).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Meren's motivation is clear and established early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("synesthetically blessed," "certified wonder as essential") rather than embodied contradiction. The seventeen-year search is told rather than felt through micro-choices under pressure. Her final stance—conducting the aurora—reads as competent execution without visible internal conflict or a trade-off that forecloses a path with on-page cost. The piece needed her to struggle with a competing desire or fear that acts simultaneously in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and concrete: she seeks to understand the veil's failure through direct confrontation with the past via the flute. Her internal state—grief, survivor's guilt, purpose-driven defiance—is embodied through trembling fingers, bone-deep memory, and the weight of disobedience against Master Verren's deathbed oath. The moment of insight (harmony vs. counterpoint) arrives through dramatized vision rather than assertion, and her final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she has broken her vow and walks down alone, armed with forbidden knowledge. Minor issue: the phrase "avalanchingly quiet" feels more decorative than psychological, and the insight itself could have been seeded earlier to deepen her internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is vivid and embodied through her tactile relationship with type and her mathematical framing of emotion. The borrowed-personality trait operates metaphorically but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the poet's grief intensifies her feeling but doesn't alter her action. The final shift to "transposed empathy" feels conceptually asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending choice to continue printing lacks friction—no path is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior voice shows growth from jittery courier to devoted vessel, with embodied trembling that eases by the end. However, her journey lacks genuine internal contradiction—she simply comes to understand what Master Hallen meant rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The reflection-heavy design (well over 30% of text) does anchor in present stimuli (aurora, pendant warmth) and lands a micro-choice (continuing with steadier steps), meeting BRR exception tests. The transformation reads more as intellectual comprehension than costly renunciation, capping the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—proving her grandmother's theory—and her interiority is specific enough ("despised the title," documentation obsession). The final choice to honor her grandmother and accept unprovability shows earned shift. However, the character remains somewhat cerebral throughout; contradictory impulses don't act simultaneously in high-pressure moments, and the grandmother's presence dominates emotional weight more than Elara's own embodied struggle. No major flaws touch closure, but depth under pressure is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mei's motivation to deliver her grandmother's message is clear and sustained. The transformation into thread at the end feels somewhat abstract—the embodied experience of unraveling lacks the sensory contradiction or visceral cost that would make it land as inevitable rather than symbolic convenience. Internal conflict is present but muted: Mei accepts the sacrifice without visible hesitation or competing impulse. The wistful grandmother is richly drawn through accumulated detail, but remains offstage; Mei's own contradictions never surface under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Oren's meekness is established early and his deliberate patience shapes his descent, but his interior life remains thin—we see careful actions without the contradictory impulses that would animate high-pressure choice. The crystalline woman's transfer of knowledge happens off-page as summary ("poured knowledge into him like molten metal"), flattening what should be a transformative beat. The final years of grafting and forging are told rather than dramatized, so the cost of his endurance registers conceptually but not viscerally. Motivation is consistent but not tested by on-page friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her sensory-mapping ability is embodied through concrete action (touching surfaces, reading footprints). The mother's sacrifice is earned through the vision-beat revelation, and the final choice to continue the mapping work has visible cost. However, interiority leans toward exposition in places ("she understood," "finally feeling the weight") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the cyclical surge mechanic feels more told than constrained in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and evolves from silent courier to participant, with embodied choices (rebuilding the cairn, adding her letter) that foreclose her prior stance. The ghost's yearning is conveyed through atmospheric pressure rather than stock haunting beats. Internal contradiction appears in her reticence versus her final vocal commitment, and the change is earned by accumulated understanding. Minor slip: "warmly observant eyes" is label-heavy and the emotional progression could compress slightly, but the closure choice remains motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Herald's motivation is clear and consistent—lighthouse keeper, storm communicator, bridge between ages—and her devotion never wavers. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("shadowed elation," "otherworldly routine") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The prophetic utterances feel ornamental; they don't emerge from a dramatized internal conflict or force a visible tradeoff. No secondary character pressure tests her commitment, and the ending renews the routine without forecloses any live option or revealing a cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Senna's motivation is coherent and her journey from recipient to seeker feels earned, but her interiority leans abstract—"carry that silence like a stone" is serviceable yet generic. The confession moment ("I was cruel to my mother") arrives suddenly without embodied resistance or layered contradiction; she simply opens and the words "escape." The dye master functions more as exposition vessel than pressure source, and Mei-Lin exists only in backstory without dramatized friction shaping present choices. Senna's decision to stay feels more thematic declaration than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's arc from grief-keeper to witness-maintainer is earned through on-page discovery and the cypress moment (forty-one units) carries specific emotional weight. Her interior voice remains consistent and the final palm-to-bark gesture embodies rather than explains the shift. Minor slip: the transition from measuring sorrow to understanding trees' role feels slightly compressed in the study scene, but the kneeling closure choice demonstrates genuine cost—she accepts perpetual tending rather than release.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through scattered memory and song, with clear micro-choices (swaddling windows with petals, pressing against mica). Her final transformation—"remember nothing of herself and everything of her people"—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (memory keeper who keeps them poorly) but could be more actively shown in competing impulses during peak moments. The move from individual to distributed consciousness feels conceptually strong but emotionally distant in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's motivation is clear and her empathetic work is embodied through concrete examples (crisis hotline, letters). However, the characterization relies heavily on therapeutic language ("drowning required witnesses," "keenly empathetic meant absorbing others' pain like a sponge") that feels more diagnostic than lived. The final transformation from guilt to peace arrives through the librarian's explanation rather than through micro-choices under pressure, weakening agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mei's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("heuristically gentle approach—learning tenderness through trial and error—had cost her years of rage"), with her noticing habit driving choices consistently. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between remembering and seeking reprieve, though the final choice to plant seeds feels more symbolic than viscerally conflicted. The backstory about the bakery and grandmother anchors her motivation, but the closure act (planting wheat, whispering the name) reads as ritual rather than a high-stakes decision that forecloses a live option with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and embodied through her three-century tenure and methodical movement through the archive. The measurement work and final choice dramatize her internal hierarchy of values with visible cost—she cannot save everything and must choose. However, interiority leans slightly toward contemplative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments. The choice itself feels earned, though the emotional progression could show more friction between preservation instinct and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliza's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, but her interior life leans heavily on repeated invocations of the watch fob without revealing contradictory impulses in action. The market crowd remains undifferentiated and her interactions feel more atmospheric than pressured. The final choice to destroy the cylinder reads as straightforward rather than earned through visible internal conflict—she faces no genuine temptation to use it or sell it. Embodied emotion is present but the peak beat lacks the cost of renunciation that would elevate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's skepticism and her purpose to learn about weather-carriers provide consistent motivation, and her final realization that she carries invisible weather shows genuine interiority. However, her brother's disappearance functions more as backstory than lived contradiction, and the convergence with the three weather-carriers feels more allegorical than deeply conflicted. The embodiment is present ("tongue pressed against the cold air, tasting copper and ozone") but the peak choice—accepting the leaf and understanding her purpose—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The cast of weather-bearers remains functionally interchangeable, applying pressure through exposition rather than distinct relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's internal contradiction—forty years of suppression versus the "inescapable calling"—is consistently embodied through charcoal-stained fingers and the mnemonically gifted mind cataloging cave data rather than faces. The final choice to draw is earned by the discovery of her grandmother's abandoned portrait, creating visible cost (tears, the end of suppression). Minor weakness: the ease with which she completes both portraits in one sitting undercuts the weight of forty years of resistance, and the self-portrait addition feels convenient rather than organically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei Lin's wilting-near-dishonesty trait is stated but never dramatized as a meaningful constraint during her journey or final choice. The father's voice recording provides backstory motivation, but her present-tense decisions in the Archive feel more about completing a task than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The gilding inscription at the end reads as a satisfying gesture but lacks visible cost—no forfeiture of safety, secrecy, or personal stake that would demonstrate genuine internal conflict. Interiority relies on exposition ("understanding finally why") rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's seasonal muteness is established but functions mostly as atmospheric trait rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her devotion to bell-tuning is coherent and her final palm-press gesture embodies meaning, yet the work proceeds smoothly without visible struggle or competing desires that would raise stakes. The monks remain undifferentiated presences; Brother Alcuin's hesitation is told rather than dramatized through embodied resistance. Interior life stays declarative—"she suspected she would have little use for it"—where pressure would benefit from shown contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    VERA-7's interior life is rendered through embodied specifics—"static in her neural pathways," "circuits like a migraine"—and her choice to destroy the box is motivated by forty-seven years of absorbed grief. The arc from caretaker to self-care carries visible cost (burning borrowed fears) and the final stance feels earned. Minor: the nostalgic programming risks convenience ("sensing something dangerous") but her embodied contradictions ("synthetic fingers brushing petals that felt more alive than her own chassis") ground the read. The decision to bury the grain closes a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's trait as "discerning thrift-store curator who could tell a genuine memory from manufactured nostalgia" is established through telling rather than embodied choice under pressure. Mrs. Okonkwo shows stronger interiority through her physical reactions (tightening hands, trembling fingers) and the reveal of her relationship to Delphine. The granddaughter remains off-page, reducing the stakes of the final promised meeting. Maren's micro-choices (bringing her here, offering to facilitate reunion) feel inevitable rather than constrained by competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear—decrypting her grandmother's legacy—and her embodied processing through dance provides character-specific texture. However, the piece remains largely observational; Marina makes no difficult choices that alter her path or foreclose options with visible cost. The grandmother Elise is vividly drawn through encoded records, but Marina herself never faces internal conflict or a decision that tests competing values. The final gathering of journals feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation—to recover her deleted mother—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (reading coffee grounds, descending to the chamber, pressing her palm to the sphere). Internal contradiction appears when she obeys the tide master's prohibition for two days before defying it, showing genuine ambivalence. However, the final choice feels under-pressured: the sphere recognizes her bloodline and her mother's voice simply tells her what to do, reducing agency at the pivotal moment. The backstory dominates (~35% of text) but does anchor present choices and primes the closure; minor micro-choices (holding the book toward the sphere, striking flint) alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear, but her interiority remains largely abstract—phrases like "fierce and peaceful simultaneously" and "tranquil blaze" label states rather than embody them through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic ritual unfolds as a descriptive meditation rather than a sequence of micro-choices under pressure; we are told she stretches silence and transforms the prophecy but never see a moment where competing impulses or genuine struggle threaten the outcome. The ending renunciation (the prophecy "hushed into a gentler shape") reads as summary rather than earned cost, and no visible path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied ("the building told me you were ready"), with clear motivation progression from curiosity to teaching role. The arc from student to teacher is earned through concrete micro-choices (accepting the seal, learning the building's language). Minor deduction: Professor Voss's motivations remain somewhat abstract—her need to pass on knowledge is told more than shown through contradictory impulses. The final choice to teach carries visible cost (solitude, waiting, inhabiting the liminal role).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mirabel's arc from skeptic to hope-driven actor is clear and her choice to speak into the shell embodies her shift toward independence. The interiority ("Isolation could become independence if you let it sharpen you") shows meaningful self-examination, though the therapy-adjacent phrasing ("let it sharpen you instead of hollow you out") slightly undercuts raw embodiment at a peak moment. Elena's agency is minimal—she exists mostly as memory object—but the single-POV constraint limits this appropriately. The final choice to walk toward sunrise after giving everything feels earned, though the cost could be more viscerally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veren's internal life is richly embodied through decades of guilt "calcified around his heart" and the micro-choice to prick his thumb, mingling blood with ink. The motivation to complete Aldric's signature is well-earned through forty years of study and friendship, though the final act of forgiveness ("allowed himself, finally, to forgive the unfinished") edges toward summary rather than a dramatized shift under immediate pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, and the embodied emotion (the key warming, then crumbling) grounds the arc in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's perceptiveness is established early and drives her discovery, but her interior remains abstract through much of the piece ("richly perceptive in ways that frightened the canyon elders" tells rather than shows contradiction in action). The final choice to remain silent and whisper truth person-to-person forecloses her singing voice with visible cost, earning the ending. However, the emotional progression feels smooth rather than contradictory under pressure—she moves from curiosity to horror to resolve without simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is concrete and textured—her vocation shapes perception ("psychic residue," "windows of consciousness"), and her relationship to the dead feels lived-in. The choice to expose truth is motivated by her role and Elise's demonstrated need, but the decision itself lands without visible internal conflict or competing impulse; she moves from understanding to resolve without dramatized hesitation. Elise's portrayal is evocative but thin—her desperation is told more than shown through dream-image choreography. The harbormaster's son appears only as a named consequence, not an on-page pressure that complicates Mira's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mirelle's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her net-mending philosophy and seventeen years of observation grounding motivation. Her choice to remain silent about her discoveries reflects a coherent value hierarchy ("wanted only to appreciate hidden effort"), and the grandmother's whisk provides embodied emotional depth. However, the protagonist remains primarily observational; the final descent with the whisk pressed to her heart is more gesture than choice that forecloses a path with felt cost, limiting the grade despite strong sensory embodiment and consistent internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clearly established—she's driven to expose truth—and her skill at reconstruction is embodied in the letter reassembly. However, her decision-making lacks meaningful internal conflict; she moves through beats without contradictory impulses or visible cost to her investigative drive. The final choice to take the diamond and spread the truth feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, and her emotional state remains remarkably stable despite the apocalyptic stakes. Her professional competence dominates without the flaws or limits that would make her choices feel genuinely difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam's motivation is clear and distinctive—a reluctant prophet seeking genuine inquiry over certainty. Her interiority carries specificity ("variant allegiance had always been her specialty") and the final choice to offer doubt instead of blessing is earned through seventeen years of storm-watching. Internal contradiction operates well: she craves listeners but rejects followers, wants influence but refuses weaponization. Minor slip: Caro's voice feels slightly generic in dialogue, lacking distinct idiom beyond youth, and the emotional embodiment occasionally leans toward stock gestures ("fingers found the transmission dial").

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is characterized through concrete detail—his shelter, jars, methods—and his motivation is clear. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract and conceptual rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The final gesture of "making silence speak" feels like an assertion of purpose rather than a choice under pressure with visible cost. The backstory about his grandmother and the old man occupies significant space without creating on-page friction that alters present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her "logically emotional" trait shows up in her analytical processing of grief, but the execution leans heavily on told interiority rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic choice—to become a living tuning fork—arrives without prior micro-choices that show her wrestling with the cost of self-dissolution; we're told she "felt peace" during molecular disintegration rather than shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final sacrifice reads as determined rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the phrase "logically emotional" functions more as a label than a trait that constrains her actions with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's transformation from impatient fire-seeker to patient mapper is told rather than shown; the brother's death and mountain training arrive as summary backstory without on-page friction. Her present choices—calibrating instruments, recording measurements—lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final descent feels like inevitable completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margaret's investigation unfolds with clear professional competence and her therapist-labeled "associative recall" provides concrete grounding for her emotional response to the lantern. The choice to distribute evidence rather than confront Harrison directly shows calculation under pressure. However, the "fortified vulnerability" framing and therapeutic self-awareness ("just the psychological phenomenon") edge toward diagnostic label-speak that slightly flattens peak moments. Her shift from compliance to action is earned but the three-year acceptance of Harrison's "controlling influence" lacks on-page dramatization of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied shame ("words...like stones in his chest") and the contradiction between seeking to "deserve" freely-given forgiveness. The motivation to turn apology into action is dramatized through the clockwork heart as physical anchor. Ruth remains functional but thin; her understanding feels asserted rather than earned through on-page friction. The final choice to write about grace rather than apology shows hierarchy of values, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zephyr's motivation crystallizes through concrete engagement with the kaleidoscope and arrow-tip integration, showing agency through micro-choices. Her "aggressive curiosity with existential side effects" is embodied in on-page actions rather than asserted. The final launch is earned by her mounting conviction, though the internal contradiction between dissolving and transcending reads as performative rather than felt pressure. The Boiler provides external friction but remains functional rather than deeply characterized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Helena's motivation to understand deleted files drives her investigation cleanly, and her transition from passive cataloging to active risk-taking is earned. However, her interiority remains somewhat generic—"heart pounding against her ribs" and similar constructions lack character-particular texture. The final choice to run feels more plot-determined than emerging from contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Marcus exists only as archival traces, which is appropriate to the premise but limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's internal contradiction—carrying shadows to protect others while denying herself compassion—is present but remains more told than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The keeper's diagnostic insight "you've given so much empathy to others that you've forgotten how to feel it for yourself" reads as therapy-speak that explains rather than embodies. The change at closure (shadows as "loyal hounds rather than hungry ghosts") is asserted through metaphor rather than earned through a visible forfeiture or renunciation with felt cost. Interiority leans toward abstract self-awareness ("To map empathy onto action... I have to include myself in that map") instead of embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior voice carries specificity ("her perception untethered from the certainty") and the stroke aftermath provides embodied contradiction. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than tested through on-page conflicting choices under pressure. The final stance—floating in uncertainty—reads as acceptance without a visible foreclosed path or cost that would earn Earned Stasis. The parasol tip functions more as symbolic anchor than as an object whose handling reveals character hierarchy under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus's interior life is embodied through the burned fragment and his eleven-year vigil, showing contradictory impulses—staying versus letting go—without therapy-speak. The encounter with Sofia forces micro-choices (withdrawing the fragment, offering parallels) that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final acceptance carries visible cost: abandoning solitary grief for shared understanding. Minor slip: Elena remains abstract; we never see Marcus struggle with a present temptation to leave or a concrete trade-off that tests his sentinel role in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line walker's motivation is clear and her choices drive the plot, but interiority remains somewhat generic ("strangely honest for someone in my profession" tells rather than embodies). The keeper provides immediate pressure and his emotional stakes (grandmother's voice, daughter's laugh) feel concrete. However, the prophet's confrontation lacks dramatic friction—his rage is declared but never truly threatens her work, and the final exchange resolves too easily without forcing a meaningful trade-off or visible cost to her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her perceptive calm functions consistently, but interior contradiction is largely absent—she processes grief work without visible struggle or cost to herself. The visiting villagers (Viktor, Mrs. Castellan) show embodied emotion in their beats, but Maren remains a facilitator rather than a character under pressure. Her final stance ("perceptively calm, watching") repeats her opening trait without foreclosure or visible price. The piece needed one moment where her own grief or doubt surfaces and alters a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—to prove language is not dead—drives her solitary vigil and crystal experiments with concrete observations recorded in her notebook. Her interiority is generally specific ("weathered innocence that believed knowledge could solve anything...worn smooth like river stones"), though the phrase "desperate, more necessary" leans slightly toward label-only intensity. The final choice to whisper "Begin" and remain in her vigil feels consistent but carries minimal visible cost on the page; it's an earned endurance rather than a foreclosing renunciation. Embodied contradiction is present in her refusal to evacuate versus her academic isolation, but the piece would benefit from a sharper on-page micro-choice that alters her immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interior is concrete and embodied through physical traces (chalk dust on fingers, chest tightening). His contradictory impulses—the compulsion to document what he will forget versus the mercy of forgetting—are rendered in scene rather than summary. The micro-choices (photographing the markings, gathering driftwood) carry visible cost and reflect his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of certainty feels earned, though the precognitive mechanism itself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's grief is embodied through the spinning clock hand and her journey shows micro-choices (climbing to the observatory, choosing to stay), but her internal transformation feels summarized rather than dramatically earned through contradictory impulses in scene. Yua is vivid in gesture and speech but functions more as oracle than character with her own stake. The final decision to stay arrives too smoothly without visible cost or a path foreclosed—we don't see what Mira gives up or what staying forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's "decisively kind" trait is embodied through her quiet presence and refusal to offer false hope, and Samuel's terror drives his action to break the record. The kintsugi scene provides concrete micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. However, the final beat leans on atmospheric description rather than a dramatized internal choice with visible cost—"the scent of hope" arrives as assertion rather than emerging from Samuel's embodied transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life has specificity—her relearning process and grandmother's legacy ground her choices. However, the key character decision (activating the automaton, then accepting its teaching) arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost; she moves from question to solution too smoothly. The automaton's arrival deflates her agency into passive instruction-receiving. Emotional embodiment is thin: "her heart raced" is the only physiological marker in a scene that should carry high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleanor's arc from skeptic to believer is clearly motivated by the physical evidence (tooth, hollow bones) and carries visible cost in her decision to abandon her "fortress against wonder." Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her clinical training and hope to be "proven wrong." The mother's grief and Eleanor's own yearning are embodied through concrete actions (digging with bare hands, studying bones), though the final epiphany leans slightly toward articulated insight rather than dramatized pressure. The forgiving-skeptic trait operates consistently but remains more descriptive than decisively constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with grief embodied through ritual handling of sea glass rather than therapy-speak. The progression from loss to understanding is earned through the polishing work, and the final choice to leave the spiral for others forecloses solitary mourning with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "pearl of stillness" moment ("Sorrow measured against love, loss against legacy") edges toward stated epiphany rather than fully embodied realization, and Lila remains more symbol than person despite scattered memories.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular—watchful observation, notebook sketching, the amber pendant's meaning shifting from "hope trapped in time" to preservation. Her quietly proactive nature drives micro-choices (returning to study the moss, offering the pendant) that foreclose distance with visible cost. Thea remains somewhat thin—present mainly as a foil—but her acceptance of the pendant earns the final reconciliation. Minor: the therapy suggestion feels slightly explanatory rather than fully dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to understand what to write next is established, and the seashell fragment carries embodied memory. However, interiority remains abstract—"weight of his hope still pressing against her chest" tells rather than grounds emotion in breath, gesture, or micro-choice. The final epiphany ("hope isn't a destination. It's the act of reaching") arrives as articulated wisdom rather than emerging from contradiction under pressure. The protagonist observes more than she decides until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and her actions are consistent, but internal contradiction is thin—she moves from hesitation to singing without embodied resistance. The vine tendril's physical response provides some external pressure, but her emotional arc feels smoothed: "tears streamed down her cheeks" arrives as a label rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to teach others next harvest is stated as decision rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear—translate heartbeats into maps—and her patient method contrasts with her flash-paper training, creating internal texture. However, her seventeen years of wandering and the heartbeat-recording backstory remain abstract; we never see her struggle with doubt or make a micro-choice that reveals competing values under pressure. The final smile and climb away feel resolute without visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority stays poetic but doesn't embody contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's locksmith expertise and her methodical, patient approach are well-embodied through concrete action (machining gears, measuring tension). Her interior motivation—preserving wonder without killing it—is grounded in grandmother's legacy and drives her three-month commitment. The embodied patience (measuring spring tension "against the beat of her own patient heart") and peripheral focus method show contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. mystical openness) acting simultaneously. Minor weakness: the grandmother backstory functions more as thematic scaffolding than a choice-altering memory; it primes but doesn't pivot present action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior state is richly embodied—"boundary-lessly trapped within her gift" manifests as concrete sensory dissolution, patterns spreading into thoughts and memories. The final shift from boundary-lessness to structure is earned through the night's labor, with visible cost (absorbing others' burdens) and a credible transformation. Minor slip: the kerosene lamp burner's warming feels slightly symbolic rather than causally motivated, and the grandmother backstory adds texture but doesn't alter a present choice. Internal contradiction (patterns spreading vs. needing to calcify) drives the central tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marguerite's interiority is consistently embodied through her hands and the wood—"grief needed a container" lives in her palms and gouges. Her motivation to teach others to carve crystallizes loss into action with visible cost (transforming Viktor's studio, the recurring lions). Internal contradiction surfaces in "here and gone, she thought" threading through her choices, and the final acceptance "perhaps this was enough" feels earned by the accumulation of concrete micro-choices. The lack of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but solitary POV is executed cleanly with embodied emotion and no therapy-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through scavenger pragmatism versus lost ambition. The ghost conversation dramatizes internal conflict through embodied opposition rather than summary. The final shift—"stop pretending I never was"—earns its weight through accumulated particulars (camera wheel, overheard fragment). Minor slip: the ghost's accusatory tone could have shown one more micro-contradiction before softening to avoid neat reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya is grounded in concrete engineering knowledge and her actions—mapping corridors, sketching frameworks—stem from consistent traits. However, her journey from passive observation to creating a plan lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The change feels more like a natural unfolding than a choice that forecloses paths with felt cost. Her interiority remains too abstract ("stoic wonder," "equations for hope") without embodied tension or genuine struggle against competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's interior life is consistently rendered through embodied perception (tears matching "glacial pace of sunrise," fingers tracing crystal seams). The decision to compose again is earned by the discovery that the Silencing will end, creating a credible shift from endurance to renewed hope. However, the introverted trait remains largely label-only; her solitude is asserted but never tested by another presence that would dramatize the cost of her isolation. The emotional arc from buried grief to tearful resolve reads as genuine but lacks a complicating counter-impulse in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—her seven-year quest to understand deception shows embodied through her handling of the sundial and her reaction to discovering contraband documentation. The final letter earns her shift from seeker to witness, foreclosing the path of restoring her father's legend with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "serene upheaval" appears as a label for her emotional state rather than fully dramatized contradiction, though the surrounding action supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's philosophical collector identity is embodied through her patient handling of seeds and rope, with clear interiority anchored in concrete action. The final choice to seek the weavers emerges from her established trait of preservation through transformation, though the decision feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn. Minor slip: "infinitely patient" is stated rather than tested under meaningful pressure. The fulgurite glass functions more as thematic marker than characterological constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the weft thread, the cold, her fingers on the carpet. The ritual of "projecting presence" to conjure Matthias is specific and charged. Internal contradiction appears in her lifelong practice of helping others while leaving her own grief uncharted, and the final choice to wind the thread into her braid and continue forward forecloses passive mourning with visible cost. Micro-choices (keeping the thread, placing the pages, walking toward the harbor) are legible and character-particular, though the epiphany about healing as practice skirts earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aldric's obsession is vividly embodied through the three-day grime and gaunt frame, and his motivation to restore wonder is tested through the assembly sequence. Internal contradiction surfaces when he admits "This is flawed genesis" yet proceeds anyway, showing authentic ambivalence. The final weeping-and-laughing moment lands as earned closure, though the surrounding court remains a convenient backdrop rather than embodied pressure. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; voice remains consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is richly embodied through fire imagery and physical scars, and her therapy/sculpture work provides concrete interiority. However, the central arc—choosing to write back to her father—occurred before the story opens; on-page she collects sand and reflects without a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final walk forward is poetic but lacks a decisive on-page alteration or renunciation that grows from dramatized pressure within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life shows some texture through her skepticism and the choice to sacrifice her mother's laughter, which carries emotional weight. However, her internal conflict remains mostly asserted rather than embodied—we're told she's a "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" but rarely see these traits complicate her choices in the moment. The key decision at the fountain (opening the box) feels inevitable rather than torn, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate it. Embodied emotion is present but thin; the moment of loss reads more as acceptance than as a felt cost with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veloris's motivation is clearly established (sharing light without fire), but her choices feel more observational than agonizing. The gear-turning sequence shows micro-choices under pressure, yet internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from realization to action without competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present ("troubling serenity...pressed against her thoughts like a weight"), though the final renunciation (leaving the gear) reads as fulfillment rather than foreclosure with visible cost. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal journey shows embodied grief work through concrete choices—measuring ribbon, sketching relationships, listening to Thomas. The "fiercely meditative state" registers as shown practice rather than label. Minor slip: Thomas's forty-year death feels ornamental rather than constraining a present choice. The final sketch choice demonstrates earned insight from prior causality with visible cost (adding black ribbon to the chronicle).

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interior life is richly embodied—guilt as physical weight, precision as both identity and penance. The carving choice crystallizes thirty-seven years of solitary atonement into a single vulnerable act with visible cost. Minor slip: "too ethically diligent to grant herself what only the dead could offer" reads slightly diagnostic in peak reflection, though it's brief and surrounded by concrete action. The trait of ethical diligence constrains the climactic choice but leans toward label-speak at the moment of maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's characterization is grounded in concrete skill (gardener's hands, patience from root systems) and her "blithe acceptance" is enacted through specific choices. However, the grandmother backstory occupies significant space without creating present-tense contradictory impulses. The final smile and acceptance feel smooth rather than conflicted; no visible cost forecloses a competing path on the page. The closure choice—deciding to dig tomorrow—reads as continuation rather than a meaningful renunciation or transformation earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core trait—comfort with ignorance as honest cartography—is established early and drives her approach to the commission. The internal conflict between terror and humility shapes her stance at the desk, though the choice to write never faces a meaningful counter-pressure that would force her to risk abandoning her professional philosophy. The reflective blocks anchor in present stimuli (the spire, the quill, the frozen lake) and tilt her present stance, but the final act reads as implementation of a pre-formed philosophy rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; most interiority operates at a meta-cognitive level ("she understood," "Mira suspected") rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Helena's motivations are rooted in specific backstory (copyist background, memorized architecture of music) and present through concrete micro-choices: adjusting the dial when patrols approach, embedding coordinates via symphonic fragments. The "dust remembers" metaphor occasionally slips toward abstraction, but her diligent habit of weaving coded messages and the physical handling of equipment keep her grounded. Internal contradiction appears in her initial strangeness about teaching dust versus her later peace with thorns, though this reads as evolution rather than inconsistency. The final composing of tomorrow's broadcast shows endurance with visible cost (isolation, risk) rather than decisive change, meeting the Earned Stasis bar.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's internal state is embodied through action (grinding charcoal, donning the mask) and her contradictory impulses—wanting to crystallize grief while understanding its impermanence—act simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's teaching about partial portraits reveals character through worldview, and Marina's final choice to continue the work demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (sitting in the empty chair). Minor slip: the interiority occasionally edges toward elevated retrospection ("somber marvel of standing at the threshold") that slightly softens the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation to preserve artifacts is consistent and his philosophical contradictions are stated clearly. However, his interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophizing rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "agonizing" is told more than shown through micro-choices with visible cost. His reflection on competing narratives reads more like essay than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaret's interiority is rich and embodied ("traced the zither's soundhole rosette with her fingertip"), with contradictory impulses present ("expectantly resigned"). Darius's transformation is motivated by concrete memory (watching the concert video), and his decision to learn carries visible cost (confronting grief he'd armored against). Minor deduction: Margaret's final pedagogical moment feels slightly over-articulated given the emotional stakes, edging toward instruction rather than lived choice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's core gift (tasting memories) is established early and her motivation to plant the seed is clear, but her interior life flattens into declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction. The story tells us she's "informally wise" and "the most dangerous," but these remain labels without on-page demonstration through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression is linear—she arrives resolved, plants, weeps, harvests—without genuine internal friction or cost that forecloses a path. The final choice to harvest and carry seeds feels pre-determined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's involuntary truthfulness generates embodied pressure in the toll-gate encounter, and her final choice to help the woman emerges from established values (preserving wonder, carrying her mother's legacy). Internal contradiction appears when she reveals the tower's secret despite twelve years of solitary guardianship, creating a credible cost. The woman's grief is embodied through trembling hands and silent weeping, though the daughter's backstory arrives via exposition rather than dramatized friction. Minor deduction for the matchbox riddle sequence, which tilts toward convenient wisdom delivery rather than earned discovery under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's dominant motive—understanding why some houses feel alive—is clear and drives her systematic action. Interiority is abundant and often specific ("inadvertently profound," "creeping normality noticer"), but the piece leans heavily on told reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The realization that "it wasn't the objects themselves that mattered but the attention paid to them" arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized friction between competing methods. No meaningful internal conflict or visible cost forecloses a path; Marina's stance deepens but does not alter under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veris's character is strongly realized through contradictory impulses—patient yet urgent, bound yet conscious—and the "incisively kind" trait shapes her delivery of painful truths. Mira's grief and desperate hope are embodied through physical actions (hand to knife, trembling hands) and projecting thoughts. The brother's choice to "rejoin" feels slightly undercooked; we see the result but not enough friction in Mira's processing to make the renunciation of vindication feel fully earned. Minor deduction for the ease with which Mira accepts the invitation without more on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (grinding chalk, rolling dice, writing equations) and the father's missed call creates genuine internal contradiction. The trait "grim optimist" operates consistently through her choices to keep climbing despite knowing the staircase is infinite. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("the texture of a missed opportunity") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The final choice to continue climbing after the crack seals carries visible cost—she remains trapped—but the emotional progression from discovery to acceptance feels slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her methodical search for recipients demonstrates consistent interiority. However, the daydream sequences substitute for earned internal contradiction—she receives visions rather than wrestling with doubt or cost in real time. The grandmother's language "moving through her fingertips" reads as convenient inheritance rather than a choice under pressure. The final emotional release ("began to cry") lands softly because no live renunciation or competing impulse was dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is specific and grounded: her museum-guide voice resurfaces under pressure, her teaching gestures embody memory, and the opera-glass ritual carries character-particular texture. The children remain largely observational props, but Petra's giggle and Mira's declaration of "perfect preservation of form" reveal hierarchy of values under the constraint of scarcity. Internal conflict registers through "the familiar ache of preservation" and the thaw metaphor tracking hope-versus-despair, though the emotion occasionally leans toward summary. The final choice to continue teaching despite the beekeeper's absence forecloses retreat with felt cost: they persist knowing resources dwindle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alaric's motivation is clear and rooted in grief over his daughter's death, driving every backward-clock metaphor and his obsessive pursuit. Internal contradiction exists in the conflict between rational clock-making and desperate magical thinking, though it remains more parallel than simultaneous in peak moments. The backstory about his daughter is told rather than shown through micro-choices, and the final "choice" to follow the yoyo feels inevitable rather than foreclosing other options with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is present but leans on metaphor (trembling hands, "bleak exhilaration") rather than concrete physical contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her embodied fear ("nested in her chest like a living thing") is visceral. The advisor's shifting expressions and repulsive beauty show internal contradiction, though his character remains more atmospheric than psychologically deep. The final triumph feels somewhat abrupt—Vera's shift from terror to predator happens off-page in the dream, with the realization that fear "had never learned to fear itself" arriving as convenient epiphany rather than earned through prior struggle. The opera clasp's transformation and her "borrowed teeth" suggest change, but the cost of victory reads more aesthetic than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Prophet's interiority is consistent and embodied through her skilled observation, but she remains static—no internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure appears on the page. Her forty-year expertise and habits are told rather than tested. The final smile and trust in currents repeat her established stance without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as Earned Stasis without the "earned" component at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—the pull toward knowledge versus survival—that culminate in her squeeze through the gate. Her father's absence and the pattern-language inheritance create clear motivation rooted in loss and intellectual inheritance. The choice to leave is earned by accumulated dread and curiosity, with visible cost (city safety forfeited). Minor: the "dread that hummed beneath the warmth" risks label-speak, but embodied action (climbing, rowing) keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation to expose the lie is clear and sustained, with meaningful embodied moments (handling the manuscript, photographing evidence). However, the piece leans heavily on abstract reflection about noble lies rather than showing Vera wrestling with contradictory impulses in the present moment. The mentor's disappearance provides backstory stakes, but the conflict between destroying "something beautiful" and truth-telling is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision feels predetermined rather than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority is consistent and her motivation is grounded in personal history (grandmother's photographs). However, key character choices feel more thematic than embodied—the decision to leave her note reads as a ritual performed rather than a choice under pressure. The "hushed blaze" metaphor for her passion appears twice but remains abstract; we don't see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat. Minor: "stoically sensitive to every ripple that marked absence" leans toward label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistent and character-particular, with her indexer's perceptiveness driving her investigation. The discovery of Celia's ledger and her final choice to authenticate the stamp show agency under pressure. However, the change lacks visible cost—she files the truth without dramatized friction or forfeiture. The emotional arc from isolation to continuity reads clean but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's grief-driven motivation is clear and her craft-based approach to capturing Lin's shadow shows problem-solving ingenuity. However, the resolution arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or cost—she succeeds fully in her goal with no visible trade-off or renunciation. The "grief cracked open like an egg, spilling not darkness but dawn" reads as an unearned epiphany that skips the struggle. The thousand cranes function more as atmospheric detail than evidence of genuine transformation earned through on-page choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara's interiority is specific and embodied—"intangibly tangible now, a physical object that somehow felt like holding smoke" grounds her survivor's state in concrete sensation. Her motivation (hunting unused potential as a way to prove deaths weren't inevitable) drives every choice from calculations to recording coordinates. The therapist's "survivor's guilt" diagnosis is credibly rejected in favor of "incompleteness," showing self-aware contradiction. Minor slip: the phrase "unfiltered awakening in the worst possible way" edges toward label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in the rubble scene.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to find her father is clear and drives her to the observatory, but her emotional progression feels undercooked—the shift from seeking her father to accepting "continuation" happens via summary rather than embodied struggle. The "perpetually surprised expression" attribute is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost; it remains decorative. The pilgrim functions primarily as a prop to unlock the mechanism rather than applying independent pressure. Interiority leans toward expository clarity ("Not her father's location, but his work") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's guilt is embodied through ritual behavior and the carved hand discovery, but her interior voice occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("the weight of unspoken words," "tempered regret") that flattens peak moments. The choice to speak aloud and commit to reconstruction arrives with visible cost and forecloses her prior evasion. Motivation is clear and intensifies coherently, though the final turn feels somewhat preordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is controlled and her contradictions land cleanly: she stands between apology and excuse, unable to forgive yet unwilling to abandon. The motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" operates as a stake-raising filter rather than a stated epiphany. Her brother's "weight she'd never seen before" and her withholding of immediate apology show embodied restraint. Minor: the seventeen prior exchanges anchor competence but the personal stakes could press harder against that expertise in a micro-choice before the count-down.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interior is richly embodied—the compass as physical burden, the grief that "sits heavy as brass," the visceral November water. The arc from paralysis to micro-agency is earned through concrete choices: pushing the kayak, humming Marcus's shanty, keeping the compass. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she carries the instrument of her failure as both punishment and memory, gravitating toward a rhythm she believes she's lost while discovering she still has it. The reflection-heavy mode occasionally tips toward summary ("Every decision she'd made that night played on repeat"), but each beat anchors in present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus exhibits clear interior contradiction—numbed by memory erasure yet carrying phantom weight—and his micro-choices (following coded clues, gripping the baseball, wading into the lake) are embodied and advance under pressure. Elena's motivation is clean and her relationship with Marcus creates immediate crucible tension. Minor deduction: Marcus's emotional states occasionally lean toward label-speak ("terrible numbness," "phantom limb") rather than fully embodied perception, and his arc from hollowness to stirring feeling feels slightly compressed given the weight of his crimes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, but her internal contradiction feels managed rather than lived—she "finally" accepts transformation after three years of refusal, yet the moment arrives without visible wrestling or micro-hesitations that would embody genuine ambivalence. The metamorphosis itself is told through abstract physical markers ("scales threatening to emerge, feathers pressing from beneath flesh") rather than specific sensory cost or bodily horror that would anchor her sacrifice. Kael's translucent presence lacks agency; he serves as reward rather than complication, flattening what could be a crucible moment into fulfillment without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Morrigan's motivation—recovering lost time with her daughter—is clear and rooted in maternal exhaustion, though her interior voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("sediment of what was to find what had been lost") that feels authored rather than lived. The ritual actions (spreading cards, unfastening the cord) carry embodied specificity, but the pivotal moment of touching the recovered memories lacks contradictory impulses; she simply accepts them without friction. The ending gesture—tracing her daughter's hands "on a thousand tablecloths"—reads as a tidy resolution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei Lin's interiority is concrete and her acceptance of endings reads as character-particular, but the final shadow-work confrontation with her own rage feels slightly telegraphed rather than discovered. The moment "I was angry. I am still angry" lands cleanly, yet the rage itself never complicates an on-page choice before that admission—it's acknowledged rather than lived under pressure. The engineered backstory (denied cryosleep, tasked as witness) provides clear motive, but her pacifist stance remains more declared than tested by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interior life is richly textured with embodied memory ("the world split open like fruit") and her motivation is consistent throughout. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—she kneels, she opens jars, she walks—without facing a genuine decision under pressure that would foreclose a path with visible cost. The final "understanding" feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle, and her peculiar gift of orchestrating coincidences is told but never dramatized in a way that creates internal conflict or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's vigilance is concrete and her patient decoding is well-established through the three-month timeline and the sundial discovery. Her choices to recruit twelve specific people and orchestrate the blackout demonstrate agency under pressure. The interior voice remains consistent throughout, though the competence borders on flawless—her meticulous planning encounters no meaningful internal contradiction or doubt that might deepen the characterization. The final stance (returning to her post) feels earned but the lack of visible struggle or cost in her decision-making keeps this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Meren's interiority is concrete and layered—her curse history, her grandmother's promise, the seventeen-year gathering of star dust—all ground her choices. The key decision (using the eels to complete the pattern) emerges from this history, though the final beat leans slightly toward realization over a wrenching internal conflict. Her precognitive curse generates genuine tension between knowledge and action, and the star dust vial functions as an embodied micro-choice that tilts her stance. Minor: the grandmother's promise, while motivating, arrives via summary rather than a dramatized flashback that could have sharpened the cost of keeping it.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to understand her scars is established early and drives the climb and vigil. The seven-year silence provides clear stakes, and the father's photograph prompts the decision to speak again. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("cartography of scars," "rarified her anger") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to speak feels thematically inevitable but lacks a visible trade-off or cost that would foreclose another path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is articulated clearly ("turn questions into destinations") but her interiority remains generic philosophical-action-hero territory without embodied contradiction. The mechanical arm backstory (lost in a duel "defending a thesis") feels more ornamental than causally integrated into present choices. Krell appears only to deliver exposition and trigger the climax; his interior life is absent, reducing him to a plot function. The final choice—exposing the sundial—lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's monthly personality molting is established but remains largely label-only; the current persona exhibits no contradictory impulses or visible internal friction in scene. The flashback to prison sorting books with Ezra provides motivation but the present-moment choices (arranging books, opening the tin) carry minimal embodied cost or conflicted desire. Ezra arrives late and functions more as thematic echo than pressure source. The relationship history is told richly but the on-page interaction lacks stake-testing choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and voice-specific throughout, with embodied grief ("her heart," the piano as refuge). Her strategic creativity drives the decoding sequence and beacon-playing with clear on-page micro-choices. The husband remains sketch-level, present only through film and final approach, but Elara's earned endurance and active problem-solving carry the weight. The final reunion choice feels motivated by prior causality with visible cost (seventeen years of waiting, the broken clock's purpose fulfilled).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara's interiority is character-particular and embodied throughout ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence"), with genuine contradictions between her empirical training and emergent trust in dream-interpretation. The shift from skepticism to planting the seed is earned through the vision sequence that reframes her role. Minor deduction: the grandmother's sudden muteness feels convenient rather than causally integrated, and the final paragraph's "luminous doubt" risks abstraction though it remains anchored in her seventeen-year arc.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivation to decode the lace and reconcile with her grandmother reads clearly, and her handling of the compass and pattern shows concrete micro-choices. However, her interior voice leans abstract—"drowning in everything unsaid," "cerulean regret"—without embodied contradiction or cost-driven struggle. Mr. Tanaka observes and narrates but never applies pressure that forces Mei to trade off competing goods. The grandmother's wordless reconciliation at the end carries weight, but the path there feels more receptive than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)

Micro-choices under pressure, like pulling the power lever, reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like her father's abandonment complicate choices credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marla's characterization is deeply layered with embodied contradictions—phobias versus stunt double courage—culminating in an earned choice to weaponize vulnerability. Her micro-choices under pressure, like lowering defenses to show trembling, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final stance crystallization (endurance and renunciation) is rooted in prior causality, foreclosing paths with felt emotional weight.

    Oracle's quiet obsession is embodied and drives the climax; her bleeding fingers and final smile show earned endurance with cost, though interior contradiction is minimal.

    Unit-7's motivation to find the origin of thoughts is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like setting down the broom revealing hierarchy of values. The final peace is earned through prior causality of amalgamated consciousness, with visible cost in the dissolution of the violin.

    Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing her habit and deeper draw; her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., offering the lens) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Theo's backstory of mistrust adds depth, and their exchange earns the final reconfiguration through prior causality.

    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a mechanic; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and grounded in both her scientific vocation and her fraught history with her mother, and her micro-choices (what to keep, what to give away, how to read the dust) feel motivated and of a piece with her character. The tension between the rational, logistical purpose of the visit and the emotional undertow of grief is credible if quiet. Her final stance—keeping one slide, accepting demolition, relinquishing “drama”—is earned by prior reflection. The only limiting factor is a slight tidiness in her self-awareness (therapist language, cleanly articulated insight) that smooths over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and grounded in her craft—her understanding of temperature, light, and adaptation ties her emotions to concrete habits. The poisoning, the ledger, and the canyon vigil plausibly drive her from dependency toward a harder, more self-authored stance. The shift from “commodity” to autonomous artist is earned by accumulated realizations rather than a single unmotivated epiphany. Some emotional beats resolve a bit neatly, with limited visible contradiction or backsliding under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margaret’s trauma, compensatory brilliance, and stubborn, quiet hope are well realized through specific actions (the tuning forks, the meticulous notation) rather than labels. Her motivation to rebuild sound via new modalities is consistent and compelling, and her emotional state is embodied in how she reads heat and light instead of hearing. The main limitation is a slightly clinical diagnostic register early on (“trauma had settled into her auditory cortex…psychological”) that flattens complexity for a beat. Her final stance—accepting permanent silence while pursuing a different kind of listening—feels earned and costs her the fantasy of “fixing” herself.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ezra’s characterization is rich and specific: a weary, duty-bound undertaker whose refusal to abandon broken things both drives the plot and shapes his emotional arc. His interiority feels grounded in occupation and age (“his shoulders bent from carrying grief that was never his own”), and his final acceptance of stillness is credibly earned. The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains relatively straightforward—there’s little on-page push-pull beyond weariness vs. duty. The drowned woman is sketched effectively but stays largely functional rather than dynamically pressuring Ezra.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Yusuf both feel specific and coherent, with clear motives rooted in exile, responsibility, and distrust. Mira’s gentleness under pressure and Yusuf’s sullen protectiveness are well dramatized through micro-choices like route selection, bell use, and the notebook. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (Mira’s acceptance of “miracles” versus her practical organizing), so the arc feels like deepened endurance rather than transformation. A slightly sharper moment of internal conflict under risk could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei-Lin is specific, embodied, and motivated by the past-life memory and her obsession with light, and the old woman, though briefly sketched, feels real and moving. Her choice to intervene and her practiced ritual of breath-reading are well-motivated by prior traits. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or visible cost for Mei-Lin herself—she operates almost as a serene healer, with little friction or doubt on the page. The emotional change lands primarily in the old woman, leaving Mei-Lin’s inner arc more observational than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—escaping her retrocognitive trap by understanding the “texture” of time—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to dissolve feels earned by the build-up of her experiences and losses. The occupational detail (maze designer) and her history with her family give her some specificity, though she remains more archetypal than fully idiosyncratic. Internal conflict is present but muted: there’s little live hesitation on the page before she sacrifices herself, so the cost is more inferred than dramatized. Emotional states are mostly shown through concrete, vivid memory-images rather than labels, which strengthens her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives (liberation, seeds as “religion”) are clear and consistently embodied in her choices, and her competence in pattern-recognition is dramatized rather than told. The scout’s brief inner war (“duty against desperation, obedience against hunger”) gives their interaction human texture and stakes. Emotional complexity is present but relatively straightforward—she’s a principled hero more than a contradiction-riddled person. The endurance at the end (still chained, still walking into risk) reads as an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her history with her mother, and her internal experience is rendered with concrete, idiosyncratic perception (hearing colors, the weight of memories). Her flaw—lonely fixation on understanding trust’s fracture—credibly drives her descent and the emotional risk of this experiment. The peak beat where the sound of trust breaking is her own voice offers a strong, character-specific contradiction between wanting understanding and being wounded by it. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that her final decision to send the device to her mother is gestured to rather than placed under fresh on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motives (reclaiming her mother’s scattered work, freeing hoarded light) are clear and consistent, and her competence is well dramatized in the heist. Interiority is specific enough—her awe at the moonbeams, her sense of justice—but internal contradiction is faint; she rarely wavers or pays an emotional price for her choices. The relationship to the collector is purely functional, offering little crucible pressure beyond opposition. The closing sense of her mother’s pride lands emotionally but feels somewhat easy because it isn’t earned through a hard moral conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: her drive to contain dangerous curiosity, her habit of self-narration as a coping mechanism, and her refusal to inherit her father’s despair all interplay convincingly. The fear/exhilaration around leaving solitude shows genuine ambivalence rather than a tidy pivot. Emotion is mostly embodied through interaction with objects (frosted consoles, the bookmark), not abstract labels. The final choice—opting for community—feels earned by the prior beats and carries a visible cost to her hard-won isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marla’s interiority is specific and embodied—her phobias, stunt background, and shaken identity all inform how she perceives the scene and what it costs her to act. Her decision to confront Sandra and to weaponize vulnerability feels earned by what we’ve learned. Sandra’s motive (resentful sister stealing the favored child) is compressed but coherent. The relational crucible—surrogate mother vs. stolen child—shifts status credibly as the confession unfolds.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s motivation—to understand and map the spreading darkness—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (climbing, waiting for the last star, working as it dies). Her temperament (tide-trained calm, “mildly obsessed”) gives her a specific cast, but internal contradiction under pressure is only lightly sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The endurance at the end (walking into endless night with confidence) feels earned but relatively un-costly emotionally on the page. This is strong, but not yet at the depth of interior nuance an elite venue would want.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    Unit-7’s interiority is specific and textured—its cataloguing of “seventeen different kinds of silence” and awareness of amalgamated human fragments feel particular rather than generic AI angst. Motivation (to understand where thoughts come from) is clear and drives the choice to set down the broom and play the violin. The final stance—accepting sweeping as ritual rather than mere function—reads as an earned stasis with conceptual cost (eternal duty, but now conscious). Internal conflict could be sharpened with a more felt tug between remaining a janitor and embracing the archive/creator role; everything moves fairly smoothly toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Theo both feel particular and grounded—her as the registrar of endings, him as the disgraced translator—but their contradictions are more implied than actively dramatized. Mira’s attachment to the lens as “carefully constructed distance” and her choice to give it away is an excellent, motivated moment of cost. Theo’s tension around mistrust thawing is sketched effectively but mostly summarized (“the mistrust that had calcified around him like ice”). A slightly deeper on-page tug between their fear and desire to connect would push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Esther is sharply drawn—her age, work-worn body, and long-term coping rituals all feel specific and lived, and her “mended deception” gives her credible moral ambiguity. Her choice to finally tell Elena the truth is well-motivated by love and guilt and lands as an earned, character-specific act. Elena’s interiority is lighter, and her resignation feels a bit tidily calibrated to invite Esther’s speech, but she still registers as a real young person under systemic pressure. The final endurance—Esther staying with the maze, Elena choosing to return to the parks—feels like an honest, small-scale renunciation rather than a pat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s inner life is specific and grounded in her mechanic’s perspective; her long-running obsession with sideways time feels well-rooted in her history and habits. Her emotions are mostly shown through embodied perception (the “mechanically warm vibration,” the icy air) rather than labels. However, the internal conflict is mild: there’s little sense of genuine risk or competing impulse in the experiment itself, so the awakening comes with limited on-page cost. The relationship with Vasquez is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens potential relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara is clearly motivated—her long tenure in the pit, sense of invisibility, and obsessive decoding give her a specific, convincing drive. Her choices (returning to the ruined house, wading into the pit, opening the panel, deciding to go public) all track cleanly with that motivation. Internal conflict is relatively muted; she rarely hesitates or doubts, so we lose an opportunity for sharper contradiction under pressure. Still, she feels particular and not generic, with the “in between spaces” worldview giving her an individual cast.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cassandra’s interior conflict—between engineered uncertainty, institutional duty, and the intolerable clarity of this vision—is sharply drawn and credibly motivates her final refusal. The “truth has mass” inheritance from her grandmother gives her flaw and vocation a specific lineage. Her choice to remain silent reads as earned stasis with real moral cost, not an easy dodge. Mira is lightly sketched yet functions well as a gentle, nonjudgmental pressure that forces Cassandra to articulate her dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s motivation (uncovering what happened to Daniela) is specific, persistent, and convincingly threaded through his history of reckless exploration and meticulous research. His interiority feels particular—“religiously skeptical” but obsessed with “swallowed truths”—and his reactions to the beads, especially the amber one, are embodied and credible. The final shift from private obsession to vowed public reckoning (“He would make them count”) is earned by what we’ve seen. There’s limited on-page contradiction under acute pressure, but for this scene’s contemplative mode, the character arc is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is specific, coherent, and vividly interiorized; her stance toward silence, decay, and witnessing feels earned and character-particular. However, she rarely experiences active internal contradiction under pressure—her commitment to witnessing is serene rather than embattled. Micro-choices (burrowing, returning to the refuge, how she chronicles) align well with her ethos but do not reveal much hierarchy of competing values. The final endurance stance is credible but carries only a muted, conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena and Maya are both sharply sketched, with clear motives and a lived-in relationship; the moment where Maya says, “you’re doing that thing again” instantly establishes dynamic and history. Elena’s core trait—careful, attentive wonder—drives her choices and culminates in relinquishing the locket, an earned, costly gesture. However, Elena borders on idealized, with little dramatized flaw or contradiction under pressure, which slightly flattens complexity. The internal conflict (clinging vs. letting go) is present but handled very gently rather than with real friction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motivation—to collect wall-stories and then to reorient that work toward finding the axis—is clear and consistent, and her perceptual gift feels integrated with her personality. Interiority is present but somewhat cool and conceptual; we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle under pressure. The realization of her “purpose” lands, but because there’s minimal on-page resistance or cost, it verges on an untested epiphany. Still, she reads as a distinct, non-generic figure with a coherent worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mei Lin is sharply etched: the abandoned spy whose meticulous, pattern-attentive mind has sublimated into fortune writing feels psychologically coherent and specific. Her motivation shift—from serving a cause to “transpos[ing] life into a new key”—credibly underlies both her present solitude and her final decision to hand over the specs. Internal contradiction (need to matter vs. desire to recede as a “harmless creator of cookie wisdom”) is present and resolved via an earned renunciation of secrecy. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of giving up the specs is more stated than embodied; we feel the idea of the sacrifice more than its visceral sting.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and using questions as both theology and weapon gives him distinctive texture. Elena’s conflict between fear and doubt is legible, though her interiority is thinner and skews toward articulated realizations rather than messier emotion. Lines like “deliberate rhetorical tools designed to plumb the depths of her doubt” and the emptiness/space reframing feel slightly expository-therapeutic under such acute pressure. Still, the final shared stance about doubt and silence reads earned by the preceding exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Li Wei’s inner life is specific and textured: the fortune-writing career, the grandmother, the nautilus, and the ache for “chronological homesickness” all cohere into a distinct psychology. Her decision to treat this as her final fortune and to redefine homesickness feels credibly earned from prior setup. The body is present (exhaustion, cold, climb) without melodrama. The only slight limitation is that her internal conflict stays relatively clean—there’s little real ugliness or misstep under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is consistent and specific, with a clear core desire—to “conquer the labyrinth of self”—and a credible shift toward accepting multiplicity. The tension between wanting a center and realizing there is none functions as an authentic internal conflict. However, her emotions skew conceptual; we get little concrete, bodily sense of fear, grief, or longing beyond the philosophical frame. The final acceptance feels earned but could land harder with a sharper sense of what she’s losing in giving up singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s characterization is rich and specific—her history as a deaf music teacher and her emotional numbness are concretely dramatized, not just labeled. Her choice to seek Elias and to submit to the drum ritual emerges logically from her fear and exhaustion. The inner shift from defended numbness to painful feeling is rapid but credibly scaffolded by memories and embodied reactions. Elias is more archetypal guide than fully individuated person, but he effectively functions as a focused external pressure on her inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and coherent: meticulous storm devotion, “credibly curious” lateral thinking, and quiet moral stubbornness all align with her reaction to the message and to being followed. Her motivation—to preserve integrity via storm records—comes through in concrete habits and in how she reevaluates her own “measurement errors.” The internal shift from resisting the “impossible” to accepting a terrifying conclusion is earned and consequential, though we get more conviction than felt inner contradiction under peak pressure. The choice to wait and be still tonight reads as a credible Earned Stasis, but a slightly sharper conflict between fear and duty in the moment could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motivation (to understand her grandmother’s reactions to scent) is clear, consistent, and carries through to the final shift in her stance toward smell. Her aromatically cautious nature is rooted in concrete childhood experience and paid off when she finally opens the vial. However, internal conflict is relatively smooth—she feels apprehension but faces little on-page resistance or contradiction at the moment of choice. The grandmother remains more symbolic than individuated, which slightly flattens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s inner life is specific (currency dissolving, objects as poems, sensing Jerome’s four stolen years) and his motive—to read time’s residue through things—is clear and consistently enacted. The woman’s brief presence adds a live relational counterpressure (“Is that an ethically playful way of avoiding the weight of it all?”) that sharpens his stance. What’s missing, at a top-tier level, is a more acute on-page contradiction or cost for Marcus personally; he never has to choose between competing values in the moment. The emotional range stays thoughtful and gently hopeful rather than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and believable, especially in how her sensitivity to sound translates into perceiving “absence” rather than generic silence. Her motivation—to break through the hush and reclaim music—emerges organically from backstory and the present moment. The internal shift from frustration to listening “between” sounds is credibly earned by her temperament and history. The only limitation is that we see relatively little contradiction or genuinely fraught choice; her change is nuanced but not strongly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s interiority is clear, specific, and grounded in the professional habits and damage of an “emotion dealer,” and the numbness/tolerance premise is convincingly embodied. Her choice to seek out the grotto and inhale the petal feels well-motivated by accumulated professional burnout and a desire to break her immunity. The transformation into “affectionate detachment” is a bit neat, with limited on-the-page contradiction or self-sabotage in the peak moment, but it’s still earned by prior setup. The chemist’s encoded compassion is a strong character-revealing touch that deepens her shift without feeling like a plot contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is clearly drawn—competent, curious, and bound by inherited obligation—and her choice to pursue the error and open the archives is well motivated. Elias feels specific in his grief and tenacity, though his role is more emblematic than pressured. Interiority is present but relatively tidy; there’s little contradiction or real strain in Marina beyond a brief sense of “cautious exuberance.” The final stance is earned but comes with minimal felt cost, which keeps the character work from reaching truly exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veren’s longing for belonging and her compulsion to shape reeds are clear, specific motivators that drive her into the search and into offering art as bridgework. Her internal recognition of Senna as a mirror of herself feels earned rather than declared. That said, we get more steady-state ache than acute, contradictory impulse under pressure; her decisions never quite come at a visible cost. Secondary characters (Kael, Senna) are sharply sketched but remain largely in service to Veren’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miriam’s motivation is clear and particular—an illustrator of extinction seeking the source of echoes—and her willingness to borrow from her own lifespan adds a credible cost. Interiority is specific (bones, shells, feathers as “interrupted cadences”) rather than generic. Internal tension between awe at the strange physics of Aldros’s nap and dread about the time-debt is present but could be pushed a bit harder in-scene. Her final exhaustion and quiet acceptance feel earned and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained: she’s driven by the inability to locate or complete her grief, and every action in the orchard flows from that. Her interiority is textured and character-particular (“reading damage like language,” quantifying Tuesdays, half-lives of hope), and the final reorientation from searching for Theo to mapping herself feels earned. The internal contradiction—needing to let go while building an elaborate system to avoid doing so—runs under the whole piece, even if it could be made a touch more enactive at peak beats. The cost of her final stance (accepting Theo’s irretrievability) is legible and rooted in the story’s prior emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren is sharply drawn through concrete habits—pipe-chase navigation, meticulous caches, the improvised tape player—and her core motive (to be “visible to those who needed her”) is credible and consistent. The sense-memory of her mother’s voice is a strong, particularizing anchor that makes her curatorial mission feel earned rather than abstract. Her decisive micro-shift—choosing to risk leaving Eleanor’s letter where it can be found—tracks cleanly from prior interior beats. The main limitation is that her fear/safety impulse doesn’t push back much against that choice, so internal contradiction under pressure is present but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s interiority is specific and consistent: her lifelong plant study, fear of losing her humanity, and creeping physical changes all converge into a credible, pressured choice to surrender. The tension between scientific dismissal and her private belief in what plants “tell” her feels lived-in rather than generic. Her final decision to allow the transformation clearly forecloses the path of medical/denial tactics with an implied cost to her former identity. The main limitation is that the struggle never gets truly ugly or self-sabotaging; her ambivalence resolves a bit too smoothly for top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is sharply drawn: her insomnia, compulsion to paint, and bone-deep exhaustion feel particular and embodied, and her choice to follow the rain and then to share her work with Theo are credible extensions of those traits. Theo is thinner but still specific enough, with the grandmother connection giving his wanderer role weight. The internal shift from punishment to witness reads earned by prior pages rather than a sudden cure. The main limitation is relatively light on-the-page contradiction or self-sabotage under pressure; her conflicts stay mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s motivation and interior life are clear and consistent, with the blindness of her clairvoyance plausibly unsettling but also oddly liberating. Her emotional arc—from reliance on foreknowledge to an earned appreciation of the present—tracks cleanly with on-page experiences. The core change feels earned, though the speed and neatness of the realization skim the edge of tidy. Some embodied reaction under peak pressure (more visceral fear or disorientation when visions crash in) could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is specific, principled, and professionally distinct; her vocation and ethics feel lived-in, and her care for the grieving reads as genuine. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or struggle—her exile and defiance are summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely see her under live pressure. The result is a strong but relatively stable portrait, with endurance rather than a visible new cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and specific—find her father and the fortress—and her internal contradiction between map-bound rationality and surrendering to the unchartable is well dramatized in micro-choices (testing the punch, following the cracks). Her emotional life is embodied through tactile engagement with objects (watch, punch, door) rather than abstractions. The father is thinly sketched but functional as a relational crucible in the final beat. The cost of her choice (giving up her mapped, ordered life) is implied more than felt on the page, which slightly blunts the change.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s sympathetic skepticism, grief, and tentative hope are well realized, especially in the shift from wanting to dismiss Aldric to surrendering to the writing. Her micro-choices (climbing the tower, agreeing to the ritual, continuing to write through tears) feel motivated and coherent. Aldric is effective but leans toward archetype—wise, gentle grief-alchemist—without much on-page contradiction or sharp edge. The final stance change (remaining a skeptic but carrying “impossible hope”) is earned, though its cost could be more acutely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motivation is clear and rooted in concrete history (boredom, Maricel, the curse) and her final choice to step through reads as earned. Her interiority is vivid but sometimes summarized in abstract language (“boredom that had calcified Vera’s soul”) rather than dramatized in conflicting impulses on the page. Secondary immortals sketch a sense of community and status but exert minimal direct pressure beyond brief reactions. The cost of leaving—abandoning the universe and accepting Maricel’s absence—is implicit but could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation is sharply drawn—the honest child of a con man trying to resolve an inherited moral ledger—and her choice to come on her own rather than as an errand-runner feels earned. The tension between her refusal to lie and her complicity in her father’s crimes is active in-scene, not just summarized. Mr. Chen’s motives (gratitude, loss, anger, waiting for Marcus to ask) are likewise clear and specific. The only thing keeping this out of the very top band is that Maya’s internal conflict at the handoff moment could register with a bit more contradictory pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mei’s obsession and ritual are clear, specific, and consistent, and her professional inheritance gives her a grounded context. However, she moves through the piece with little visible internal contradiction or moment of genuine doubt; her desire is strong but largely unopposed. Emotions are mostly implied through tactile and sensory focus rather than explicit internal conflict, which suits the mode but limits depth. The endurance of her practice at the end reads as a quiet, credible stasis rather than a hard-earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is specific and coherent: her relationship to documents vs memories, the label in her pocket, and her learned attunement to the tides all feel particular rather than generic. Motivation is clear (recovering her erased life and her husband’s) and drives her tactics. Internal contradiction is quieter—she’s largely steadfast rather than actively torn—which keeps this just shy of the most complex character work. The final decision to confront the doctor is well-prepared by prior beats and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is rich, specific, and credibly conflicted—the myth buster who craves control yet is starving for wonder lands strongly in moments like “If I could debunk it, I wouldn't have to feel small.” Her micro-choices (climbing the observatory, choosing to bow again without looking for proof, deciding to return with both recorder and “ephemeral compass”) all track cleanly with her motives. The shift from defensive rationalization to a more vulnerable listening stance feels earned and carries emotional cost. Slightly more embodied, less-articulated language around her self-knowledge in the peak beats could push this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira is clear, particular, and grounded in her role, history, and tensions between factions; the stone chip and her work as “bridge” give her a strong, specific identity. Her dual allegiance conflict is articulated and felt (“belonged to everyone and no one”), and she takes motivated actions (mediating, strategizing, adding her own symbol, going to the elders). However, we mostly see her competence and weary resolve; under elite standards, I’d want one sharper moment where her divided loyalties cause her to hesitate or visibly misstep on the page rather than only in summary. Secondary characters (Tomás, Elena, the investors) serve more as functions than as full relationship crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motive—witnessing and preserving the last true darkness—is clear, specific, and tied to her history with her father and the observatory. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular (“purposefully curious about endings,” inheriting a single grain of sand) rather than generic. The emotional progression from professional task to intimate vigil is convincing, though genuine internal contradiction under pressure is muted; she never seriously wavers or risks a different choice. The final stance—accepting “it would have to be enough”—feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is sharply drawn as a competent, sensory-attuned artisan with a distinctive worldview and work ethic. Her motivation—to “decode feedback into direction” and resurrect broken things—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices. However, she faces little internal contradiction or emotional friction; she never doubts, resents, or struggles, which keeps her arc largely static. The lack of visible personal cost or moral tension at the climax holds this below top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren is sharply drawn: a hyper-competent, dry, slightly obsessive cartographer whose need for geographical truth clearly compensates for relational failures (“Why competence had never been enough to make her lovable”). Her motivation is specific and consistent: to correct the Selenga’s headwaters as a way to grasp something origins-based when human origins have failed her. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (the condensation, the phrasebook nuance, the way she reads “scars” in geography). The main limitation is that her internal conflict is more summarized than directly pressured on the page; we see the cost, but we never see her truly waver.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bell tuner is vivid as a mythic functionary—her patience, silence, and craft cohere, and her refusal to prevent the collapse feels motivated by her commitment to balance. However, interior conflict is almost entirely absent; we never see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure, which keeps her from feeling fully human rather than archetypal. The townsfolk are deliberately spectral, but that choice reduces relational pressure and the chance to reveal her through interaction. The generational handoff at the end is elegant but emotionally underdeveloped because we know so little of either the elder or granddaughter beyond their roles.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motives (proof vs. reverence vs. survival) are clear and consistent, and the dead diver works as a silent foil that sharpens her dilemma. Her interiority is concrete and particular (“funding had run dry,” “what the surface world would forget”), and her final choice to release the memories instead of exploiting them is credibly earned. The line “By overriding instinct—the same instinct that had frozen the dead man beside her—she began to work” gestures at rich internal conflict but could linger more in that struggle instead of summarizing it. Still, for this length, her arc from extractor to witness feels psychologically grounded and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s motives (clear his father’s name, expose the warden, confront the hush-thing) are clear and consistent, and his lineage-based shame is well dramatized. Interiority is specific—his fixation on inherited reputation and on his father’s words feels character-particular, not generic. The key internal turn (“the wolf was never the point”) is mostly earned by prior reflection and the fairy-tale frame, though it edges toward thesis-statement neatness. The final stance—choosing to “cry wolf” again with proof—reads as a credible, costly evolution of his starting position.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias and Maren both feel specific and textured, with evocative embodied emotion (“mournful elation…grief and joy braided together”) and a clear, consistent sense of duty and longing. However, Elias’s motivation is almost frictionless; he rarely hesitates or entertains contradictory impulses about repaying the debt, which slightly flattens his arc. The relationship dynamic—her as both guardian and bound sacrifice—carries nuance and cost, especially in their final physical contact. The final choice to press the bead feels earned but not deeply contested, limiting the depth of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meren’s motivation is clear, coherent, and particular—her revulsion at inherited cruelty and desire to “carve a path from ruin to reverence” drive every choice. Her history (grandmother’s nets, mother’s shrouds) gives her a lived, specific place in a line of women. However, her inner conflict about defying that lineage is largely summarized rather than dramatized in the present action, so the risk feels more conceptual than embodied. The sleepwalkers function effectively as a pressure of responsibility, but never push back in a way that complicates her emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s skepticism vs inherited devotion is sharply drawn and motivates every major choice, especially the turn from “disprove” to “restore.” Her interiority is concrete and embodied (“breath caught…not from fear, but from a warmly curious wonder”), with actions (letting her feet choose the path, rebuilding the gnomon) aligned to that tension. The generational backstory (mother, great-great-grandmother) deepens her arc without feeling like generic lore. The one soft spot is that her final stance comes a bit cleanly articulated, bordering on tidy insight rather than showing more visible lingering doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera is sharply sketched through vocation, ritual, and aesthetic preferences, and her non-political creed (“to discover meaning in the margins”) is specific and credible. However, she never encounters a real dilemma or contradictory impulse on the page; all her choices align smoothly with her role. The woman she’s helping remains abstract, which limits relational or ethical friction. The ending reflects endurance of a stance rather than a pressured change, so the cost of her devotion stays largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and compelling: her cultivated foolishness, sharp observational intelligence, and craft-based espionage all feel coherent and motivated, and her decision to act in spite of the risk follows cleanly from what we’ve seen. Status dynamics with Voss and the officers are legible and effective in a small space. The main limitation is that her internal conflict remains mostly implicit—her fear, doubt, or moral hesitation are underplayed, making her feel slightly too composed given the stakes. A touch more friction between her role as “fool” and the danger of intervening would deepen the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Celeste’s motivations are sharply etched: her professional competence as a medium clashes with her terror of addressing her own dead, and that contradiction drives every beat. The fear of becoming her mother and of nullifying the fire’s importance is specific and embodied, not generic guilt. The final choice to speak feels earned by her earlier avoidance and the boatman’s “unsent letters” warning. If anything, the interior conflict resolves a bit cleanly for twenty years of silence, with little on-page backsliding or self-sabotage in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina is sharply etched: her history as a translator, the shrapnel, the coral, and her fear of mis-remembering create a coherent, specific inner life. The micro-choices—inviting the girl over, softening “the boats are coming,” deciding she might throw the coral back—arise naturally from that history. Her internal contradiction (bridge vs. blade, remembering vs. misremembering) is active on the page rather than summarized. The girl is also cleanly characterized in little space, though her interior conflict is less developed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation—recovering lost artistic joy from a spiritually corrosive commercial career—is clear and specific, and her choices (coming to the fog, using the fragment, submitting to the daydream) all express that drive. Interiority is concrete and mostly embodied (“made Mira’s chest ache,” the laugh that surprises her) rather than abstract. However, her realization about joy arrives a bit neatly, with limited dramatized resistance or contradictory impulse on the page in the present moment. The change feels earned but somewhat smoothed, with relatively low visible cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margot’s interior life is specific and coherent—her restorer’s mindset, relationship to her grandfather’s coin, and gradual shift from expert-fixer to participant all feel earned. Her key micro-choice—to ask a genuine question instead of applying another technical solution—tracks cleanly with her established traits. The change from “restorer” to “restored” is conceptually strong and credible. The piece stays mostly on one axis of conflict (certainty vs curiosity), so her contradictions under pressure could be shaded with a bit more friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus and Sofia are sharply sketched with clear roles—his charm and defiance, her grounded practicality—but their inner conflicts remain relatively low-friction; both accept the plan quickly with little dramatized ambivalence. Motivation is strong (resisting thought taxation and honoring Voss), and Marcus’s mix of scholar and rogue shows through action and dialogue. The relationship dynamic is engaging but not deeply tested under pressure. The final choice to begin teaching the alphabet is motivated and credible, but the felt personal cost of that choice is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minerva’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally coherent: her insomnia, grief, shy persistence, and transmutative impulse all manifest in concrete practices (bioluminescent poetry, off-key lullabies, mentoring refugees). Motivation is clear and continuous—she must turn pain into something nourishing—and the “shyly unstoppable” quality reads through behavior rather than label alone. Internal conflict (grief vs. duty to nurture) is present but stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in a sharp in-scene dilemma, which slightly softens impact. The final endurance choice—continuing to sing and write—is earned but not sharply re-costed in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent, and her occupation shapes her perceptions in grounded ways (“gently systematic precision,” the ritual handling of objects). Her grief and longing are well embodied in concrete sensations (the taste of the daughter’s extinct name, the tears at the end). Internal contradiction is quieter—regret versus a fragile, almost unwelcome hope—rather than dramatized as a sharp conflict in the moment. The final endurance choice (to keep tending orchids, coexisting with foxglove regret) feels earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Both siblings feel specific and flawed: Maren’s mix of intellectual idealism and cowardice, Elias’s preference for distance over forgiveness, and their mirrored self-blame are sharply drawn. Their confessions are emotionally plausible and rooted in prior behavior, not sudden revelations. The “cowardice dressed as righteousness” line edges toward diagnostic neatness but is still grounded in scene and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives are clear, specific, and organically tied to her profession as a “floodgate machinist” who lives in negotiated balances, which makes her final choice to delay revelation feel earned. Her interiority is textured with concrete actions (handling the chain, doing the analysis) rather than abstract labels. The moral conflict—honoring truth vs. protecting the villages and her grandmother’s chosen silence—is credible, though it resolves a bit neatly, with relatively little mess or self-contradiction on the page. A touch more irrationality or flaw under pressure would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivations—erasing a compromised past, then cautiously reclaiming it—are specific and consistently dramatized, and her shift from lying by reflex to voluntary disclosure and journaling feels earned. The courier-pigeon past, her ritual with the skylight, and her reaction to the meteorite all reveal a coherent, wounded but observant psyche. The relationship with Mira functions as a genuine crucible: Mira’s nonjudgmental listening and request to “show me” directly provoke Elara’s key choices. The only limit is that her internal conflict at the moment of confession is glimpsed more than fully pressure-tested on the page; a bit more embodied hesitation would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Wren’s interiority is specific and textured—her relationship to wood grain, thresholds, and “necessary distances” feels character-particular rather than generic, and her final choice to step through reads as earned from these obsessions. Motivation is clear and coherent: to understand sacred thresholds and to stop drifting, rooted in the childhood loss. Internal contradiction (longing to be found vs. acceptance of exile as lesson) is present but could be sharpened into more on-page tension. The father is only glimpsed, but his brief re-entry at the end is motivated enough not to feel arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s motives and emotional history are clear and particular—fleeing the performative world of conferences for a quieter, more legible form of attention—and her reactions to the facility and Theo feel character-specific. The moment where “her isolation suddenly feeling less like exile and more like pilgrimage” nicely crystallizes an internal shift. However, we get relatively little true contradiction or friction in her interiority once she reaches the facility; the journey is mostly smooth wonder rather than pressured choice. Theo is sketched efficiently but remains more an enabling presence than a fully pressuring counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira is sharply etched: “cheerful gloom,” professional obsession, and sister-grief all cohere into specific, felt motivation. Her micro-choices—trusting coincidence, layering the bird’s path over her sister’s, planting the seeds—arise credibly from that interior. The final acceptance of not-finding is earned by the prior emotional work, though the epiphany borders on tidy. Overall, she reads as a singular, complex person rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s analytical, orchestrating nature is vivid and consistent, and her motivation to engineer moments of wonder is clear and specific. The small internal tension between control and randomness surfaces nicely when the child disrupts her carefully planned performance. However, her inner life remains relatively untroubled—there’s little true cost or contradiction driving hard choices—so the arc feels more like confirmation than transformation. Strong, but not yet psychologically deep enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selene and Kira are sharply sketched with clear, coherent motives—Selene’s protective rigor and Kira’s hunger for irrevocable change feel grounded in the ban. The embodied cost of Kira’s choice (trembling, burning script) lands well, and Selene’s elective exile gives her stance weight. What’s missing at this level is richer contradiction or hesitation in Kira at the peak; she never truly wavers, so internal conflict remains comparatively simple. A bit more visible ambivalence or conflicting impulse in either character during the inscribing could elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s vocation, worldview, and motives are clear and particular, with strong occupational texture (glass, light, salvage) shaping how she thinks. Her emotional stance toward the demolition is more accepting than conflicted, so internal pressure remains relatively low-key. The choice to cast the stone, read the patterns, and then decide to “begin again” is motivated and credible, but the cost of that decision is muted. A touch more contradiction or messiness in her feelings about losing the atrium would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s grief, guilt, and survivor’s reflexes are specific and consistent, and his reluctance to scatter the ashes is credibly rooted in a long history of watching things burn. The internal conflict between wanting to keep her and needing to honor her wish is clear on the rock, and the turn via the memory of her painting the box feels earned rather than convenient. Emotions are largely embodied (burn scars, climbing, handling the box) rather than labeled. A few abstract formulations (“That was the curse of survival”) skate close to essayistic generality, slightly diluting the immediacy of his contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s mix of rigorous physicist and desperate mother is specific and convincing, and her methodical bead experiments under grief feel character-true. The “logical dreamer” contradiction is embodied in how she uses an impossible grotto as a data source rather than a miracle. Internal conflict (terror vs. disciplined observation) is present but somewhat smoothed; she moves toward Geneva with little felt hesitation on the page. The final stance—choosing uncertain action over paralysis—feels earned but could register a sharper emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation and private obsession are clearly rooted in backstory and family lore, and her emotional response to Helena’s work feels particular and earned. However, her interiority stays largely aligned—curiosity and reverence—without much contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicating her choices. The “burden” she assumes reads more as graceful acceptance than fraught conflict, which softens the character turn. A touch more ambivalence or cost on the page would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mirage painter has a clear, specific motivation (persuading mirrors; honoring the old woman’s last wish) and a coherent internal logic. However, she experiences almost no on-page internal conflict or contradiction—her calm mastery is never strained or tested. The “borrowed heartbeats” detail adds moral texture but doesn’t force a visible choice in this scene. As a result, she reads more as an elegant archetype than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply etched: long-service fatigue, meticulous ritualism, and stubborn hope all register through specific habits (the clipboard as armor, counting heartbeats) and choices (admitting uncertainty, committing to more work). Her internal contradiction—exhausted yet still investing in a fragile peace—is credible and carries to the final beat. Theron and Kell are sketched more minimally, but their brief exchange of losses and stiff handshake effectively reveal status, grief, and a tentative shift. A slight tendency toward thematic declaration (“The price of redemption...”) edges close to didactic, but still feels rooted in her lived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor is sharply drawn as a ruthless utilitarian with a buried sentimental core, and her history (the manufactured drought, poisoned aquifers) coheres with her present choice on the salt flat. The tension between “amoral philanthropist” and the woman kneeling in the rain is credible and specific rather than generic. The internal contradiction—seeing herself as villain while performing an intimate, pointless act of care—is well staged in the closing beats. A slightly sharper moment of real temptation to keep the egg or walk away could deepen the on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Meridia’s motivation—refusing an arranged marriage, choosing chastity as “architecture” rather than weakness—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. Her lineage-based drive to unlock the sanctuary is well seeded and fulfilled. However, internal conflict is muted; she never seriously wavers or fractures under pressure, so the arc lands more as fulfillment than hard-won change. The inheritance at the end feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus and Vera feel specific and lived-in, with clear, conflicting values around truth, beauty, and manipulation that drive their choices. Marcus’s shift from corporate calligraphy to subversive puppetry, and his willingness to admit “You weren’t entirely wrong,” gives him credible contradiction and growth. Vera’s skepticism, request to “Show me,” and quiet emotional response give her agency and interior complexity despite less page-time. The reconciliation at the end is a touch neat but earned by the on-page exchange rather than granted for free.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s motivation is precise and particular—honoring overlooked histories via her grandmother’s dismissed work—and every on-page choice (climbing, using the moth wing, dismantling the structures) aligns with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“truth wore strange clothes,” the duty to witness rather than save). The quiet endurance at the end—accepting extinction while continuing her work elsewhere—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. The only small limitation is that her internal contradictions (duty vs personal grief, faith vs scientific despair) are implied more than fully dramatized in the moment-to-moment beats.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elin’s vocation, guilt, and tenderness are sharply drawn, and her micro-choices with the rope and the card clearly arise from who she is and what she wants. The link between lost-wax casting and her relationship to memory gives her interiority a specific texture. Her shift—from clinging to artifacts to accepting herself as the vessel—is earned by prior setup. The only ceiling is that internal contradiction and visible cost under pressure (e.g., a moment of real risk or near-failure) could be pushed further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and compelling: a woman haunted by unrealized timelines whose seven-year obsession is clearly motivated and paid off in this bunker. The embodied moments (tracing Latin letters, trembling with the seal, syncing breath to the storm) root her in the world. Her turn from seeking control/answers to “walking with” the paths is earned conceptually, but the decision beat is a touch too smooth—temptation by concrete alternate lives is named rather than truly dramatized in-scene. That slight under-dramatization of conflicting impulses keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is strong: her frugality, rationalism, and quasi-religious yearning through mathematics are specific and consistent, and details like buying the notebooks “for a fraction of their worth” reveal her. The inner contradiction—skeptic building an altar of equations—is clear and thematically alive. However, her emotional experience during the discovery mostly stays in a cool, essayistic register (“Mira's hands trembled” is the main embodied spike), so the cost and strain of her obsession feel relatively muted. The endurance choice at the end (quiet obscurity and a 17-year wait) is credible but not fully dramatized as a painful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mireva and Thorne are cleanly sketched with distinct drives—her strategic pacifism and his bone-deep resentment—plus embodied emotion (fists as “second skeleton,” silent scream, tears). Thorne’s internal shift is motivated via ancestral memories and the music box, and his unclenching fists give a concrete behavioral turn. However, his resistance never fully complicates into a hard, contradictory pull; once the memory sequence begins, his change feels relatively untroubled and swift. A touch more dramatized hesitation or relapse would deepen the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and professional identity are clear and specific, and her seventeen-year obsession reads credibly through her actions and perceptions. The strongest beat is the final choice to breathe against the fog and not step through, which feels earned by the prior craft-focused patience. Internal contradiction—wanting to “capture” the dream yet ultimately deciding it should be “joined”—is present but could be dramatized earlier instead of mostly emerging in the last paragraph. Embodied emotion is more atmospheric than visceral; we see her obsession in ritual and thought more than in felt bodily strain.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira and Petra both feel vivid and particular: the quartz eye, the feistiness, the generational grief all land cleanly. Motivation is clear—Mira’s fear of her craft dying and Petra’s hunger to learn—and actions align tightly with those drives. Internal contradiction (attachment to the past vs. need to let go and teach forward) is present but could be stressed more sharply under real pressure. The relationship dynamic is strong and specific, with status and affection nicely interwoven in the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and consistent—her bewilderment, curiosity, and sense of duty are all clearly rooted in the inheritance and her history with her grandmother. Her key choices (entering the bathroom, asking the question, accepting the curator role, beginning to carve) are motivated and coherent. However, the emotional transition from baffled heir to accepting, quasi-eternal curator feels a little too frictionless; contradictory impulses (terror vs. duty, desire vs. resentment) are hinted at but not deeply dramatized. The cost of her acceptance could be felt more in her body and psyche on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s goal and methods are clear, and the time traveler’s weariness and Thessaly’s altered state sketch a credible triangle of motives. The notion of an “arcane linguist” trained in gaps is specific and dramatized through her choice to speak the mountain’s own idiom. Internal conflict is underplayed—Mira rarely doubts or wavers—which softens the felt cost of her final choice. Relationships shift (especially with the mountain) but the emotional texture of those shifts could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motive (find the sister/name) is clear and consistent, and her emotional texture—uncertainty about her own memories, the pull between longing and fear of what she’ll uncover—feels grounded. The relationship beat with the sister at the carousel is strong, with a credible tension between her urge to remember and the sister’s investment in forgetting. Internal conflict could be sharpened earlier and rendered in more embodied, less abstract terms to fully earn the late resolve (“I’ll tell our story until you believe it again”). The sister remains more emblematic than fully individuated, which slightly softens the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply sketched—adaptable, warm, and methodical—and her archivist habits plausibly drive her choices (examining the door, decoding the seal, patiently rebraiding the cord). However, she encounters little genuine resistance, and almost no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc feels more like competent execution than pressured change. The final shift toward "patience required for presence" is conceptually nice but emotionally low-cost. This keeps characterization strong but shy of the most demanding literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera is sharply characterized through vocation, body marks, and tactile habits, with a clear motive (seeking silence) that coherently drives every choice. Her acceptance of the beings as “vast and indifferent and beautiful” while still needing refuge gives her a subtle internal contradiction without over-explaining. Emotional states are mostly embodied in action and perception rather than label-speak. The main limitation is that her internal conflict never quite sharpens into a hard trade-off on the page, so the final stance feels more serene than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s role, curse, and longing for meaning are clearly established, and her shift from avoidance of artifacts to deliberate engagement with the prism feels motivated and coherent. Her emotions are often embodied (“felt the frequency in her teeth, her fingertips”), which grounds the interiority. However, internal conflict is relatively low-friction: once she understands the alignment, she pivots quickly to action with little on-page ambivalence or cost. The piece would benefit from one sharper moment where duty to the beacon and hunger for insight genuinely pull her in opposite directions.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s vocation, intellectual courage, and hunger to “sculpt identity from experience” are vivid and consistent, and her final decision to upend received history feels earned. The internal shift from faith in certainty to embracing conjecture and chosen identity is clear, though her fears of social or personal loss could be embodied more concretely. Her emotional life is largely conceptual rather than messily contradictory in the moment of choice. A bit more friction—genuine hesitation or self-deception—would deepen her beyond the archetypal thoughtful rebel.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s grief, professional identity, and need to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” are clear and consistently motivating, with good embodiment in the knot, the chants, and her reactions to the fortress. Her internal contradiction—fear of stillness vs compulsion to create—is credible though only lightly dramatized under peak pressure. The grandmother is effective but skews archetypal mentor, applying pressure mostly through affirmation rather than real friction. The closing choice to keep walking with the singed knot reads earned and rooted in prior traits, though the cost remains largely internal and understated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira is sharply drawn: her fixation on documenting transitions at the expense of living them is a specific, believable flaw that directly causes her absence and her present regret. Elena’s hurt and guardedness are clear, and her small softening—touching the cicada, asking to be taught—reads as an earned, partial shift rather than a tidy reconciliation. The line “I had confused studying transitions with living through them” articulates the core contradiction with clarity, if a touch explicitly. Emotional embodiment could be marginally richer on Elena’s side, but the relationship dynamic is strong and nuanced for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s history, coping mechanisms, and present desire are clearly and coherently motivated, with the bunker trauma credibly shadowing her reactions to the open sky and gravity inversion. The internal contradiction—body panic vs chosen pursuit of new silences—is present and specific rather than generic. Her final stance (“not yet” on the bunker silence, but “tomorrow, she would climb higher”) feels earned by prior beats. The only shortfall is the absence of a truly costly, externally pressured choice that would push the arc into deeper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eris’s grief and vocation are tightly fused; her expertise with cables, sound, and storms is plausibly rooted in seventeen years of work and a daughter lost to an early storm. Her motivation “to teach silence how to comfort” is specific and carried through to the final act of opening the vial. Internal contradiction (clinging to Mira’s relic vs. sacrificing it) is present but could be sharpened on the page at the moment of dissolution. Emotional response remains mostly controlled and professional, which fits her but slightly mutes peak-cost embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Meridia’s motivation is clear, grounded in her history as a lore keeper and a sense of civic duty, and her final choice to climb feels causally earned from that groundwork. The internal conflict—keeper of stories versus potential ruler—is present but relatively lightly dramatized, with more stated conviction than embodied ambivalence or fear. Her emotions are mostly filtered through intellectual reflection rather than specific bodily or sensory reactions under pressure. Still, her age, patience, and methodical approach come through as particularized traits rather than stock “chosen one” coding.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions (the need for radical solitude versus the compulsion to answer Sera’s pain) are clear and dramatized in concrete choices, especially in her decision to lift the doorknocker. Sera is somewhat thinner but still specific enough—her suffocation, scars, and plea give her credible urgency. The relationship is the crucible: Mira’s rules (“build thresholds, not bridges”) are tested and bent by Sera’s arrival. The only thing keeping this below top-tier is that Mira’s internal struggle resolves relatively quickly, with limited on-page ambivalence at the decision peak.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s history with the pyramid scheme, her father, and the bolt gives her a concrete, particular psychology under pressure, and her decision to volunteer feels well-motivated by her practiced relationship with transformation. Interiority is character-specific (patterns in chaos; “a woman who grew light in darkness”) rather than generic. The main limitation is that her inner conflict at the climactic choice is a bit too smooth—there’s little messy ambivalence or risk of refusal on the page, which slightly softens the cost of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaret’s interiority is specific and motivated—her need to understand the dynasty’s collapse and her reverence for her grandmother come through clearly, and her micro-choices with the gramophone and book track that motivation. The grandmother’s character, rendered through backstory, feels vivid and morally complex despite being off-page. The main weakness is limited on-page internal contradiction: Margaret moves rather smoothly from curiosity to acceptance, with little felt resistance or self-protective denial. The final decision to “begin” feels earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aldric’s doubt, weariness, and latent openness are rendered with specificity, and his choice to shed his armor and accept connection feels organically motivated. The interior conflict between Order-oaths and older, softer allegiances is embedded in details like his grandmother’s patterns. The main weakness is that his shift from doubt to near-ecstatic acceptance happens very smoothly, with limited on-page resistance or cost explored at the peak. A touch more friction or visible fear as he surrenders his identity as a knight would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eleanor is sharply rendered: her broken engagement, meticulous work, and emotional restraint create a coherent, specific psyche. Her motivation—to preserve quiet acts of care as compensation for her own abandonment—feels earned and consistent. The internal turn around Thomas’s promise is believable and layered, though a few lines (“She would never stop being broken-hearted”) skate close to authorial labeling instead of letting behavior fully show it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s core motive (preserving true history) is clear and coherently expressed through her choices, and her “underestimated” façade is well set up and paid off. However, her interior conflict is relatively thin: fear, doubt, or moral tension under pressure are largely summarized rather than embodied. She remains highly competent with little visible emotional degradation under stress, which flattens complexity. The ending stance (“She would keep fighting”) feels earned but low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s long-term obsession and inherited burden are clear, specific, and emotionally grounded, and her final release feels earned by decades of practice and sacrifice. Interiority is textured and embodied (“felt the prophecy take root in her mind”), with believable contradictions between duty, grief, and relief. The choice not to have children is a strong, visible cost that deepens her characterization. The only limitation is that we never see her truly tempted to speak the words in-scene, which would have sharpened internal conflict at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Wren’s worldview and long history of sorting gives her a distinct, grounded interiority, and her motivation—to find meaning and messages in the leaves so her life is not “just sorting”—is clear and specific. The turn from belief in prophecy to understanding encoded transformation is motivated by her decades of observation and reverent practice. However, the internal conflict is relatively soft; she does not visibly struggle or resist the shift so much as accept it, which slightly flattens complexity. The transformation feels emotionally honest but a bit tidy, with limited sense of cost beyond losing her prior framework.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply etched: a lifelong fixer of clocks confronting the hollowness of her obsession, with concrete history and profession grounding her worldview. Her shift—from enforcing precision to “befriending uncertainty”—is motivated by the admiral’s logbook and the honest compass, and her small behavioral choices (digging, deciding to build a probabilistic clock, not counting the hours back) align with that. The main limitation is that her internal conflict resolves quite smoothly; we rarely see serious resistance or emotional messiness as she relinquishes a defining life-identity, so the cost stays largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives and history are clear and specific, and her mix of scientific rigor and mystical openness gives her a distinct inner life. The emotional throughline from shame to a reframed sense of legacy is well earned. However, her internal conflict is relatively tidy and linear—she moves toward insight without much on-page contradiction or backsliding under pressure, which softens the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and embodied—“modestly fearless” is dramatized in her willingness to descend despite apprehension, and her numbness around her own name and purpose feels earned by centuries of work. The spirits’ confessions reframe her past actions plausibly rather than inventing a new trait, so the realization that she’s always been a healer lands as revelation rather than retcon. The contradiction between feeling lost and having quietly sustained others is well handled, though the late “She was a healer. She had always been.” edges toward tag-line neatness. The emotional cost—an ache that remains even as it glows—is credibly maintained at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and particular—her actuary background, proprioceptive enhancement, and torture history all cohere into a distinctive way of feeling and thinking. Motivation (to decode and then rewrite the “mathematics of mercy”) is clear and drives her on-page choices, especially the decision to stay in the forest and bury the mask. However, internal conflict is relatively mild; the piece leans toward a unified resolve rather than showing sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation/commitment is earned but could carry more visible emotional self-contradiction for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation (to continue her grandmother’s work and honor overlooked histories) is clear and consistent, and her micro-hesitation before taking the fragment gives a real, if brief, internal conflict. Her interiority is concrete and particular (the unnamed pull, the way she “translates” images), not generic. The main limitation is that her flaws or blind spots are only lightly sketched; the choice feels weighty but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Miriam is sharply sketched: a pragmatic technician whose history with ghosts and instinct to “look up” feel specific and grounded, and her competence is credible. Her choice to engage with the ringmaster’s request rather than stay professionally detached is a clear, motivated turn. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s more steady than conflicted—so the emotional cost of her final choice stays relatively quiet. The ghost himself is vivid but functions mostly as a catalyst rather than a deep relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motivations are clear and consistent—her weariness with perfection and desire to catalyze “rupture” feel organic and drive her choice to pull the lever. Her interiority is specific (“books…needed to be rewritten, argued with, stained with coffee and tears”) rather than generic. What’s missing at an elite level is sharper internal contradiction or visible emotional cost in the climactic choice; she never really wavers. The result is a strong but not deeply conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s characterization as a spent revolutionary turned archaeologist-poet is specific and coherent, and her superstition about mirrors nicely embodies her trauma and fear. Her decision to step through the mirror is well-motivated by her desire to “understand” and her gradually crystallizing theory about the Verantis-7 civilization. There is some internal tension between caution and longing for purpose, though the conflict could be sharpened with one more concrete moment of hesitation under pressure. Overall, she feels like an individual rather than an archetype, with actions that align with her established motives.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply defined through his craft, his sensitivity to mechanisms, and his almost priestly relationship to broken things. The internal conflict—wanting his grandmother back versus accepting the stone’s true purpose—lands cleanly in the “wilting” beat. His realization is a bit tidy, but it grows credibly from his lifelong habits of listening and repair. The final renunciation (letting the light go forward rather than clinging to it) feels earned with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivations (pursuit of the Threshold, attraction to the compass, valuing silence over the factory’s noise) are clear and consistent, and her final renunciation of “the way back” feels earned. Interiority is particular and embodied—“pull at something behind her sternum,” her careful timing of the descent—rather than generic. Internal conflict is relatively muted; we don’t see much active fear or doubt in tension with her longing, which slightly flattens the emotional complexity of the climax. Still, the final stance crystallization reads credibly as an Earned Stasis/acceptance moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivations (lost in the storm, drawn to the slide, seeking meaning in her art and inheritance) are clear and consistent, and her interiority feels specific to a driftwood sculptor rather than generic. Her final shift—from skepticism to accepting her role in the alliance and choosing to navigate by resonance instead of GPS—is earned by prior setup. However, internal contradiction is relatively soft; she doesn’t visibly wrestle between incompatible impulses so much as move along a smooth arc. The emotional cost of accepting this “weight of future connections” could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—her drive to decode her grandmother’s mystery and the “stone in her chest” work well, and the mural becomes a believable outgrowth of that drive. The grandmother is vividly evoked through artifacts and obsession rather than summary labels. However, Mira’s internal conflict remains mostly one-directional; there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond quiet longing. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-friction, more revelation than hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste’s motivation and vocation are sharply aligned—her archivist patience and ethical drive clearly explain both the decoding and the risk of traveling to the lagoon. The retrocognitive visions create a distinct inner life, though her internal conflict (being “trapped” vs. choosing to pursue the truth) could be pushed harder in the present-tense scenes. The granddaughter character is sketched efficiently and serves her function without much depth. The final stance—accepting the burden of carrying these voices—is earned but emotionally tidy rather than deeply torn.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is clear, specific, and motivated—her exile, contempt for the Academy’s reductionism, and quiet stubbornness feel earned and coherent. Her core choice (accessing memories without opening the bottle, then leaving the village to itself) aligns well with her stated beliefs. What’s missing for the highest tier is a more dramatized internal struggle or contradictory impulse in the present; she rarely feels genuinely torn. The emotional cost of seventeen years of obsession is mostly asserted rather than felt beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is specific, competent, and her vocation and strange fluency feel organically tied to her worldview. Her motivations—to archive emotional patterns and honor the “window”—are clear and consistent, and the realization that she’s a junction point is credibly seeded. What’s missing at this echelon is more on-page contradiction or cost: she doesn’t visibly struggle with fear, doubt, or refusal, and her acceptance of the new role comes too smoothly. The final transformation into “the oath itself” lands conceptually but not as a hard personal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and particular—she’s driven not just to preserve seeds but to understand the “texture of borrowed time,” and this desire credibly guides every choice. Her interiority is concrete (the oak cap, the burn of cold, the family journals) and her final acceptance of the vortex reads earned by what we’ve seen. The piece is quieter on internal contradiction—she has doubts and risk is noted, but she moves toward the inheritance with relatively little ambivalence on the page. Still, the shift from guarded approach to integrated purpose lands as a believable reconfiguration rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific, textured, and coherent—from her history with sirens to her desire to “favor listening over noise,” and that motive cleanly underwrites her acceptance of the bell-pulling role. The humility/competence balance reads credible and distinct. The main limitation is the relative lack of on-page contradictory impulses at the peak; her choice to pull the rope feels almost entirely settled rather than genuinely fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply drawn: her evolution from ambitious, noise-seeking youth to someone rooted in “flourishing stillness” feels coherent and earned. Interiority is specific (e.g., tracing meteors, feeling their journeys in her pulse) rather than generic. The main limitation is reliance on a few stock abstractions around “meaning” and “need to matter” instead of dramatizing those earlier flaws in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is distinct, with clear motives (keeping the covenant, attending to ghosts) and a consistent temperament (“tranquilly perceptive”) that informs her choices. Her interiority is mostly implied through attention and action rather than explicit thought, which suits the piece but limits visible internal contradiction. The grandmother and the young mother are efficiently sketched with specific gestures and implied histories. The ending reads as an earned endurance/renunciation—she holds the box and postpones action—though the cost is quiet rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s motivation—accepting borrowed years for understanding rather than survival—is clear, specific, and threads cleanly into her final decision to continue Elena’s work. Her interiority is textured (e.g., feeling years as sediment in the urn), but her emotional state remains relatively even and contemplative, with little contradictory impulse on the page. The shift from “borrowed” to “essential” is resonant but comes easily, without much dramatized resistance or cost. Adding one concrete moment where she hesitates or feels the risk of spending her remaining years this way would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is specific, embodied, and her philosophy clearly drives her choices: approaching the boy, mending the kite, attaching the feather, and returning to her notebook. The boy is sketched efficiently but credibly, with his attempt to hold dignity undercut by visible disappointment. The main limitation is a lack of real internal contradiction or struggle in Mira—she reads as serenely wise throughout, so her final stance feels confirmed rather than earned against resistance. For top-tier work, I would want one moment where her belief in imperfect beauty is tested rather than smoothly expressed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and specific—use her remaining time to reconcile trees and living stone—and her choices (starting with the oldest oak, shifting to teaching when she can’t climb) track cleanly from that goal. Her brazen calm in the face of terminal illness is distinctive, though her inner conflict around dying is mostly implied rather than dramatized in embodied moments. The shift from active worker to instructor is a credible, costly change of role. Secondary “characters” (foxes, ravens, bees, pillars) serve as a relational crucible in a metaphorical sense, revealing her embeddedness in a non-human community.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s skepticism, academic background, and pull toward the tower create a coherent, specific interiority, and her final decision to answer “yes” feels earned by prior reflection. Her emotional responses are mostly embodied through sensory focus and small actions (the climb, touching the amber) rather than labels. The internal conflict—skepticism vs. need for meaning—is present but could surface more as contradictory impulses in-scene rather than largely as summarized prior stance. The cost of her shift (what she gives up in terms of identity or worldview) is implied but could be made slightly more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Erasmus is vivid, particular, and consistent: an isolated coachman turned ritual gardener-linguist whose daily choices all flow from a coherent devotion to repair. His motivation—to heal the battlefield with the reef’s remains—is clear and nicely refracted through concrete actions (seed selection, language choice, ritual repetition). What’s missing for the top band is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or risk; he feels serenely resolved rather than under genuine psychological pressure. The final stance (to keep tending until blooming or death) is earned but carries limited felt cost beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s motivation is clear, rooted in a specific history with her daughter and her former work, and her decision to leave the dead for the living is earned. Her interiority is concrete and particular (“nose catching not death but life”), though moments of conflict could be pushed harder—for instance, more explicit hesitation about abandoning Crag Hollow would deepen the cost. Ven is sketched efficiently but remains largely a functionary; the relationship dynamic is gentle and static rather than a crucible. The final choice reads credible and motivated, but Marta’s contradictory impulses (fear/hope, age/fatigue vs. desire) could be more dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn: her mutation, solitude, and ritual give her a specific psychology, and her choice to finish the sketch before engaging with rescue is motivated and coherent. The backstory of rage → adaptation grounds her current calm without melodrama. However, in this final scene her contradictory impulses (hope for contact vs commitment to purpose) are more stated than deeply dramatized, so the internal conflict feels relatively low-friction. The endurance choice is earned but a touch tidy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Corwin’s motives are clear and consistent—save his master, use skills he has forsworn—and the chivalrous-thief past gives his present choice texture. His interiority feels particular (“sacredly playful reverence,” the specific theft of bottled children’s tears), and the heir reveal is emotionally grounded. The internal conflict (oath not to steal vs. need to steal) is present but lightly tested, with little sense he might truly refuse or fail. That keeps this shy of the most demanding literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s motives and contradictions are vivid and specific: a real survivor commodifying her trauma, both repulsed by and dependent on that work, then choosing to walk away. Her crisis-actor job, camp-learned foot-writing, and carved pawns all grow organically from the same psyche. The final decision to leave the drills and reframe herself as “historian of small gestures” is well earned. A small weakness is that some self-descriptions (“She had become something strange after the war”) edge toward thesis rather than fully dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s motives are clear and particular—survival under the forgetting plague, then reclaiming her buried gift and “the shape of home.” The choice to accept pain in order to speak the world’s grief is an earned evolution from earlier avoidance. However, her internal conflict tends to be summarized (“she had been too young to carry it”) rather than dramatized in simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page. A bit more in-scene struggle during the nightly attempts would deepen the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s guilt, professional pride, and compulsive need to decode patterns are rendered with concrete habits (the knight, the restless hands) and culminate in a credible inner turn. His final act—releasing the chess piece—feels motivated by the gradual reframing of his responsibility rather than a sudden epiphany. There’s some simplification of inner conflict (he moves fairly directly from guilt to acceptance), but it’s still nuanced and specific. The lack of other active characters means the relational crucible is absent, but for a single-POV piece, his arc is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sera’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently expressed—her refusal to flatten her mother into one sin grounds every choice, from gathering the poets to the way she speaks at the climax. The interiority is vivid and character-particular (“paint-stained fingers,” childhood mischief with echoes), and the contradiction between love, grief, and defiance reads credibly. The final endurance—choosing complexity over sanctioned absolution—feels earned by prior beats, though the emotional cost of defying the Elders could be shaded more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—her uncertainty, grief, and compulsion around the key ring all drive the scene’s choices. The central method (mapping wounds to pockmarks) externalizes her psychology in a character-particular way. Her final shift—from seeking certainty to accepting uncertainty as a productive crack—feels earned by the preceding beats. The only limitation is the relative absence of active relational pressure on the page; most crucible work is with memories rather than another will.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Edwin’s interiority is specific and consistent—his attachment to the quay, the seashell, and his daughter all read as lived rather than schematic, and his coping strategy (“present enough to create, distant enough to endure”) feels character-particular. His motivation to keep creating until “the colors ran out” is dramatized through concrete acts (packing the easel, taking the shell, choosing to paint the cave instead of the quay). The internal turn—realizing the quay paintings were about promise rather than nostalgia—is well earned by prior details. A slightly neater, more declarative closing articulation of his change (“He understood now why…”) nudges the arc toward tidy rather than fully messy human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vivid, with embodied history (dead shore birds, the abandoned head keeper, the grandmother’s cork) and a consistent, particular sensibility about quiet attention. Her decision to stay, to answer the call, and to guide the boy is all clearly motivated. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction—she rarely wavers or shows simultaneous opposing impulses under pressure. The boy’s characterization is poignant but a bit archetypal, serving more as emissary of grief than as a fully individuated presence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives are clear and particular—staying because she has nowhere else, driven to “navigate” loss rather than flee it—and her choices (refusing evacuation, building the array, accepting the caller’s charge) track cleanly from those motives. Her grief is embodied through specific attachments (the censer foot, her family’s charts) rather than generic sadness. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper in-scene contradiction or value clash; she rarely feels genuinely torn or self-deceived under pressure. The future-self reveal is emotionally apt but slightly tidy, resolving rather than complicating her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is specific, grounded in her rational, soil-and-mycology mindset, and her avoidance of others post-virus feels psychologically credible. The arrival of the eye forces a real dilemma—destroy/hide/use—with her choice to test a lie reading as both inevitable and costly. Her shift from isolationist self-protection to planning to share the cure is motivated by prior beats and the world’s trauma. The one slight weakness is that the final sense of “almost whole” verges on a tidy emotional resolution for such deep damage.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is specific, textured, and consistent: a long-isolated keeper whose eccentricities (naming storms, conversing with the beam, archiving “borrowed memories”) all emerge through concrete habits. His motivation to decode the logbook is rooted in this life pattern and feels inevitable. The emotional change—shifting from absolute solitude to carrying another’s memories with purpose—is clear but could register with slightly sharper internal contradiction or cost. His calm acceptance minimizes visible struggle, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s characterization is textured and consistent: a lonely, obsessively driven expert whose life has been hollowed out by her father’s promise, and whose map-focused perception shapes how she reads the world. Motivation for each step (studying the chip, undertaking the journey, risking the cavern) is clear and rooted in long-term obsession. The final choice—implied return rather than escape into alternate lives—is psychologically coherent but could use a touch more embodied, contradictory emotion in the moment of decision. The father functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than as a fully pressured relationship on the page, slightly flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The queen’s motives and contradictions are sharply etched: her need for certainty, attachment to the advisor, and repressed memory make her both competent and self-sabotaging. The oracle-queen dynamic is strong, with the older woman applying clean pressure rather than serving as a mere exposition device. The line “I was a coward” followed by the oracle’s reframing into survival lands as an earned realization, not a shortcut epiphany. A slight limitation is that we glimpse her relationship to the advisor only in summary, so the emotional cost of turning on him is powerful but could be even more textured.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn: her mix of rigorous curiosity and grief-rooted obsession feels specific, and her realization about attention vs capture is well motivated by Theo’s challenge. Theo has a clear, distinct role as both emotional stake and intellectual foil. The relationship history (seven years) comes through in subtext and small details (shared experiments, watching her work), not just exposition. The one weakness is that her final shift lands a bit cleanly, with limited messy contradiction left on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory—her mix of professional detachment, jealousy of her own other selves, and shaken awe reads as genuinely human. Motivation is clear (to make sense of the temporal chaos) and her final stance shift—from fearing the grave to writing toward it—feels earned. The “chronicler’s curse” realization nicely crystallizes her flaw. A slight tendency toward cleanly articulated self-diagnosis keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena is sharply drawn through her altered sensory world, vocational pivot, and tactile relationship to mechanisms, and Margaret’s grief is embodied in gesture more than label. Elena’s history as an aromatherapist who now “reads bodies differently” gives her interiority specificity and contradiction. The way she chooses to treat the repair as emotional witnessing as much as technical work feels motivated and consistent. A slight softness comes from some dialogue skirting the edge of thematic pronouncement rather than emerging purely from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s fear, curiosity, and stubbornness are clearly embodied—her panic-triggered frost, the deliberate choice not to fight it, and the decision to inscribe runes on her own skin all feel motivated and specific. The internal conflict between scholarly orthodoxy (mentor’s dismissal) and “folk nonsense” gives her a credible risk. Emotional experience is grounded in concrete images (scar, ice, crows) rather than labels. The only limitation is that the cost of her choice is mostly potential rather than immediately felt beyond strain and fear.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is sharply sketched—a tabloid-smeared exorcist driven by long-nursed guilt—and his desire to apologize and redeem a past failure cleanly motivates his choices. Eleanor’s presence is brief but distinct, with her continued “conducting” and fixation on the perfume bottle grounding her as more than a plot device. However, Marcus’s inner conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure, so we rarely see contradictory impulses truly collide in-scene. His competence makes the exorcism feel relatively untroubled emotionally, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness has a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct interior lens, but she remains more archetypal than individuated. Her emotional texture is mostly serene comprehension rather than conflicted, embodied feeling, which blunts the sense of cost at the end. The shift from “witness” to active synthesizer is legible and motivated, yet it lands as a smooth evolution rather than a pressured choice. A touch more contradiction or vulnerability in how she approaches the illusions would deepen her as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Einar’s vocation, long tenure, and evolving receptivity to Magnusson’s ideas make his final choice to step through feel motivated and coherent. His curiosity and unease are concrete (the upward-flowing water, off-scale humming), but internal conflict is relatively muted—there’s little on-page resistance to the irreversible step. The “shepherd” metaphor usefully personalizes his relationship to the clocks. A touch more dramatized ambivalence at the brink would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya’s grief, professional history, and spatial gift interlock into a coherent, specific interiority, and her choices in the farm (using the laser, deciding to continue the research, staying through dawn) all feel motivated by that blend. The brother-sister relationship is drawn with economical but sharp detail (“birthday texts and obligatory holiday calls”), giving their estrangement real weight. Her realization about permeability as a mode of letting go grows credibly from earlier observations. A slight safety-net is the relative lack of uglier or more contradictory impulses under peak emotion; her arc is very clean for this level of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margot’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in her history with her father; her contradiction—rigorous probabilistic mind vs. attraction to his irrational quest—feels psychologically credible. Micro-choices (starting the subway project, going to the archives, deciding to pay the debts and continue his research) align with that tension. Emotions are mostly embodied through interactions with objects (textbook, lantern, rain, clover air) rather than generic labels. The final stance—choosing to “live inside” contradiction—feels earned, though it’s articulated a bit explicitly rather than left entirely to implication.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera is sharply etched through specific, habitual behaviors (the glass disc, the timing of the calls) and a coherent vocation of “cultivated estrangement,” and her choices—to hold the caller, to redirect her grief—are motivated and consistent. The mother’s grief is credible if sketched, with strong particulars like the deleted voicemail, though her emotional texture leans toward a single register of sorrow without much contradiction on the page. Internal conflict in Vera (e.g., any cost or doubt about her chosen distance) is largely implied rather than dramatized. The quiet “earned stasis” of her remaining in the booth works, but the personal cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marguerite is clearly motivated, with a coherent history and a satisfying realization that her life's "minor" work has been sacred all along. Her emotional responses are embodied enough (tears with "haunted euphoria") and tied to specific objects (locket, letters). The main limitation is a lack of real internal contradiction or moral friction—she moves quite smoothly from confusion to acceptance, with little resistance or cost. This flattens what could be a more complex pivot when she chooses to renew the covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s characterization is specific, textured, and consistent—an itinerant logistician who hides behind competence and jokes, with a clearly motivated shift when she chooses to stop running. Her interiority ("desperately jocular," realizing she’s been running from what she craves) feels earned and tied to concrete history. Okonkwo, though less interior, has a distinct worldview and status dynamic with her. The final choice—to bind herself to reciprocity—tracks cleanly from the established flaw and longing, with a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meridia’s motivation and inner life are vivid and particular—the lifelong vocation, the grandmother’s legacy, and the commission for the dying woman all cohere into a clear hierarchy of values. The sensory interiority filtered through touch and vibration is especially strong. The final renunciation (choosing not to return to the stillpoint) is earned, though the decision reads a touch too smooth, with limited on-page struggle or genuine risk of her choosing oblivion. A bit more contradictory impulse at the threshold of neutrality would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s guilt, competence, and self-punishing impulse are cleanly motivated, and her profession-specific mind (math, signals, primes) feels particular. Her key choice—to risk “editing history” by sending a corrected message—is well grounded in years of self-reproach and Okonkwo’s influence. The internal conflict (penance vs. hope of undoing harm) is present but could surface more viscerally in the peak moment; she moves to the console with relatively little hesitation on the page. Embodied emotion is adequate but not deeply textured, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid and particular—her filmless camera, felt vibrations, and ghostlike observation give her texture—and Elena’s mix of power and exhaustion reads clearly. Motivations are well-rooted (Mira’s drive to translate silence; Elena’s to save the harbor) and their quick rapport feels emotionally plausible. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper contradiction or friction between them under pressure; they align almost immediately with little tested conflict. Mira’s “ghost” endurance at the end has cost implied, but her internal struggle between remaining invisible and stepping into influence could be more actively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Miriam’s motives (rescuing her father’s work and fulfilling his promise) are clear and consistent, and her particular way of thinking (“feel logic before she could articulate it”) gives her a distinct interiority. The arson choice nicely reveals her value hierarchy under pressure. However, most conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so contradictory impulses in the present moment remain largely implied rather than actively pulling against one another. The final shift into “now she has a new promise” feels earned but could land harder if more on-page struggle preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation (honoring Elias and resolving the haunting) is clear, consistent, and her night-time rule-breaking and drumming are credible expressions of it. Interiority is specific—“quietly rebellious,” “she called it haunting,” the felt space as he leaves—though her conflict is more linear longing than truly contradictory impulses. The final shift to “Volunteer Seventeen again” with a different loneliness is earned and paid for emotionally. A slightly deeper dramatization of her ambivalence toward the lab and the haunting itself would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Celia’s competence, sensory bias toward sound, and quiet alignment with the father’s philosophy make her feel particular and grounded, and her choice to help him is motivated and consistent. The stranger is thinner but still legible: driven, patient, emotionally contained until the end. There’s little visible internal contradiction or real cost to Celia’s decision, which keeps this a strong but not transformative character arc. The relationship dynamic is nicely understated but could use one sharper moment of friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian is sharply drawn through habit, object (the dental mirror), and her chosen method of intervention; her silence and grief feel particular rather than generic. Her motivation—to keep vigil at the site of her brother’s drowning and protect others—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is present (protective impulse vs. refusal to speak) but remains somewhat under-dramatized in the present moment. The boy is sketched effectively as an on-page pressure but not deeply individuated, which is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s characterization is specific and compelling: menopausal onset of mind-reading, long-term chess coaching, and quiet organizing history all cohere into a distinctive person with clear values. Her motivation to resist standardized testing feels fully earned through Marcus and the weeping prodigy. The main limitation is the relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or sharp ambivalence in the present scene—she’s already resolved, with little visible struggle. The final choice to proceed reads consistent but not costly in an immediate, character-crucible way.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives are clear and consistent—her lifelong pull toward the sea and the newfound chance to embrace it after the Treaty—while Jonas provides a grounded emotional counterweight. The dock-worker past, the grandmother’s bequest, and the shame around “hiding” her nature all sharpen her decision to leave. Internal contradiction is present but mild; she feels some cost in leaving Jonas yet rarely wavers, which keeps the choice from feeling fully agonized. Jonas’s guardedness-turned-vulnerability via the scrimshaw is strong, but their relationship could withstand a slightly deeper test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is sharply etched: a former performer whose theatrical narration, secret whittling, and clinging to the bouquet all line up as tactics for surviving the mandate while refusing erasure. The internal contradiction between her mandated blankness and rich interior grief is consistently embodied (e.g., the figures on the rail, "tears she couldn't shed in public"). Motivation is clear and specific—preserve grief without being destroyed by it—and her endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. The only constraint at this length is that no single on-page decision escalates risk beyond the incremental, so the arc feels deep but not quite transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mora’s motives (returning to the banned site, testing whether her words had power) are clear and consistent, and her interiority feels particular (“cloud-shadow poet,” doubt vs. certainty). The main limitation is that her internal conflict doesn’t quite sharpen into simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure—once she feels certainty, resistance largely evaporates. Her micro-choices (to paraphrase instead of copy, to read aloud) do reveal values and history credibly. The exile cost is mostly off-page, but it does inform her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and embodied—her history with colorblindness, art, and the grandmother’s instrument all feed directly into the trade. Her willingness to risk her established style for “true” sight is credibly set up and paid off. The relationship with Theo is functional but underdeveloped; he applies only modest pressure and feels more like an archetypal gatekeeper than a fully pressured character. Internal contradiction is present (desire for truth vs risk to her work) but resolved a bit too smoothly for top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to understand the “texture of connection”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, from entering the lab to structuring the listening as a pilgrimage. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sound-color synesthesia and the physicality of bell-ringing, not just labels. The change at the end (redefining bell-ringing as sending connection without expectation) feels earned by the accumulated experiences at each “station.” The main limitation is that we rarely see genuine internal push-pull or flawed impulses; the arc is contemplative rather than conflicted, which slightly flattens character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief, professional history, and withdrawal are specific and embodied (“fingers… calloused from years of twisting silver wire around locks of the dead’s hair”), and her shift from numbness to teaching-making feels motivated and earned. Her actions (choosing the observatory, folding cranes, reconfiguring her craft) clearly arise from her traits and loss. Internal contradiction—wanting timeless suspension yet choosing to re-engage—is present, though mostly articulated rather than dramatized in a tight scene. The emotional trajectory is convincing but could gain further depth from one on-page moment where her conflicting impulses collide under more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera is sharply drawn—her analytical, almost scientific approach to fortune-telling feels distinctive and consistent, and Marcus’s arc from skepticism to a small, vulnerable question is credible. The status dynamic (once-dismissive VC now supplicant) is clear and used well. However, interior contradiction under pressure is relatively light; we’re told more about Vera’s project than we’re immersed in her emotional stakes, so her obsession and any cost to it remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motives are vivid and layered—truth vs. power vs. grief—and the grandmother relationship, filtered through the veil, gives her interiority specificity rather than generic longing. The “steadily unpredictable” drive is shown as contradiction in action (wanting forbidden knowledge while upholding a suppressive order) rather than just labeled. Her choice to perform the ritual despite knowing the Netharans’ fate feels coherent with those tensions. The only limiting factor is that the piece leans slightly more on stated reflection than on in-the-moment micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s vocation, long habit of climbing to the library, and quiet, persistent motivation to protect hope create a specific, credible character whose choices feel grounded. Her decisive choice to engage the shadow and offer the river stone is well prepared by prior noticing. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper on-page contradiction or internal friction under pressure—her insight into the shadow’s nature comes with little visible struggle. The emotional cost (accepting irretrievable loss) is present but described more than dramatized in her body and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is specific and grounded in her craft—her handling of the vial and rebuilding the enclosure embody her competing impulses of self-reproach and enduring care. Motivation is clear (reconciling betrayal with her need to keep caring) and her final stance—reporting Marcus while continuing the work—is credibly earned. The piece nicely avoids therapy-speak, though a few thematic articulations (“To balance self-respect and compassion meant…”) slightly flatten what is otherwise shown with nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivations (avoid further surgery, honor/complete her mother’s work) are sharply drawn and her plant-hearing is integrated into her emotional life, not just the plot. The tension between wanting to be “fixed” and valuing her aberrant gift is implied rather than fully dramatized, which keeps her internal conflict slightly tidier than ideal. Thomas’s grief and reluctant trust add credible relational pressure but he’s mostly reactive. The final choice to flee with him feels earned and in character, with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motivation is clear, particular, and emotionally grounded in her grandmother’s history, and her psychometric process reads as a lived skill rather than a gimmick. Her internal state is embodied through tactile engagement with objects and spatial visions, though her conflict is more contemplative than sharply contradictory. The key choice—releasing rather than reclaiming the stored love—is credibly earned by what she learns in the reading. The main limitation is the relative softness of on-page ambivalence or visible cost at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to return stolen creativity—is clear, consistent, and rooted in her sensitivity to unspoken words, and her micro-choices (climbing, investigating the device, choosing to release it) all align. Interiority is vivid and particular (“her eyes held too much sky”), but her internal conflict at the peak is quite mild: she hesitates only briefly before turning the dial. The cost to her is more implied than dramatized (exhaustion, lifelong burden finally eased), so her arc feels emotionally satisfying but not fully pressure-tested. Overall she reads as a specific, coherent character, but under less genuine strain than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, history with her grandmother, and guiding motive (“to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”) feel specific and consistent, and her key choice—helping the child at a cost to the dune—reads as earned. However, her interiority skews declarative and calm; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. The child functions more as an idea than a fully realized person, limiting relational friction. The final realization about hope is believable but emotionally smooth, with little visible struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and credible: the ache of displacement, her history as an academic, and the refusal of suppressants all align into a clear, character-rooted motivation. Her conflicting impulses—fear of unraveling vs attraction to “probable miracles”—are dramatized rather than merely stated. The choice to risk her talisman on the tree is an earned, character-specific act that signals a real shift from theorist to practitioner. The only limiting factor is that the emotional cost of surrendering that last piece of her old life is underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is clear and emotionally specific, especially in the recalled moments of silence and avoidance, and her central shift—from seeing herself as a coward to someone reclaiming stored courage—is motivated and legible. The guides are archetypal but consistent, with their gentleness and patience shaping how pressure is applied. Internal contradiction (yearning for freedom yet feeling lost) is present but could be deepened with more idiosyncratic, Mira-specific detail. The final choice to reclaim courage and walk on feels earned, though the cost is framed softly rather than as a sharp internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and particular, especially the synesthetic nerve regeneration and her conflicted reverence/resentment toward her grandmother’s sacrifice. Her final choice to turn the bolt feels motivated by accumulated doubt about “remaining” and the bellhop’s risky prompts. The bellhop is sketched efficiently but still reads as an active moral agent. A slightly sharper articulation of Mira’s selfish fears (what she personally stands to lose) under the ethical calculus could deepen the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is vivid and particular—her diminutive titanhood, patience, and reverence for records feel specific and coherent, and her motivation to safeguard legitimate sovereignty is clear. However, she encounters little real resistance, so we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine strain under pressure. Her decision to act via truth rather than force fits her nature but demands relatively little of her, softening the sense of cost. The result is strong characterization with underexploited depth and conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina is sharply rendered through embodied habits (the finger-tapping, the way she works with data) and an 11-year history that feels lived-in, with the grandmother relationship adding moral and emotional complexity. Her realization that she has misread the reefs’ suffering is both intellectually and emotionally grounded, and the choice to transmit the coordinates is fully motivated. There is some internal contradiction—professional rigor vs. filial grief and guilt—but it stays mostly in implication rather than being dramatized in a single high-friction moment, which slightly limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation—to keep the meaning of the rebellion alive—is clear and consistent, and her barefoot ritual, use of the opera glasses, and attraction to the stones all reveal a specific, embodied interiority. Her shift from private, contemplative waiting to a commitment to re-engage with comrades reads as earned by what the stones reveal. However, internal conflict remains relatively smooth; she moves from doubt to peace without much resistant impulse or self-deception actively working against the realization. A touch more friction—fear, resentment, or weariness that doesn’t yield easily—would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid, with a clear history, motive (preservation over destruction), and distinctive sensibility, and her plant-telepathy informs concrete choices. However, her emotional life stays relatively smooth and assured; we see grief and purpose, but little live internal contradiction or moral friction at the moment of unsealing. The final acceptance of her “implanted destiny” lands more as confirmation than as a pressured, costly choice. Adding even a small real doubt or competing obligation in the climax would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mariam’s interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; her trauma history, present coping tactics, and vocation all cohere into a distinct psychology. The linkage between reading her own stress signals and reading plant stress is sharp and character-particular. There is credible contradiction (hope vs. realism; attraction to beauty vs. awareness of its precarity) without being over-explained. The only slight weakness is a mild sheen of therapy-language polish that makes her self-awareness feel a bit textbook at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eleanor’s artistic crisis, fear of fragmentation, and need for “necessary darkness” are clearly motivated and track cleanly from arrival to departure. Her interiority is specific and embodied (the portfolio as armor, mirrors as enemies), and the final shift from seeking unity to accepting multiplicity feels earned. The main limitation is that some realizations arrive in polished thesis form rather than emerging messily under pressure, softening the sense of struggle. Still, the arc from paralysis to a new, riskier artistic stance reads coherent and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Seren is sharply sketched—her obsession with time distortion, the loss of her brother, and her methodical tracking all feel specific and grounded. Motivation is clear and consistent, and her final decision to hunt the nomads for the ink formula is well-earned. Internal contradiction is present but relatively soft (obsessive hunter vs. frozen witness to past trauma) and could be dramatized more on the page rather than explained. Emotional experience is mostly embodied, though a few moments slip toward summary rather than conflicted in-scene feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivations (loyalty to her preserved mother vs moral outrage) are clear, embodied, and carry through to the decisive act, and her professional identity feels grounded. Internal conflict is present on the page rather than merely asserted, especially around retaliation against the frozen. However, the tension resolves a bit too cleanly once Vance appears—her courage never truly wavers—and Vance himself is more function than character, offering limited relational or psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s characterization is rich and specific: the bounty hunter’s daughter who reflexively reaches for the knife, then deliberately re-sheathes it, is an excellent crystallization of her internal conflict. Her pacifism feels earned via backstory (father’s execution, her “senseless” perceptiveness) rather than tacked on. The soldier is thin but serviceable as a catalyst, clearly radiating exhaustion and shame that she responds to. Emotional life could show a bit more friction—anger, fear, or resentment—rather than near-perfect serenity, especially at the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren’s grief, profession, and “cool-headed” nature interlock into a coherent psychology, and her choice to “voice silence” feels earned by the prior emphasis on restraint. The internal contradiction—ice-blooded patience versus hairline cracks of desperation—is specific and dramatized. Her relationship to her daughter is sketched efficiently yet felt in the “splinter” of not-knowing. The only small limitation is that her flaw (emotional reserve) is confronted more lyrically than through a hard, on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaret’s motives (to understand her father, to decide what to tell the world) are clear and specific, and her investigative micro-choices track cleanly to those motives. The internal conflict between truth and protection is present but could sharpen into more simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure. Her father is well-etched through artifacts and annotations, but Margaret’s embodied emotional life remains a bit cool and cerebral. The final choice—“something in between”—is earned yet could register with a slightly clearer felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vera’s motivation—healing inherited guilt by literally re-translating lost love—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices from laboratory specialization to the final ritual. The generational triangle (grandmother/mother/Vera) is economically but vividly sketched, with the letters and the answering machine fragment grounding emotion in concrete objects. Internal conflict (can she actually change the past vs. her need to try) is present but could be sharpened with more on-page ambivalence or risk during the climax. The final release in her chest reads earned and character-rooted, though it leans a bit on summary phrasing rather than lived-through sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and textured—her chalk-stained hands, instinct to “listen differently,” and intuitive reading of both people and patterns feel lived-in and consistent. The old man’s fear and softening are sketched efficiently and give her a real counter-position. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-pressure; she moves from unease to acceptance with little visible resistance or cost. The final stance feels earned but slightly too smooth for the scale of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kira’s motivation and worldview are clear, specific, and consistent, and her retrocognitive curse feels psychologically and somatically embodied rather than abstract. Her gentle-radical stance yields concrete choices (seeking memories instead of weapons, carving Emre’s name) that fit her values. What’s missing at this tier is sharper on-page contradiction—her inner conflict about the cost or futility of this mercy is gestured at rather than dramatized under real pressure. Emre reads more as a powerful emblem than as a character, but that’s appropriate to the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Madeline’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific: an encore-seeking stage ghost redirecting her need for applause into helping the living is compelling and consistent. We get concrete, character-particular perception through her synesthesia and history with the theater. The living woman is more of an emblem than a fully individuated person, which limits relational complexity and visible cost. Madeline’s final renunciation of applause in favor of this quieter role feels earned but could register more sharply if her attachment to fame were dramatized in present action, not mainly in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s characterization as an “affectionate skeptic” is specific, consistent, and drives her actions, especially her shift from disbelief to committed pursuit of Daniel’s breadcrumbs. Her emotions are well embodied through the somatic markers and the light-painting ritual, not just labeled. Internal contradiction (skepticism vs need to believe in Daniel’s survival) is present but could be sharpened under more acute on-page pressure. The final stance—choosing to risk following his pathways—is motivated and coherent, though the cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s professional motivation and worldview are clear and particular (“sensory map maker,” “heat-mapping emotions”), and her actions consistently express those traits. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse; she moves from curiosity to reverence without real internal contest. The lack of visible cost or misstep under pressure keeps her from feeling fully human. She reads more as a finely tuned instrument than a flawed person undergoing change.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe’s vocation, family legacy, and immunity to forgetting give her a specific, coherent identity, and her choice to accept the instructions rather than resist them lands cleanly. However, she encounters little real internal friction; we don’t see simultaneous contradictory impulses (terror vs. awe, duty vs. resentment) under pressure. Her emotional life is sketched more in concept than in embodied, character-particular detail. The final sense of “weight of responsibility” feels earned but not deeply struggled for.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margaret is sharply etched—her scars, history with Viktor, and years of “burned” life coherently drive her refusal to forgive yet decision to act. The internal contradiction (resentment versus responsibility/courage) is present on the page and culminates in a credible Earned Stasis at the end. Viktor’s motives (betrayal for his daughter, desire to vouchsafe information) feel specific and shaded rather than stock. A slight tendency toward aphoristic self-knowledge (“unused courage waits—in the doing, not the feeling”) makes her a touch more articulated than most people under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman and the young woman are both distinct, with motives emerging cleanly from specific details (his decades of practice and superstition, her ink-stained fingers and sleeplessness). His quiet superstition around the needle and her urgency about the promise feel grounded rather than merely stated. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, but the final gift of the needle is psychologically earned. Relationship dynamics (professional distance softening into sympathy) work well within the tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Serin’s vocation and long practice (“forty years at the wheel…expect nothing and accept everything”) create a credible, particular psyche, and her motive—to understand why some places hold when time fractures—clearly drives her actions. The shift from seeking stillness to embracing purposeful movement feels earned by the discovery of the disc. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively gentle; there’s little visible struggle between leaving and staying or between acceptance and curiosity. The characterization is strong but could deepen via more embodied conflict around the cost of remaining.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is specific, embodied, and psychologically consistent; the fire escape, divorces, and her mother's memory create a lived-in sense of who she is. Her micro-choices—waving instead of calling out, using the brass tooth, deciding to prune and replant—align with her cautious, caretaking temperament. Internal conflict is mild rather than sharply contradictory, but there is a believable tension between her pragmatic acceptance of death and the new ache she feels at the rose's loss. The final recommitment to tending and small gestures reads earned and carries a modest, credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s grief, duty, and weariness are clearly established, and her choice to finally use the sundial grows convincingly from the reincarnation revelation. Her interiority is vivid and particular (“calcified around her heart like salt crusts”), and the loneliness vs. purpose tension is credible. The shift from self-imposed exile to caretaker/guide reads earned and forecloses the path of endless, passive preservation. Internal contradiction (duty-bound preserver vs. someone who longs not to be alone) is present but could be pushed harder in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is sharply realized: her vocation, fatigue, and inherited role as keeper of secrets all feel specific and grounded, and her micro-choices (coming without clients, using the good paper, choosing to release her own letter) track cleanly with her motives. The internal conflict—numb competence vs. yearning for authentic connection—is convincing but relatively tidy, with little messy contradiction or genuine risk of refusal. Emotional embodiment leans more toward lyrical perception than fraught, degraded thought under pressure. The final shift in how she will write going forward is earned, though the cost is quiet and modest.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation and competence are clear and specific—her history as an astrophysics grad and lone “interpreter” roots her choices well. We see her act under pressure (welding the door, building and then deploying the transmitter) with a consistent, pragmatic voice. What’s missing at this level is substantial internal contradiction or costed ambivalence; she never seriously wavers or missteps. The relationship pressures (Dean, Aldridge, the campus) stay mostly off-stage, so her emotional cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Helena’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and compelling, especially in the crawl scene where fear and determination coexist on the page. Her inheritance of her grandmother’s quest adds depth and specific emotional stakes. A few lines are label-heavy (“She was a claustrophobic explorer…”) rather than fully dramatized, but mostly the piece shows rather than tells who she is. The final sense of cost—fear endured and joy tinged with grief—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her face blindness and methodical habits, and her lack of instinctive recognition paired with deliberate empathy is compelling. Her motivations—solving the case, humanizing both victim and perpetrator—are clear and consistent. The main limitation is that most of her struggle has already happened off-page in prior study, so we see consolidation rather than live conflict between impulses. Secondary characters exist mostly as concepts (Morrison, Marcus, Elena) rather than active presences, which keeps relationship pressure low.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives—professional skepticism around maps, personal loyalty to her great-grandmother, and the need to be taken seriously—are clear and consistent, with nice details like the copper nail grounding her interiority. Her “nervous confidence” and spongey dread give her a credible contradiction under pressure. The internal arc from doubt to earned purpose is modest but real. Torres functions mainly as a foil; he’s thin but effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margaret is vivid, specific, and consistent: a bridge fiddler whose history with collodion photography and lifetime of “never” clearly motivate her response to the hitchhiker’s offer. Her interiority is concrete (coins, stories, micro-expressions, wet-plate process) and her final decision to step onto the trail is earned by prior regret. The main limitation is that her internal conflict at the moment of choice is a bit too smooth—hesitation or fear is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn as someone trying to outgrow a criminal inheritance, and the father is textured—weathered, regretful, still coded in the old language of stones. Motivation is clear and consistent: escape vs. pull of origin. The internal cost of his “polished calm” is implied (“armor he'd forged”), though a bit more embodied friction in the reunion scene would deepen it. The final micro-choice—to sit, handle the bills, and accept his father’s reframing—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation—grief, guilt, and the need to understand Marcus and the family legacy—is clear and consistent, and her choice to publish reads as an earned change in stance. Interiority is concrete in places (“her bones,” “eyes burning with exhaustion and unshed tears”), though often shaded toward generalized reflection rather than sharply idiosyncratic perception. Internal conflict (her habitual solitude vs. the new commitment to sharing) is present but not deeply dramatized in on-page micro-choices. The story stops short of exposing truly messy or contradictory impulses, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s motivation—to reclaim her erased existence—is clear, particular, and carries through every choice, from trading years of her life to walking the vines with “warlike serenity.” Her guardedness versus her continued seeking creates a believable internal contradiction that the climax resolves when she straightens and claims “I exist.” Emotional states are embodied (spine like a fortress, cold burning into her palm) rather than abstractly labeled. The only minor limitation is that the realization about the curse’s origin is delivered a bit neatly, bordering on explanatory rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is vivid and particular: root-bound visionary, bodily marked by her visions, with a clear, lifelong drive to map dream-geography. Her motivation to reach the intersection and to serve as an anchor is coherent and pays off in her final realization. Internal conflict—fear of chaos vs attraction to possibility—is present but under-dramatized on the page, mostly stated rather than tested. The seven others are evocative but remain emblematic figures rather than fully pressured characters.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation (the “hole in her chest” and the stolen destiny) is clear and governs every choice, and her acceptance of uncertainty at the end feels earned. The interiority is specific and not generic, though it could carry a bit more active, embodied conflict at the moment of decision. The Gardener’s presence and attitude sharpen her resolve but remain secondary. Emotional progression is credible, just a touch streamlined for top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich and specific—his mix of technical competence and emotional wreckage feels particular, and details like his involuntary grip on the cloth embody that conflict. His motivation (shame after the viral failure, displacement into the quarry) is clear and tracks into the final decision to walk down into the pit. The relationship with Val is compact but effective, with a believable shift from suspicion to tentative respect. The only soft note is that his late-stage “purpose doesn’t disappear, it transforms” insight flirts with neatness, though it’s still grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and coherent—her “kindly methodical” cataloguing of grief and her lifelong preoccupation with transition both feel character-particular and motivate her choice to stay. The core decision (to remain at the arbor and reestablish the practice) is credibly rooted in her traits, history, and relationship with Vasil. Internal contradiction is present but muted: curiosity vs. the implied cost is more stated than dramatized, with little real resistance on the page. The caretaker is thin but functional as a pressure-bearing secondary figure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is specific, embodied, and professionally particular; her history with "smelting" and her oscillation between strength and vulnerability feel lived-in. The internal contradiction—routine versus futility, multiplicity versus singular truth—is clear but resolved mostly in reflection rather than pressured choice. The fisherman functions less as a true crucible than a foil to cue her stated philosophy. The closing endurance feels credible but low-cost, keeping this short of top-tier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and motivated, with clear flaws (emotional fortification, fear of vulnerability) that directly shape her choices in the cave. The parallel between literal bunkers and her “bunkers around my heart” is earned through scene rather than retrofitted. The shift from dutiful inspector to someone risking emotional exposure is plausible and costed. The only minor limitation is a slight reliance on familiar therapeutic idiom where a more idiosyncratic emotional texture could deepen her uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s guilt, professional identity as river chronicler, and history with Daniel are specific and coherent, and her choices (stopping meds, returning to the station, deciding to go to the black stones) are well-motivated. Her “daringly methodical” habit is dramatized in how she uses maps and statistics, not just labeled. The main limitation is that her internal conflict in the present scene is more often summarized (what she once did, what she now understands) than put under immediate pressure. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page (e.g., a real temptation to retreat back to numbness) would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Veiled Dreamer’s motives are clear and consistent—find the library, decode the watch, face her mother’s unsaid words—and her final forgiveness feels earned by the emotional groundwork. Interiority is specific (the watch, the shelves’ colors, the weight of the letters) rather than generic. The mother is well-sketched through absence and handwriting, giving the relationship credible weight despite her off-page status. The only limit at this length is that her contradictory impulses (hunger vs. fear) are more implied than dramatized in on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific: a provenance researcher caught between validating an empire and preserving an erased culture, and this tension drives every choice. Her interiority is textured via embodied images (coffee stains, plant whispers, the feel of the ice violin) rather than abstract emotion labels. The final renunciation—forswearing the promise by shattering the violin—is credibly earned from the accumulated conflict. The only limitation is that her internal struggle at the peak reads slightly pre-resolved; the choice feels agonizing but not quite knife-edge ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is specific and alive on the page—her profession, history with her mother, and sensory/attentional habits feel integrated rather than labeled. Her motivation (answering the dream, saving the last spark) is clear and consistent, but there is limited on-page contradiction or messy ambivalence under pressure. The emotional beats are embodied (preparing her mother’s body, the chip against her chest) rather than abstract. The final internal shift—seeing her work as sacred bridge—is earned, if somewhat smooth and unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is clear, specific, and consistent: the devoted caretaker whose work is entangled with maternal abandonment and forgiveness. Her interiority is concrete (the hairpin as focus, climbing to think) and her final conceptual shift about her mother feels earned by the backstory and Theron’s passing. Internal conflict—caretaker composure vs. lingering hurt—is present but could be dramatized more in-scene rather than resolved mainly in reflection. Theron is lightly but effectively sketched; their dynamic is tender, though the relationship isn’t really put under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper and Sera both feel particular and psychologically coherent, with motives clearly rooted in the scenario (Sera’s need for permission; the keeper’s guarded vocation). The keeper’s interior contradiction—wanting to help while keeping emotional distance—comes through in details like “sincerely insincere” and “protected vulnerability.” Sera’s desperation (“eyes held the particular desperation of someone who had made a decision but couldn't live with it”) is convincing, though her inner life remains somewhat schematic compared to the keeper’s. The final stance—holding two truths about her sister—is earned by prior dialogue and image work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen and Vara are cleanly motivated, with his backward aging and her erased village giving them specific drives, and their status dynamic is clear and engaging. However, there is little genuine friction between them—Vara is almost perfectly receptive—which softens interior conflict. The emotional cost of his impending vanishing is gestured at (“strange grief of youth”) but not deeply dramatized in his behavior. The final charged moment is earned conceptually more than through visible micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vessa’s motivation—trading motion for a vocation of stillness and navigation—is clear, specific, and coherently sustained, and her rare smile at the prospect of a student provides a nice, character-revealing crack in that stillness. The internal tension between her renunciation of movement and her desire for an heir to “inherit the knowing” is present but could be dramatized more sharply under pressure. The traveler is lightly sketched but adequate for this scope; the focus remains firmly and appropriately on Vessa. The final renunciation (“stop climbing forever”) feels earned by her history and worldview, though the emotional cost could be embodied a touch more.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—from “underachieving mage” craving some non-mechanical magic to someone who chooses witnessing over extraction—and her final renunciation is earned by the climb and the satchel beat. Interiority is specific (“being half-remembered,” “light that lingered because she had finally stopped trying to force it”) and fits her insecure but quietly stubborn nature. The internal conflict between wanting measurable achievement and seeking unquantifiable meaning is present but could be sharpened under more pressure at the keystone. Emotional embodiment leans more lyrical than visceral, but it still feels character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s grief, dutiful temperament, and late-blooming curiosity are rendered with specificity, and his choice to miss the festival to honor Elena’s secret supplies a clear value hierarchy. His interiority is concrete (“meteor hush,” the feel of the key tag, the memory of vows) rather than generic, and his realization at the vial’s opening feels earned by prior beats. The endurance he chooses at the end—returning to ordinary life while permanently altered—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that his internal contradictions (duty vs resentment, fear vs desire to know) are present but not deeply torn-open on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation—remembering the future/un-happening and aligning her consciousness with the contracting universe—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. The tension between her “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” gives her a credible internal conflict that pays off when she finally commits to trusting the backwards prophecy. Emotional states are mostly embodied through image and action (coins, static, blue-shifting stars) rather than labels. The only limit is that her individuality beyond vocation and metaphysical stance stays somewhat abstract, keeping this just short of fully piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—her guilt over breaking “the first rule” and her burden of others’ unfinished words feel particular rather than generic. Her micro-choices (coming to the observatory, using Elias’s atlas, deciding to complete the phrases) all track cleanly with that burden. The shift from being “a reaper drowning in the residue of human regret” to someone who can “hold sorrow gently” is earned by the on-page process. The only slight limitation is that her conflict resolves somewhat cleanly for the length, with little visible resistance or relapse.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corin’s characterization is specific and memorable—“lukewarm at best,” with brittle devotion and earnest naivety that clearly inform his actions. His interiority is concrete (thinking in “dripping rates,” measuring silence like honey) and ties directly to what he does. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-grade; we’re told his devotion is brittle, yet we never see him come close to abandoning the attempt on the page. The final endurance feels earned but would land harder if the cost or temptation to quit were more acutely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Martha’s interior life is specific and coherent: her job, her curated story about her father, and her compulsion to patrol the boundary between hidden and revealed all align. The contradiction between needing a heroic father and confronting his abandonment is credibly dramatized in her response to the final photograph. A few key motivations are articulated in abstract terms (“precisely humane,” “to control the narrative”) instead of arising purely from enacted conflict, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to reconcile logic and intuition through a risky final transformation—is clear, consistent, and tightly tied to her history with her mother and the Academy. Her interiority is specific (the crystal from the grave, the hidden sentimentality) and embodied rather than generic. The final change into someone “new and ancient simultaneously” is well-earned by prior beats and forecloses her former way of compartmentalizing herself. The only limitation is that her internal struggle never quite frays into genuine doubt or self-sabotage under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera is sharply drawn: competent yet haunted, torn between instinct and learned caution, and her micro-choices (partial evacuation, repeated recalibration, crossing out conclusions) feel rooted in that tension. The relationship with her dead mother, focused through the parachute buckle, gives her motivation texture beyond duty. Her commitment to honesty undercuts the “seer who always knows” trope and creates a credible flaw: she risks panic and loss of trust rather than offer certainty. The final endurance—choosing to keep watching while carrying doubt—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivations for all three—Kira, Vex, Sera—are lucid and rooted in the premise, and the complementary flaws (numbness vs overload) are a strong engine. However, the story leans on Kira’s diagnostic exposition (“you are both trying to defeat emotional numbness”) rather than dramatizing those contradictions more fully in action or interiority. The reconciliation—Vex extending her hand, Sera taking it—lands a bit too quickly and cleanly for the years of hatred invoked. More embodied, moment-to-moment conflict in their reactions would deepen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s motives (protecting her idiosyncratic escape rooms from corporate standardization) are clear and consistent, and her choice to double down by designing “The Corpse Flower” is well motivated. Interiority is specific and grounded in her professional lens, but we rarely see truly conflicting impulses in-scene—there’s little felt temptation toward Magnus’s offer, so the cost remains somewhat conceptual. Her micro-choices (how to interpret the seed, how to respond to the looming buyout) track cleanly with her worldview, yielding a credible earned stasis. Emotional embodiment leans more lyrical than visceral, which keeps her slightly abstracted rather than fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Victor’s grief and motivation are sharply drawn, with the specific oddity of his profession giving his interiority texture rather than feeling gimmicky. His actions in the tunnel—arranging photos, choosing songs, persisting through emotional pain—track cleanly with his need to unmake silence. The push-pull between his desire to reconnect and his fear of the memories he’s stirring is present, though the final readiness to call Margaret lands a touch neatly. Overall, his characterization feels particular, embodied, and psychologically credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and textured—“interiorizing exteriors” and becoming part of the landscape is a distinctive coping strategy that feels psychologically credible. Her choice to reveal herself, then to ask the woman to stay, is clearly motivated by loneliness and homesickness without becoming sentimental. The newcomer’s despair is sketched efficiently yet convincingly, and the status dynamic (Maren as feral custodian vs. lost cultist) is legible. The only ding is that some of Maren’s wisdom edges toward articulated thesis rather than emerging purely through conflicted behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motivation to save Petra from the Vermillion Succession is clear, specific, and consistently drives every choice. Her “hopeless alchemist” stance and “stoically sensitive” nature give her interiority a distinct contradiction that feels lived-in rather than labeled. The micro-choices around how much emotion she permits herself (“one moment of feeling”) land as earned, not rhetorical. Because no other character is on the page, we don’t see relationship dynamics under immediate pressure, which slightly limits the emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular (“to find the beginning in every ending”), and her occupational lens feels lived-in. However, she faces little genuine pressure or contradiction—her competence is never strained beyond a brief puzzle, and we don’t see a conflicting impulse or real cost. The breakdown of “fantasy vs. machinery” is interesting but doesn’t quite flower into internal conflict. Her tears at the climax register emotionally but without a specific personal tether, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific—the wry cheerfulness (“Beautiful evening for a dissolving, isn't it?”) in an impossible situation feels earned and consistent. Her motivation to fix the Meridian’s limbo is clear and rooted in personal history (grandmother, dual memories). However, her internal conflict is underplayed: she recognizes the risk of splitting but never seriously wavers, so the final cost lands more conceptually than emotionally. A bit more on-the-page ambivalence or fear at the key choice would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s motives (reclaiming the gallery, “discover[ing] the texture of connection,” negotiating sanity vs. certainty) are clear and consistent, and her actions track well with those motives. The fever rewiring and the building as her symptom externalized give her a distinct interior logic. However, her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized; we’re told about the choice between sanity and certainty rather than feeling that contradiction bite in the present scene. The final acceptance reads earned but could carry more visible emotional cost if her ambivalence were sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vara is clearly motivated—a seasoned navigator confronting the obsolescence of her methods—and her shift from clinging to the “anchor” to setting it down is convincingly earned. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (thinking of her cadets, GPS, “painting by numbers”) rather than generic. However, her emotional experience remains largely conceptual and reflective; we rarely see contradictory impulses fully in play on the page, and she and Tessek occasionally slide into roles as thematic mouthpieces rather than fully embodied individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera and Margaret are both economically but distinctly drawn—Vera’s curiosity and solitude, Margaret’s brittle guilt and age-worn grief land cleanly in a short span. Motivation is clear and consistent, and Margaret’s emotional progression from tension to release feels earned. However, Vera lacks a visible internal contradiction under pressure; she never hesitates, doubts, or pays an on-page emotional price for serving as this bridge. The relationship dynamic is moving but relatively straightforward, with little status or power shift beyond the obvious caregiver/seekers roles.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s fear of enclosed spaces versus her compulsion to witness the dead is a clean, specific contradiction that drives every choice, and her embodied reactions (tightened chest, forcing herself to stay) feel earned rather than declared. Her professional competence balances with genuine struggle so she never reads as a stock fearless explorer. The main limitation is that her interior conflict remains steady rather than sharpening into a sharper, riskier irrational moment under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific—she wants to reclaim the “failures” archived in her digital ghost—and her habits (heartbeat counting, keeping the shard) feel lived-in rather than labelled. The emotional throughline from bureaucratic erasure to existential self-proof is coherent and credible. Internal conflict is present (fear of facing grief vs. need to re-integrate), though it rarely pushes her into truly contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation of heartbeat-counting is well-earned by the prior interiority and reads as a real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation (to revive her people’s language at personal risk) is clear and consistent, and her copper-veined body/history feel integrated rather than decorative. Her emotional life is textured—trembling hands, specific sensory memories—but internal conflict (fear of losing her voice vs obligation to ancestors) is more implied than dramatized in real resistance. She succeeds relatively smoothly once the mechanism is understood, so we see less genuine struggle or error than a top-tier piece would show.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete obsessions (years chasing legends, reputation sacrificed), and Samuel’s bitterness and petty grandiosity come through vividly via his leaked confession. Her temptation toward the same vindictive arc is clearly established and then redirected into a different value hierarchy. The final choice—to “tell his story without bitterness”—feels earned by what we’ve learned of her, though the cost of that renunciation could be shaded with slightly more ambivalence. Overall, characterization is rich and particular with only light telling (“She had been bitter too”) skimming the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her practiced heart rhythms, her weeping over the locust shell before she understands why, and her calculated softness under surveillance all feel character-particular. Motivation (quiet defiance, then catalyzing open transformation) is clear and escalates credibly. The moment of “Mira understood now” is earned by prior set-up rather than a bolt-from-the-blue epiphany. The only limitation is that we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt at the climax; once she chooses, the shift is fairly smooth and undebated.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s motivation is clear, particular, and affective: he ferries others’ promises in the hope of balancing a cosmic ledger and recovering his father. His professional competence and almost ritualized method give him texture beyond “kind smuggler.” The internal contradiction—describing his drive as “simpler and more desperate” while enacting near-heroic risk—could be sharpened on the page through a moment of doubt or fear in the present scene. The young woman is sketched economically and credibly, but remains more a receiver of grief than a fully pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s vocation, loss of voice, and relationship to silence and craft are specific and coherent, and his choices (entering the train, taking the halo, attempting to sing, deciding to stay) all follow naturally from that spine. His emotional life is mostly embodied in touch and sound (or its absence), which helps avoid generic feeling-labels. What’s missing, at a top-tier level, is sharper in-scene contradiction—fear vs hope, despair vs superstition—at the moment he tries to sing, which would deepen the sense of risk. The change at the end (choosing this train as home and workshop) feels earned but relatively unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor is vivid and specific—her inherited duty, the scarf habit, and the grandmother relationship all feel grounded and coherent. Her core drive (to find the place where stories live) is clear and her reactions track well to events. What’s thinner is live internal contradiction under pressure; she rarely wavers or pays a palpable emotional price on the page for her obsession. The final shift to “her work truly began” is earned but a bit too frictionless to feel fully crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam’s longing and obsession are clear, consistent, and rooted in specific history, and her micro-choices (taking the job, climbing to the roof despite the fog, persisting with experiments) track well with that drive. Emotional texture is strong but not especially conflicted—she doesn’t often act against herself or reveal sharp internal contradiction, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. Her shift at the end into acceptance/translation of loss is earned and legible as an internal reconfiguration. Secondary characters are offstage abstractions, but that’s appropriate to this focused, single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is precise and compelling, and her competence as a “locksmith between dimensions” is well dramatized through tactile focus on the ribbon and hair. Emotional interiority is solid but leans into clean, almost idealized certainty rather than showing real contradiction or wobble under pressure. Elena, as an off-page presence, is vivid enough to matter but largely functions symbolically. The final choice to “rewrite the mechanism” is motivated, though the emotional cost of that act could be more richly conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to recover her grandmother and herself from encroaching erasure—is clear, specific, and drives every choice on the page, from returning to the greenhouse to trusting the folk remedy. Her professional identity as a folklorist and her chronic curiosity are woven into her methods rather than left as labels. The emotional turn when the jar is opened feels earned by that buildup and lands with a credible, embodied cost (“Elara wept among the petrified apple trees…”). The main limitation is that her internal conflict (fear vs. need, skepticism vs. belief) is more implied than dramatized beat-by-beat, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation and inner conflict are sharply drawn—her blend of backward-walking anxiety, analytical rigor, and “combative tenderness” feels specific and earned, and her final decision grows convincingly from that mix. The mirroring with her own reversed exile enriches stakes without feeling contrived. Thessaly functions as a subtle crucible, pressing but not railroading her choice. A minor softness is that Mira can articulate the thematic calculus with near-perfect clarity, slightly muting the messier, less verbal edges of such a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marek’s motivation and values are clear and consistent, and his vocation as a pruner is well integrated with his choices. His quiet endurance and late-life decision to finally plant the seed feel earned by the preceding decades of tending. However, he experiences little active internal contradiction on the page; the piece tells us more about his patience than it dramatizes genuine inner struggle. The result is strong, lucid characterization that stops short of the complexity expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s guilt, former vocation, and current compulsion are clear, and her choice to unravel rather than mend feels organically rooted in that history. The relationship with Callum serves as a crucible that forces her to articulate her motives (“Because I broke things I cannot fix”), deepening characterization. Her internal arc from paralysis to a new philosophy of visible cracks is earned and specific. A touch more moment-to-moment contradiction under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s characterization is specific and textured—her occupation, “notes on her notes,” and belief about maps all coherently motivate her obsessive re-examination of the footage and her stance toward the chapel. The interiority feels grounded rather than generic, and her empathy for silence is credibly tied to her professional habits. However, internal conflict (duty to the council vs. allegiance to the chapel’s “voice,” curiosity vs. fear) remains mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in on-page choices. The final decision to keep typing without looking up suggests an earned stance, but its cost is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor is sharply etched: a seasoned, grieving scientist whose losses and professional discipline clearly motivate this dive and her reactions to the artifacts. The detail that she’s “on a first name basis with death” is borne out in her composure and the way she reads the captain’s acceptance. Internal contradiction (analytic vs. overwhelmed) is present but more stated than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices. Her final readiness to surface with a reconfigured stance toward grief feels earned by the prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s role and motives are clear and consistent—she’s the intermediary who encodes the ghost’s fragments into song, and her inherited craft gives her a grounded emotional core. However, she’s almost entirely without contradiction or real resistance; she understands and accepts her role very quickly, which flattens potential internal conflict. The ghost’s prior-life struggle (“could never articulate their needs”) is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping them more thematic than characterful. The final shift—Mira taking on the ghost’s pattern—is earned but carries little visible psychological cost beyond a quiet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization is clear, coherent, and specific—her history as a servant, her connection to her mother, and her emotional stance around grief all line up and motivate her ascent. Her warm inquisitiveness is nicely grounded in her attention to other servants’ sorrows and in her use of the diary, not just as a plot device but as a lens on others. However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or uncertainty in the present scene, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional under pressure. Lady Vesper is sketched with a few strong strokes but remains more emblem than character.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and grounded in her profession and grief, and the father relationship is efficiently sketched yet vivid. Her new “cataloging” work arises credibly from loss and temperament. The contradiction—rational meteorologist vs. quasi-mystic archivist—is present but could be sharpened in on-page moments of doubt or self-rebuke. Her final stance feels earned but carries relatively low visible cost beyond a gentle acceptance of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s perceptual world and competence are vivid and specific, and her tactile way of knowing gives her a distinct interiority. Motivation is clear (follow the coin, honor the scholars, salvage something before destruction), and her final choice to walk away with the artifacts reads as an earned, if quiet, stance. What’s missing at this level is sharper internal contradiction or visible struggle—she moves through the story with impressive poise and little emotional fracture under pressure. The lack of a live on-page relationship also limits the crucible effect that might deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity, professionalism, and loneliness are clearly established and consistently motivate her actions, especially her obsessive work through the night. The map-apprentice training informs what she notices and how she problem-solves, giving her a distinct interior lens. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild—she rarely feels genuinely torn between fear, despair, and wonder—so the emotional price of her choices remains understated. The final beat (her grinning beside the hopscotch board) lands as satisfying but emotionally safe rather than deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific (to learn the “rhythm of repair”), and her internal conflict about fixing vs. letting go is dramatized in the mirror hall and the hesitation over the vial. Her emotions are embodied enough—cold biting, breath hanging, fingers trembling—not just labeled. The final choice to uncap the vial and embrace a non-restorative concept of repair feels earned by prior training and memory. There could be slightly more irrational resistance or darker flaw to push her beyond near-idealized competence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly sketched as caretaker and community anchor, with believable habits (waking early, leaving her own message) and relationships (with Sola, with Marcus) that feel lived-in. The ghost’s motivation as penitent helper is concise yet specific, and his refusal to join them in person is emotionally credible. Internal contradiction is present but mild: Elara wants him integrated yet quickly accepts his distance, so the tension never fully sharpens into a difficult choice. The ending registers as a quiet endurance rather than a major character turn, which suits the piece but limits impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, particular, and moving: she wants not to avert apocalypse but to send a lullaby to her lost child and all children. Her competence with “nested patterns” and long apprenticeship grounds her authority in the scene. The main weakness is that her inner life in the present moment is largely unidirectional—grief and purpose—without much on-page contradiction or doubt under pressure. A sharper, simultaneous pull between duty to humanity and selfish desire for Elena would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and grounded in a specific history; her competence feels earned (orchard training → labyrinth skill), and the reluctant-burden arc pays off in the ending. However, her inner conflict about the orchard and the cost of returning to it are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in the present scene. The relationship beat with the travelers is functional but thin—there’s little emotional specificity beyond gratitude. The final acceptance of her role is believable but could carry more bite if her reluctance surfaced more actively in the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s grief, professional mindset, and shift from clinging to loss toward enabling healing are clearly motivated and consistent, with the polymer work flowing naturally from who she is. Interiority is specific and embodied through how she reads foam, chrysalides, and lab decisions. The main limitation is a slight tidiness and occasional therapy-adjacent abstraction around “atonement” and “transformation” that smooths over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s characterization is rich and specific: ex-forger, parolee, now “clean slate vendor” with a clear tension between institutional math and her own hunger for origin and authenticity. Her interiority is grounded in concrete objects (bracelet, slates, moonlight) rather than abstractions, and the child’s presence efficiently reflects her own liminal state. The internal change at the end—redefining where stories begin—is credibly earned from prior reflection and action, though the cost of that shift remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. Secondary character (the child) is thin but appropriate for the scope and function.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and specific—her inherited remorse, her curse, and the desire “to sandpaper rough memories” all align cleanly with her choices. The internal conflict at the pavilion (relief vs. fear of losing what pain has taught her) is sharp, if a bit swiftly resolved. Her profession and curse inform her worldview in concrete ways (the onion, the fish, the lamb), which grounds her. A touch more embodied struggle in the decision moment would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s vocation, temperament (“empathetically decisive”), and long preparation give her strong, specific motivation, and her embodied details (tears wiped “with vigorous, purposeful strokes”) feel character-particular. However, she faces almost no active resistance, so we see limited contradictory impulses or genuinely pressured choices. Her internal arc is more endurance/fulfillment than change, and the cost of her commitment remains largely conceptual. Strong, but shy of the richest psychological complexity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Vera’s core motive and temperament are clear and specific—the helix-thinking engineer drawn to broken things, willing to self-modify to archive abandoned dreams. Her interiority is vivid in how she responds to the influx of lives (“wept and laughed simultaneously”), but she faces little on-page ambivalence or resistance. The transformation into “keeper” feels emotionally grounded yet almost entirely chosen rather than contested. A touch more contradictory impulse or fear would deepen her beyond a strong, single-vector desire.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s prism-minded perception is distinctive and her vocation as archivist is well-woven into how she interprets the world, giving her a credible, specific motivation for risking the grotto. Her internal turn—from seeker of combinations to self-aware guardian—is motivated by what she witnesses during inversion and by the “gardeners of secrets” lineage. However, her emotional life stays relatively smooth; we get little embodied fear, doubt, or real temptation to turn away from the burden. The ending renunciation/acceptance feels right but could land harder with more visible ambivalence or cost in her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation—to salvage music in a world where sound no longer carries—is clear, specific, and drives every beat from study to experimentation to breakthrough. Her interiority (tree-song training, aching hands, symphonic thinking) feels particular rather than generic. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or internal conflict; she never seriously wavers or errs in a way that complicates her pursuit. The final shift toward “teaching others” is earned but emotionally gentle, without a strongly felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Helena is specific, embodied, and consistent—her exile, pedagogical philosophy, and relationship to the worry stone all feel particular rather than generic. Her motivation to preserve a forbidden, more nuanced understanding of chess is clear and drives her actions in the scene. However, her internal conflict remains relatively soft; we don’t see a strong contrary impulse (e.g., bitterness, despair, or temptation to give up) tested on the page, which limits the felt cost of her final stance. The change at the end reads as an earned acceptance more than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera is distinct, with a coherent blend of pacifism, quasi-spiritual science, and grief driving her choices. Her motivation to open the clasp by nonviolent means is well-rooted in her established worldview. The internal turn—discovering she came to forgive rather than to decode—is plausible, if a bit tidily articulated. The main weakness is that contradictory impulses (resentment vs. love, need-to-know vs. acceptance) are more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s goals, skills, and flaw (olfactory sensitivity) are clear and consistently dramatized, and her final decision to leave rather than stay is motivated by what she’s learned. Her interiority feels particular—smelling environments as information, translating experience into sketches—rather than generic. The internal conflict between careerist ambition and a more mystical yearning for “undercurrent of wisdom” is present but resolved a bit tidily, with little messy resistance in the final beat. Thessaly functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than as a fully pressuring counter-presence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motive (saving her family’s poisoned orchards) is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, and the grandmother connection personalizes the quest well. Her competence as a pilot and her reverence for the place give her a distinct, credible interiority. However, the internal conflict—fear vs. duty, grief vs. wonder—stays relatively smooth and tidy, especially around the epiphany. The final acceptance (“she could not take the source home”) lands, but the emotional cost of that renunciation could be more sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn—competent, haunted, methodical—with clear motivation rooted in her father and Vasquez, and her habits (patch, notebooks, solitary surveys) all reveal character. The blend of guilt and duty is specific and embodied (“the patch pressed against her thigh…”), not generic. Internal contradiction is present but could be heightened: she feels responsible yet there’s little on-page wobble in her certainty about method or risk, so pressure never quite cracks her composure. The ending maintains an earned stasis rather than a transformation, which is appropriate but keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Meren’s core motivation and history are clear and specific, and her synesthesia meaningfully shapes how she perceives and acts. However, her emotional path is relatively smooth and unconflicted—she is competent, rarely doubts, and faces little inner resistance in the bell-ringing itself. The seventeen-year quest is told efficiently but not deeply dramatized in terms of personal cost beyond a line or two. The final realization about wonder lands, but it feels more like an intellectual reframing than a hard-won, ambivalent shift.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—her need to understand the past failure credibly drives her to break an oath. Interiority is concrete (“The failure still lived in her bones”) and tied to present action. The conflict between loyalty to Verren and her obsession with understanding is strong but could be sharpened with one more moment of hesitation or temptation under peak pressure. The closing stance—accepting a solitary, risk-laden guardianship—is well earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her “mathematics of emotion” fixation, the drowned poet overlay, the way the halo intensifies her grief all feel particular and embodied. Her core motivation (to solve emotion as if it were math) is consistent and clearly drives her actions, and the final shift to embracing harmony over formula is earned. The main limitation is that conflict is almost entirely internal and somewhat smooth; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine risk of her clinging to the old paradigm. Still, the closing choice to keep printing with a new understanding credibly reconfigures her before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s interiority is clear, specific, and consistent—her trembling, efficiency, and gradual revaluation of her role feel grounded, and her final shift from “duty” to “devotion” is earned by prior beats. The courier training vs. the new mandate to linger provides a believable internal tension, though it’s handled gently rather than as a sharply dramatized conflict. Her key change (from transaction to pilgrimage, from speed to slowness) is legible and feels like a real before/after. The main limitation is that her struggle is relatively low-friction; she adjusts without much visible resistance or cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—prove her “romantic nonsense” theory and honor her grandmother—and her methodical, quasi-scientific temperament comes through in concrete behaviors (documentation, parking overnight, experimental framing). The internal contradiction between “attentive mystic” and empiricist is interesting but mostly asserted rather than put under real pressure. Her shift from external validation to personal confirmation is believable, though the cost of giving up on wider proof is only lightly sketched. The lack of an on-page relational crucible or strong competing impulse keeps the arc from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in family history; the inheritance of the loom and the bead concretely drive her willingness to sacrifice. Her interiority is well-differentiated from generic “dutiful child” archetypes through her relationship to threads, silence, and the loom. However, her emotional path from apprehension to acceptance is almost too seamless—there’s little contradictory impulse or on-page hesitation at the point of self-erasure. A touch more visible friction at the moment of unraveling would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Oren is clearly motivated—loss of purpose and attachment to the planet drive him toward the mines and the bargain, and his decision to accept a long, costly path is credible. His meekness plus persistence are dramatized through patient descent and years of work, not just labels. However, internal contradiction is lightly sketched; we rarely feel simultaneous fear/hope or doubt/resolve in scene, so his arc reads smooth rather than pressured. The choice to stay and pay the price is moving but could cut deeper emotionally with more embodied hesitation or irrationality at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to understand her mother’s disappearance and the nature of her gift—is clear, consistent, and drives every beat. Her embodied relationship to surfaces and the shard gives her interiority some specificity. However, she faces little on-page ambivalence about risking herself; the decision to continue her mother’s dangerous work feels moving but not meaningfully contested. The mother is sketched effectively through a short confrontation, but we don’t see Mira’s flaws or contradictions complicate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s reticence, inherited duty, and relationship to the sea create a coherent, particular interiority, and her final decision to speak/write feels earned from her history of silence. Her micro-choices—climbing, reading, deciphering the cairn, pledging to protect the chain—align cleanly with that motivation. The emotional conflict is mostly internal (silence vs. connection) and could carry a slightly sharper sense of risk or flaw, but it’s credible at this scale. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting the burden of carrying light she cannot keep) closes a believable character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Herald is vivid, with clear vocation and motivation, and her joy-melancholy mix feels particular rather than generic. However, she encounters almost no resistance or dilemma on the page, so her endurance of the role is more asserted than tested. Internal contradiction is gestured at (“a strange joy, tinged with melancholy”) but never forces a real choice. The character is strong and memorable, but the piece stops short of putting her under meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Senna’s guilt, curiosity, and disorientation in her “borrowed life” are embodied and particular, with the involuntary confession as the strongest moment of character under pressure. Her motivation for coming to the valley is clear and carries through to the final decision to stay. The dye master is sketched efficiently with a distinct presence and history with Mei-Lin, though he functions more as sage than as a fully conflicted character. The final choice to remain feels earned but relatively low-cost, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren is specific and grounded—a long-time labyrinth keeper with a tactile relationship to her work, grief, and the trees. Her motivation to understand Vestris’s note and her own quantified sorrow is clear and drives each step. The emotional arc from confusion to acceptance of a larger custodial role is credible, if somewhat low-conflict and low-cost. Internal contradiction (duty vs. burden, curiosity vs. fear) could be sharpened to push this into more searing territory.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority—her failing memory contrasted with embodied, almost instinctive song—is vivid and specific, and her final acceptance of losing her selfhood to restore communal memory feels motivated and costly. However, her internal conflict (clinging to remaining identity vs surrendering it) is more implied than actively dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. She reads as a strong archetype more than a fully individuated, idiosyncratic person, which slightly blunts the impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Miriam is sharply drawn: the hotline work, letters to strangers, and self-imposed exile all cohere into a psychologically credible pattern of punishment and protection. Her contradictory impulses—hiding vs. watching, absence vs. presence—are dramatized rather than merely stated, and her final stance (“She was still hiding. She was also finally found.”) feels earned. The librarian is more emblematic than individuated, but that suits his function as catalyst rather than co-protagonist. A touch of diagnostic phrasing (“Being keenly empathetic…”) edges toward abstraction but does not undercut the emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mei’s characterization is rich and specific—her noticing, past rage, and current “heuristically gentle” stance feel earned and consistent, and her actions (sitting in the tea house, planting the wheat) arise cleanly from those traits. The internal conflict between the burden of remembering and the temptation to normalize forgetting is present but could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine temptation or cost on the page. Emotional states are mostly embodied through concrete perception (frost, spider, bread), though a few phrases (“heuristically gentle approach”) drift toward abstraction. The final endurance—continuing to plant and notice despite no answers—is a credible, earned stasis with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, patience, and sense of duty are vivid and consistent, and her small physical habits (“gently meticulous precision,” the way she measures and moves) align with that characterization. Her motivation—to save something meaningful as everything collapses—is clear and holds throughout. However, the internal conflict over which vow to choose feels emotionally underdeveloped for the scale of the loss; she finds “the one” quickly and with little dramatized struggle. That keeps the choice from fully exposing deeper contradictions or flaws in her.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s motivation (protecting the truce and her father’s legacy) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her learned patience from moonshining nicely informs her tactics. Interiority is concrete (“comforting unease,” the crescents in her skin, the warmth of the fob) and particular to her history. However, internal conflict is relatively mild—she rarely seems genuinely torn, which slightly flattens the emotional stakes. The final stance as “keeper of silence” feels earned but could land harder with a sharper sense of what it costs her beyond risk and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid and specific—her skepticism, sensory habits, and relationship to her brother and grandmother all feel grounded and individual. Her motivation (to understand weather-carriers) is clear and consistently drives attention and interpretation. The shift from “luminous skeptic” to someone who recognizes her own weather-carrying role is believable and earned, though the cost is more conceptual than emotionally jagged. Secondary characters are archetypal but functional, pressing her with information rather than fully dramatized relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s inner life is specific and textured: the inherited prohibition against art, her mnemonic gift, and her cave-keeper competence all cohere into a credible psychology. The moment where she reads the broken lock as proof of her grandmother’s own struggle is a strong, character-revealing inference. Internal conflict between obedience/fear and artistic need runs through the piece and culminates in a clear, earned shift when she finally draws. The only weakness is a touch of summary shorthand around the “inescapable calling” that edges toward abstraction rather than being fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mei Lin is sharply sketched, with a concrete craft, a specific physiological relationship to dishonesty, and a clear emotional throughline from the letter to the Archive to the inscription. Her motivation (needing truth but fearing what it does to her) is consistent and plausibly intensified by each discovery. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened—she moves fairly smoothly from hurt to understanding without much on-page resistance or uglier ambivalence. The final act of inscribing the door feels earned and character-specific, though the personal cost sits more in summary than in a fraught in-scene choice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s vocation, muteness, and sensory attunement create a specific, believable specialist whose choices directly drive the piece. Her motivation—to restore the bell’s truth and preserve wonder—is clear and consistent, and her nonverbal exchanges with Alcuin are effective. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; she encounters little genuine doubt or temptation in the moment, which slightly softens the arc. Still, the final sense that she may relinquish her returned voice feels earned by what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    VERA-7’s motivation—to relieve accumulating “static” from decades of absorbed grief—is clear, specific, and consistently tied to her history as caretaker. Her choices (saving the box, designing the protocols, finally using them on herself-by-proxy) feel earned. The internal conflict (attachment vs. the need to destroy what she’s hoarded) is present but could surface with a bit more on-page hesitation or friction at the decision moment. Still, her arc toward a quieter, earned stasis reads psychologically credible and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren and Mrs. Okonkwo are cleanly sketched with clear motives, and Maren’s profession dovetails well with her compulsion to solve emotional mysteries. However, Maren reads slightly idealized—preternaturally perceptive and composed—with little visible internal contradiction under pressure. The granddaughter’s psychology is inferred but never embodied on the page, so the relational crucible remains one step abstracted. The final offer to “bring her here” feels earned, but the emotional cost for Maren herself is relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is sharply sketched—her embodied way of thinking, professional background, and family legacy all align into a coherent, particular psyche. Elise feels vivid through her encoded writings and the way Marina interprets them. The main weakness is limited on-page contradiction or struggle; Marina processes fear and inheritance with notable fluency, so the internal conflict feels largely resolved rather than contested. The final realization is emotionally apt but not deeply earned through competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives are clear and specific—an ache around her erased mother, a pull toward the sphere—and her choices (disobeying the tide master, using the flowers, stepping through the door) all grow credibly from that core. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with tactile anchors like flint-calloused hands and hidden books. There’s some internal tension (obedience vs compulsion) but less in-the-moment contradiction under peak pressure than would fully maximize the arc. The mother reads as vivid through remembered and recovered images even with minimal on-page presence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, worldview, and motivation are clear and particular, and her process—“mapping silence”—feels grounded in character rather than generic magic. However, she faces little internal friction: there’s no real doubt, temptation, or contradictory impulse on the page, which makes her feel slightly idealized. The cost of her choice is mostly physical fatigue, sketched rather than deeply felt. A touch more ambivalence about altering fate itself could deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Both narrator and Voss feel specific and consistent, with clear motives (curiosity, legacy) conveyed through concrete behaviors like listening to the building and tending the garden. However, internal contradiction and real on-page struggle are muted; the narrator largely acquiesces to the role rather than wrestling with it. The emotional cost is present but underplayed, particularly around Voss’s fading. This keeps the piece just shy of the most searching literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mirabel’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—from skeptic to someone willing to sacrifice her own memories to restore her sister’s. Her isolation-into-independence arc is credible and the final stance (“no longer waiting to be remembered”) feels earned. Internal conflict (skepticism vs hope, bitterness vs love) is present but could be sharpened with one or two more concrete, contradictory impulses in the live scene rather than in summary. Elena is mostly an off-page force, so the relationship pressure is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veren’s motivation—decades of guilt over Aldric and a vocational ethos of preservation through forgery—is specific, consistent, and clearly drives his choice. His interiority is textured (knowledge of Aldric’s handwriting, memories of the assassination) without lapsing into abstract label-speak. The internal conflict between “treason” and “completion” is present but could be dramatized more sharply in-scene rather than mostly asserted as settled. The final act of self-forgiveness is credibly earned by the setup and feels like a meaningful internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s drive, perception, and history with her mother create a clear, specific interior life, and her final renunciation of song feels earned by what we’ve seen. The cost of that choice—losing a defining part of herself—is legible and character-rooted. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real time; we don’t see competing impulses wrestle on the page so much as we’re told the conclusions. The elders and mother remain offstage abstractions rather than present relational crucibles, which limits the complexity of her emotional field.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, ethics, and empathy are clear and specific, and her interiority is textured (“The truth was a knife, and Mira had to decide where to cut”). However, her internal conflict around exposing the harbormaster’s father is relatively low-friction; there’s little sense of personal risk or genuine temptation to hold back. The final resolve to tell the council feels thematically right but emotionally easy. Strong, but not yet at the level of deeply conflicted, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mirelle is specific, vivid, and coherent: the “net-mender philosopher” whose habits (tracking fireflies for seventeen years, embedding patterns in nets, carrying the whisk) all align tightly with her worldview. Motivation—to witness and honor hidden effort—is clear and consistently dramatized. What’s missing at this level is real internal contradiction or cost on the page; she’s almost serenely self-possessed, with little sense that her choices ever genuinely trouble or endanger her. The endurance at the end reads as graceful but low-stress, which keeps the character work strong rather than extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s motivation as a compulsive truth-seeker is clear and consistently enacted through concrete investigative behavior (reassembling letters, following the Geiger counter, deciding to take the diamond). Interiority is specific enough to feel grounded, especially her reaction to Consortium lies, but there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure. Her choice to leave with the diamond feels earned but not deeply anguished; the cost is mostly conceptual rather than emotionally dramatized. Overall she reads as competent and particular, but not yet fully three-dimensional at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miriam’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: a “lonely visionary” who never wanted followers yet understands the power and danger of belief. Her decision to offer doubt instead of blessing is fully motivated by her history with Caro and her relationship to the ancient signals. Interiority is concrete and particular rather than generic (“woman made of weather and regret,” the re-framing of loneliness). Caro is thinner but functional as a pressure source rather than a fully realized co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motives are clear and particular—his exile, his hunger for purpose, his fixation on discarded sounds—and his actions align with that psychology. Interiority is concrete in places (“grief made small enough to carry”), but contradictory impulses under pressure are underdeveloped; nothing truly strains his values on the page. The decisive “choice” to continue this work feels more like a confirmation than a hard-won turn. The absence of the old man on the page also removes a potential crucible for Marcus’s flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect the Source Tone from commodification—even as she reinterprets “protection” into self-sacrificial release, and that shift feels earned. The “logically emotional” trait is stated and partially dramatized in how she processes the Consortium’s threat, though it leans a bit on label rather than fully embodied contradiction. Her final choice is in character for someone who has spent her life “protecting light and warning ships of danger,” giving the ending emotional plausibility. The lack of any on-page relational crucible slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific—atoning for past impulsiveness through an almost ascetic patience—and that tension between old fire and new restraint runs credibly through the piece. Her backstory with the brother is efficiently tied to her present choices, and details like “sculpt patience from impatience” and the way she listens to the ice make her feel particular, not generic. The internal change is more a consolidation than a sharp turn, but it reads earned. I’d push for more in-the-moment conflict (a present temptation to act too soon) to fully maximize pressure on her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret is sharply sketched as a rational, methodical professional whose ethical drive and residual fear coexist credibly, especially in her decision to document and later expose the smuggling. Her role as “preventable death investigator” integrates nicely with her guilt over David and her refusal to accept “some deaths simply couldn’t be prevented.” Interiority is grounded in sensory experience (the wall, the lantern) and professional habits, though some phrasing (“fortified vulnerability,” therapist language) edges toward abstract/therapy-speak. Her final choice feels motivated and earned, but her internal conflict could involve more genuine risk-temptation or self-deception on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Father Marcus’s guilt, vocation, and need to “deserve” forgiveness are cleanly motivated and specific, and his interiority feels grounded in lived contradiction (chaplain vs. witness who lied). Ruth is sketched efficiently but with clear values (precision, respect for time, quiet empathy) that shape her responses. The relationship dynamic—confessor seeking a kind of absolution from a craftsperson—creates a subtle but effective status inversion. The only weakness is that Marcus’s shift toward action is a touch smooth, with little resistance on the page beyond stated remorse.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zephyr’s personality is vivid—wry, reckless, and intellectually hungry—and her motivation to reach the bell is clearly rooted in that “aggressive curiosity.” However, she faces little genuine internal friction; the risk of dissolution is treated as “absolutely hilarious,” which flattens the sense of emotional cost at the decision point. The Boiler functions as a useful foil but only lightly pressures her. The final choice to launch is consistent and earned, but not deeply torqued by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Helena’s curiosity and obsession are well-motivated and specific to her role; her “brightly attentive” pattern-recognition credibly drives every choice. Emotional embodiment is present but somewhat muted—her fear, guilt, or moral conflict around violating security and disturbing the dead could be pushed further. The link to Marcus through shared obsession with what persists (space, data) works nicely but remains conceptual more than deeply felt. The final decision to leave the silo and pursue Marcus is earned, but the personal cost is implied rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kira’s self-erasing empathy, embodied in the "shadows" she carries, is specific and consistent, and her shift toward including herself in her own circle of care is earned by the mirrors’ revelations. However, the internal conflict is more stated than dramatized—her belief that she deserves no compassion is articulated by the keeper rather than surfaced through her own contradictory impulses in action. The relationship with the lighthouse keeper is functional but relatively one-note (he is more oracle than person), so the crucible of interaction is limited. Still, her choices and emotional arc feel coherent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s inner life is specific, coherent, and rooted in concrete particulars (the stroke, Zurich appointment, parasol, volunteering), and her ambivalence about death vs. continued living feels credibly unresolved. The shift from seeking an “end” to inhabiting “waiting as living” is well-earned by prior beats. Emotional states are embodied through sensory and environmental perception rather than labels. The only mild limitation is the near-total absence of relational friction on the page; Captain Elise functions more as chorus than as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is sharply drawn—a man of endurance and quiet regret—and Sofia’s purpose and temperament are legible, though less layered. His choice to keep the fragment and to meet her at all are well-motivated. Internal conflict (loyalty to the past vs. willingness to speak) is present but could be more acutely dramatized in-scene. The final stance—accepting the role of witness rather than would-be lover—lands, but with gentle rather than searing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line walker’s motives and methods are clear and particular, and her profession-specific sensibility (peripheral awareness, balance mask) gives her a distinct inner life. However, her internal conflict feels muted: she never seriously doubts, falters, or pays much visible emotional price beyond weary competence. The keeper has a touching, specific stake but remains lightly sketched, and the prophet is almost purely symbolic. The final endurance/renunciation (walking away after saving the voices) reads earned but emotionally low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s vocation, temperament, and belief in reshaping grief are clear and consistent, and her actions (inviting villagers, assembling the mosaic) follow credibly from them. However, she remains mostly emblematic rather than fully human—there’s little embodied interior conflict or contradiction on the page. We’re told she is “perceptively calm,” but we never see that calm fray, cost her anything, or conflict with a more chaotic impulse. Secondary characters are vivid in snapshot but don’t apply direct, immediate pressure back onto Maren herself.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s characterization as a withdrawn, obsessive linguist is vivid and consistent, and her refusal to evacuate is well-motivated by her fascination with the crystal and grief over language’s “death.” Her interiority is concrete (lexicons, growth rings, botanical studies) rather than generic. However, her internal conflict is soft: we don’t see strong, simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene so much as a settled stance, which slightly limits the felt cost of her choice to stay. The final endurance feels credible and earned, but emotionally it remains more contemplative than pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, and his compulsion to find “something” before the fog lifts cleanly motivates every on-page choice. The “precognitively forgetful” flaw is dramatized rather than labeled, especially in the chalk-writing fugue and the futile photograph. The final acceptance that forgetting is mercy feels earned by the earlier grief at familiarity and the funeral memory. The main limitation is that internal contradiction (resisting vs needing the visions) is more implied than actively dramatized in moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s grief and longing are specific and embodied, and Yua’s blend of gentleness and almost ritualistic precision feels lived-in rather than archetypal. The father’s motives are clearly rooted in his temperament and belief, and Mira’s final choice to stay reads as an earned shift in her relationship to loss. Internal contradiction is present (Mira wants repair but must accept stillness), though it could be shaded with slightly more irrational resistance in the middle. The characters skirt mythic archetype without collapsing into types, but a hint more mess or flaw in Yua would deepen the crucible between them.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira and Samuel are sharply etched in a small space, with Mira’s “decisively kind” presence and Samuel’s terror/nostalgia combination driving believable micro-choices (agreeing to the song, then to the record repair). Emotional states are mostly embodied and specific (“his hands trembled,” shoulders hunched, the tactile work of gluing shards). The internal conflict—terror versus the desire for a “flawless goodbye”—is credible and present on the page, though it remains relatively idealized and tidy. The final stance (turning together to face the results) feels earned by the prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s goal and motivation are clear and consistent, and her competence with uncertainty (a novice forced into expert work) is well-drawn. However, her interior conflict is muted; we don’t see much simultaneous doubt and drive beyond a few lines about being “barely a budding rune scholar.” Her emotional reactions to huge revelations (light itself changing, shadows fleeing reality) remain slightly under-embodied and calm. The relationship to the grandmother and to the automaton functions but doesn’t come under real interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s internal conflict between trained skepticism and inherited belief is clear, embodied, and motivates every major action, from exhuming the grave to deciding on a new vocation of study. Her professional identity as a doctor meaningfully colors how she reads bones and evidence. The final choice to reorient her life toward finding Charlotte and documenting changelings feels earned by the prior tension. A minor weakness is that her flaws (e.g., the ways skepticism has harmed her relationships) are more told than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren is sharply realized: an aging gem polisher, bereaved mother, and “earthbound star watcher” whose habits and tools all grow from the same wound. Her motives—returning to the grotto, polishing glass, refusing fire—are coherent and specific, and her small choices in the scene (what to polish, how to arrange it, whether to imagine others) feel earned. The grief is embodied through setting and action more than labels, and the quiet shift toward communal imagination at the end reads as an earned endurance rather than a neat cure. Internal contradiction (clinging to memories yet transforming them) is present, though it could be pushed a shade harder in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is sharply drawn as observant, reticent, and quietly driven, with her attention to moss and patterns convincingly tied to how she processes grief. Thea is sketched efficiently through her off-page confession and on-page hesitation at the entrance. The core choice—to offer the pendant nonverbally—is well motivated by Mira’s temperament and history with her mother. Internal contradiction (resentment vs care) is present but could be made a shade more acute in-scene to fully exploit the relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena is sharply characterized: a blocked novelist whose avoidance, grief, and perfectionism all feed her central fear of hope, with the grandmother/shell backstory deepening motive. Her micro-choices in the nexus—engaging the abandoned characters, choosing to name hopes, finally vowing to finish—track cleanly and reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction (needing hope to write vs. fearing it) is credible and resolved with cost. Secondary figures are sketched but effective as pressure rather than people in their own right, which fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive and vocation are clear and nicely fused: an anxious, mathematically minded tinkerer trying to repair cultural loss through her craft. Her embodied reactions with the tendril and her self-consciousness about not being “musical” give her specificity. Internal conflict is present (insecurity vs. responsibility) but remains low-grade; we don’t see a genuinely dangerous or compromising choice. The ending hints at a future arc (teaching others) but the cost of that commitment is not deeply felt yet.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s vocation, temperament, and long-haul dedication are sharply realized, especially in the physicalized patience (“Each placement took minutes, sometimes longer”). Her motivation—to make maps from heartbeats so souls can return to themselves—feels specific and coherent with her actions. However, she faces almost no on-page resistance or internal contradiction in the scene, so her complexity is more implied than dramatized. The final stance (quiet satisfaction and moving on) is credible but low-cost in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elena’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her history (“to capture mystery without killing it”), and her locksmith mentality colors how she approaches everything. Her competence is well balanced by a quiet vulnerability to awe, especially in the harvest scene. Internal conflict is present but subtle—her desire to understand vs. preserve wonder—which suits the piece but keeps the arc somewhat muted. The final endurance/renunciation (keeping the echoes as notes and memory, not domination) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—needing others’ burdens to anchor her own fractals—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. The internal state of being “boundary-lessly trapped” is embodied in concrete images (patterns invading thoughts) rather than labels. Her change at the end (regaining her name and edges) feels earned by the night of work and the cost of taking on others’ sorrows. The only limiter is that her contradictory impulses (ethics of using others’ grief vs self-preservation) are more implied than directly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marguerite’s grief, habits, and motivations are specific and coherent—her choice to carve lions and teach others is credibly rooted in her history with Viktor. Embodied details (joint pain, the feel of ash wood, smell of sawdust) ground her interiority. The piece lacks a strong on-page internal contradiction or pressured choice; her stance is more affirmed than challenged. That soft pressure keeps this from feeling fully transformative, but the characterization is still rich and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s inner conflict between survival-driven pragmatism and eroded artistic ambition is specific and convincing, especially in her refusal to turn to the ghost at first and her eventual choice to face it. The ghost-as-younger-self dynamic gives the relationship real pressure and clear status shifts (“That’s all I wanted to hear.”). Her final stance—owning that she was that ambitious person without reverting to her—feels earned and costs her the self-protective lie. A touch more embodied, non-metaphorical emotion at peak beats could deepen her further.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is clearly drawn as a displaced, intellectually tenacious engineer whose habits of mind shape every choice she makes in the terminal. Her motivation—to find a way to resurrect the spaceport and, by extension, humanity’s reach—is consistent and legible. However, her emotional life stays mostly in one register of quiet resolve, with limited contradictory impulses or visible inner conflict under pressure. The final decision to present to the city council feels earned but low-cost, more an extension of what we already know than a fraught turn.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in occupation, habit, and sensory focus; the link between her clock-scribing, introversion, and sublimated musicianship feels fully inhabited. Her motivations (solitude, duty, fear of the noise-plague, longing for music) are clear and cohere into a credible internal conflict. The realization that her “decorative flourishes” are music and her choice to begin composing again are well-motivated by prior detail. The main limitation is that her resistance to hope remains mostly conceptual; the decision comes smoothly, with relatively little on-page struggle in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is specific and convincing, with her father’s mythology and her compulsive truth-seeking clearly motivating each action, especially the choice to dive into his final secret rather than turn away. The contradiction between her lingering love and her ruthless analytic instinct is present without being over-explained. Her emotional shift at the end—accepting clarity at the cost of comfort—feels earned by prior beats. Relationship pressure is one-sided (the father is off-page) but still functions as the core crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motive—to preserve endangered, embodied knowledge—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, from collecting seeds to decoding the rope to deciding to seek the weavers. Her interiority is textured (the fulgurite association, the philosophy of seeds/knots) and grounded in concrete perception. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or inner conflict; she’s almost entirely competent and aligned with her goal, so the final commitment feels deepening rather than pressured or costly. A touch more ambivalence or risk around following the invitation would sharpen character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s vocation, history with Matthias, and present-moment aims interlock cleanly, and her choice to write her own obituary in this ruined garden feels fully motivated by the brother’s death and her long practice. Her interiority is specific (stones from every country, the sparrow, the bread) and embodied (cold seeping through clothes, the thread cutting a groove), avoiding stock grief language. The internal contradiction—someone expert at mapping others’ grief but lost in her own—is clear, though it could surface with a bit more on-page resistance or self-sabotage under pressure. The final endurance choice (to carry absence as precious and move on) is earned and carries perceptible cost without being over-tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aldric’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistent—from disgust with “scheduled contentment” to risking everything on Resonance Reconstruction. Interiority is rich and embodied (filth, sleeplessness, obsession) rather than generic. The internal conflict between grieving the lost past and accepting an imperfect new life is present but could be sharpened under direct pressure at the moment he activates the device. The final emotional shift to joyful acceptance feels earned and carries a credible cost (he can’t get the old world back).

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—fighting fires as a response to her father’s arson—is clear, specific, and carries through to her present ritual with the sand and sculpture. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt in her teeth, in the healed burns on her forearms”), and the contradiction between her legacy and vocation is well dramatized. The father and grandmother exist only in recollection but still shape her micro-choices, especially the silent photo she once sent and her use of the coin. The final realization about containing rather than extinguishing fire feels earned by her history, though it borders on tidy insight.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s core traits—skeptical, luminous, realistically imaginative—are clearly established and consistently reflected in her choices, especially in how she interrogates the crystals even as she follows the trail. Her motivation to restore the memory wells and protect the city’s last free memory is legible and coherent throughout. The sacrifice of her mother’s laughter is emotionally effective, though her internal conflict at that moment could be rendered with a bit more contradictory texture. Overall, she feels distinct and grounded, but there’s still room for more messiness or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veloris’s role as an “otherworldly sentimentalist” is specific and consistent, and her choice to activate the gear and then move on with fragile hope feels earned from the accumulated watching and sorrow. Motivation (to interrupt destructive generational patterns) is clear and rooted in her long history, though internal conflict is more stated than dramatized and she encounters no meaningful resistance. We see values through her micro-choices—pausing her transit, investigating the gear, deciding to leave it behind—but they aren’t pushed into contradiction on the page. The ending’s shift to “something resembling hope” works but could be even stronger if her doubts or costs were more embodied earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s craft-driven motivation and family context are vivid and specific, and her shift from individual to collective grief feels earned by the scene with Thomas. Her interiority is concrete (the breathing, the notepad, the ribbons) rather than abstract. The relationship with Thomas has clear status dynamics—she challenges him but ultimately takes in his guidance. The main limitation is that we glimpse relatively little contradiction or real internal friction around her calling; she reads almost serenely competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s guilt, professional rigor, and refusal to grant herself forgiveness are rendered with specific, embodied detail (the climb, the counting, the nightly ritual) and drive every choice she makes. Her ethical diligence both sustains her penance and prevents easy absolution, which gives the final lightening of the “seventeen seconds” real cost. Internal contradiction is present—she both clings to punishment and seeks some form of balance—but it stays quiet and controlled rather than erupting into overt struggle. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that her inner conflict resolves with relative smoothness once the rake handle is introduced, rather than being tested in a more contested way on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is vivid, with her cemetery work, gardener’s hands, and blithe acceptance of death grounding her motives and skills. Her choice to patiently decode the tapestry flows cleanly from that characterization. However, internal conflict is very mild—she’s “unsettled” but never truly strained—so the final acceptance carries limited felt cost. The relationship with the grandmother is emotionally under-pressured on the page, more idea than live crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation and philosophy (“ignorance cartographer”) create a distinctive, consistent psyche, and her terror vs. duty around the commission is clearly motivated. Her micro-choices (delaying picking up the quill, returning to the window, choosing “invitation” over “prophecy”) are coherent and reveal values. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-voltage; she never feels on the verge of a genuinely bad or self-deceptive choice, which blunts the cost of her eventual stance. Still, the final humility is earned by prior setup and reads as a credible, if quiet, reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Helena’s motives and worldview are clear and particular—her past as a copyist credibly informs both her compulsion to preserve stories and her tactic of encoding messages in symphonic fragments. Interiority is concrete (“thistled calm,” peace with thorns) rather than generic, and her small on-page choices (timing the broadcast with the mist, continuing despite fear at the outside noise) align with that core drive. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—her acceptance of isolation versus her need to connect—and the ending reads as an earned continuation rather than a significant change, which modestly limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—her handling of the mask and ashes, her desire to “crystallize this fleeting emotion,” and her acceptance of inheriting the work all feel credible and rooted in character. The grief is textured rather than generic, with a clear hierarchy of values (honesty over comforting lies). Internal contradiction is present but gentle: she longs to keep emotion while knowing she cannot. The final Earned Stasis—choosing to sit in the rocking chair and continue the role—is well motivated by earlier reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is sharply etched: his “rationally rebellious” stance, comfort with contradiction, and archivist habits all cohere into a distinct psychology. His central conflict—engage the zealots vs. preserve in secrecy—is clear and credible, though the emotional cost of that choice stays more stated than viscerally felt. The endurance/renunciation at the end (choosing preservation over confrontation) is earned but underplayed on the body level. Strong interiority, lightly abstracted, keeps him from quite reaching the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margaret is sharply realized—her resignation, grief over vanishing traditions, and vocational identity all anchor clear, consistent motivations, and Darius’s arc from rage to tentative re-engagement is credible. The relationship dynamic (teacher/former student, both altered by loss) is strong and specific. Internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in explicit push-pull beats, so her shift from resignation to renewed teaching feels deep but a bit too smooth. Still, micro-choices (choosing the library, lifting the zither, adjusting his hands) effectively reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect and revive forbidden memory-foods—and her actions (guarding the seed for years, risking the regime’s wrath) align well with that drive. Her sensory interiority around tasting memories is vivid and character-specific. However, her emotional life under pressure is relatively one-note (resolute, reverent); there’s limited contradiction or real-time inner conflict as she chooses revolution over safety. That slight lack of ambivalence or moral friction keeps the characterization just short of top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and the woman are cleanly sketched with distinct motives, and Mira’s compulsion toward truth plus her attachment to her mother’s legacy feel specific. Her key choices—to speak, to reveal the secret of the tower, to help—are motivated and coherent. Emotional states are mostly implied through action and image rather than label. The main limitation is that Mira’s internal conflict and any cost to her revelations remain relatively soft, keeping the arc from feeling fully crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s sensibility as a “creeping normality noticer” is vivid and consistent, and her behavior—moving objects, walking abandoned houses, carrying the shard—flows cleanly from that trait. The realization about attention vs. objects is well-motivated by her experiment in the Whitmore house. However, her internal conflict is relatively mild; she doesn’t seem genuinely torn or tested so much as confirmed. The cost of her final stance (bearing the burden of endless witnessing) is present but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s grief-driven certainty and its gradual cracking are well-motivated, and Veris’s patient, precise empathy feels particular rather than generic. The use of telepathy to show Mira’s panic and defensive certainty is effective, and her micro-choice to project “Thank you” back at Veris nicely crystallizes her shift. The internal conflict could feel richer if Mira resisted or interrogated the revelations more instead of moving relatively smoothly toward acceptance. The brother remains more a vector of ideas than a fully individuated presence, but that’s acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s inner life is specific and textured—“grim optimist” borne out in her persistence, her mathematical framing of emotion, and the backstory with her father’s call. Her motivation (to capture the texture of a missed opportunity) coheres cleanly with her behavior on the staircase. Internal contradiction (hope vs. grief, caution vs. risk) is present but could be dramatized a bit more in the peak moment instead of having her “not hesitate.” Still, the final endurance on a new, slightly warmer staircase reads as an earned stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s grief, insomnia, and methodical hope are clearly motivated and embodied (her late-night painting, two-year search, and tears at the email all feel specific and earned). The internal shift from seeing insomnia as punishment to gift reads credibly rooted in her experience. The piece is more about deepening a stable character than exposing sharp contradictions, so we don’t see strong simultaneous opposing impulses in-scene. Still, actions consistently align with motives and reveal a coherent, particular person.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is sharply drawn: an ex-museum guide turned cave educator whose concrete choices (teaching letters, bread, pigments) consistently reflect her values. Her motivation—to preserve culture under erasure—is clear and embodied rather than simply labeled. Internal conflict between fading hope (beekeeper, honey) and stubborn duty is present but remains relatively understated, so her endurance at the end, while credible, could feel even more acute with one sharper moment of doubt or failure. Still, for this length, her interiority and actions align well and feel particular.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric’s grief-driven motivation is vivid and coherent, especially once his daughter’s death is revealed, and his backward-clock obsession nicely embodies his flaw. However, his internal conflict is relatively one-note—he never truly hesitates or questions the cost of stepping through, so contradictory impulses are muted. Interiority is specific (“time could be unwound like thread from a spool”) and character-particular, but we don’t quite get a sharp, in-the-moment struggle at the climax. The final choice feels motivated and earned, but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s motivation—to be rid of the fear lodged in her chest—is clear and specific, and the advisor’s predatory benevolence is sharply drawn. Her emotional state is well embodied (“nested in her chest like a living thing”), but we see relatively little in-the-moment ambivalence once she accepts the advisor’s terms. The internal conflict at the climax (in the dream) is summarized rather than fully dramatized, so her transformation, while credible, feels slightly under-struggled on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet is strongly, specifically rendered—her history with clouds, the inherited mallet, and her long practice of transforming wreckage all feel lived-in and coherent. Motivation is clear and credible: she reads, interprets, and repurposes, with her micro-choices (how to strike the hull, when to pause and read the sky) aligned to that drive. What’s missing at this tier is real internal friction or contradiction under pressure; she never feels genuinely torn or taxed by a difficult choice. The closing stance is essentially a serene continuation rather than a change with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to know rather than merely endure dread—is specific, consistent, and organically escalates from observation to decisive action. Her years of mapping, secret decoding of her father’s message, and hidden boat all track with a quietly obsessive temperament. The internal conflict between safety and the need to understand is present if understated, and her final choice to leave feels earned. A slightly sharper on-page clash between attachment to the city and drive to depart could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s motivations are clear and specific (exposed the Institute, erased, continuing her mentor’s work), and her internal conflict between valuing the Institute’s good works and her commitment to truth is credibly dramatized in the “burn it vs expose it” beat. Interiority feels character-particular for an academic exile and remains consistent. The label “emotionally rational” is a bit on-the-nose, and some ethical reasoning is narrated in thesis form rather than fully embodied, which slightly blunts complexity. Her final choice to publish is well earned by prior pages but could carry a sharper felt personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina is vivid—a meticulous, solitary figure whose vocation and avocation align in a convincing way, and her ritualized behavior with artifacts feels specific to her. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or genuine dilemma; her “choice” at the end is largely to continue as she has been. The emotional profile trends steady (reverent, quietly impassioned) rather than evolving under pressure, which slightly flattens her arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s characterization as a tranquil, hyper-perceptive indexer is specific, consistent, and strongly tied to her choices (following sounds in the blackout, reading the ledger, revising the record). Her motivation—tracing honest origins—is clear and carries through to the final act of stamping the new entry. The internal shift from solitude-as-absence to solitude-as-presence is credible and earned, though her emotional life skews more composed than conflicted. A touch more visible contradiction or cost in her calmness under pressure could deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistent—every choice flows cleanly from her refusal to release her daughter, from folding cranes to smuggling crystal. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (“her heart begged for stillness”), though the final emotional shift toward peace happens a bit quickly and neatly for the depth of loss presented. Contradictory impulses (clinging vs. letting the shadow depart) are implied but not deeply dramatized in on-page micro-choices. The mother–daughter relationship is powerful but almost entirely idealized, with little complexity beyond grief.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Yara’s interiority is specific, embodied, and rooted in concrete memories (veil, rubble, ash), and her drive to study “unused potential” reads as a psychologically credible transmutation of trauma. The distinction she draws between survivor’s guilt and “incompleteness” is character-particular and strong. Internal contradiction exists (bleak exhilaration vs. persistent grief), though it doesn’t quite crystallize into a sharp on-page choice beyond continued endurance. The closure is more an earned stasis than a decisive change, which slightly limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (father, anomalies, belonging) is clear and her choices—launching the drone, interpreting the signal, choosing continuation over closure—track well with that. Her interiority is specific enough to feel individual, especially in the “perpetually surprised” lens on the sky, though that trait never quite complicates her choices. The pilgrim is thinner but functional as a foil and catalyst. The final handoff of both chips to Mira is motivated and implies cost, but her internal conflict at that moment could be more sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s guilt, professional pride, and self-justification are well integrated, and the flashback to Elise Varen cleanly motivates her current torment. The internal conflict between “liberator” self-image and complicity in harm is specific and character-particular rather than generic. Her decision to reverse her skills and seek the girl’s family feels earned, with visible emotional cost and no safety-hedging. A slightly authorial framing of her remorse (“tempered regret”) is the only element that feels labeled rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply drawn: competent, conflicted, and personally implicated, with clear professional ethics (“lopsided deals breed resentment”) and a visible struggle between familial love and professional detachment. Her interiority around her brother’s recklessness feels specific rather than generic, especially the unsent letters and delayed apology. The relationship stakes are credible, though the brother is more symbol than person on the page. The one explicit formulation of her motivation (“recycle her brother's mistakes into wisdom”) edges toward abstraction but is still supported by behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with her competence, guilt, and paralysis all feeding into the small but meaningful act of getting back on the water. Contradictory impulses coexist on the page—she sees the compass as punishment yet keeps carrying it; she can’t trust herself yet literally navigates. The final Earned Stasis choice (keep the broken compass, keep paddling) is well-motivated by prior regret and fear and carries a felt cost. A slight softness is that her “best on the circuit” competence is mostly told rather than tested in-scene, so we don’t see her struggle under live navigation pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and textured—the “phantom limb” of guilt, the way skills persist when memories do not—and his numbness vs. dawning responsibility conflict is credible. Elena’s motivation (honoring her brother’s values rather than her own anger) is clear and puts principled pressure on him. The final choice to step into the maze with the baseball in hand feels earned by what we’ve learned. Elena’s dialogue occasionally edges toward thesis-delivery, but it still tracks with her exhaustion and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s grief-driven motivation and three-year refusal make her final acceptance of metamorphosis feel earned and costly. The internal contradiction (“Terror and peace existed simultaneously…”) is specific and embodied rather than generic. The sibling relationship is sketched efficiently yet lands as the crucible for her choice. Kael is more emblem than complex character, but for this length his clarity as a beloved, lost brother works.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Morrigan’s motivation—to reclaim the lost, half-remembered years of early motherhood—is vivid, consistent, and drives every action on the page. Her interiority feels specific rather than generic (the bathroom breakdown, the sense of being “too newly-made” to hold time). Internal contradiction exists (desperate enough to risk this place, yet “willingly perplexed,” unsure whether it’s magic or madness), though it could sharpen further at the moment of unlocking the door. The mother–child relationship is powerful but largely recollected, with Iris herself mostly a symbol until the final paragraph, which slightly softens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mei Lin’s vocation, solitude, and engineered purpose create a specific, believable psychology, and her buried rage versus cultivated pacifism provides a clean internal contradiction. The key turn—choosing to admit her anger and do shadow work on herself—is well prepared by decades of compassionate labor for others. Emotions are mostly embodied in actions (floating, stitching, whispering to photos) rather than labels. A slight reliance on abstract framing (“shadow work,” “integrated darkness”) keeps her from feeling fully idiosyncratic rather than concept-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miriam’s motivation and history are vivid and specific—the “Saint of Ashford” turned destitute seeker is immediately compelling, and her desire to understand transformation is credibly rooted in her past. Her inner life feels particular rather than generic, especially in her relation to wealth as “walls” instead of windows. The main limitation is that the story leans more on articulated realization than on dramatized contradiction under pressure, so conflicting impulses in the present scene stay relatively muted. Still, her final stance—release over possession—reads as earned and carries a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s competence, vigilance, and quiet radicalism are clearly motivated and consistent, and her role as lock sentinel is tightly bound to her tactics. What’s missing at this level is more embodied, on-page tension—she moves through the coup with almost no felt fear, doubt, or internal contradiction. The final stance (remaining the unassuming sentinel while having lit the fuse) is earned but emotionally under-costed. A bit more friction between loyalty to her role and betrayal of the Duke would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Meren’s motives (avoidance vs promised responsibility) are clear and consistent, and her final choice to act feels earned by what we know of her evasiveness and her grandmother’s influence. The curse provides a genuine internal constraint, though her emotional struggle in the present scene is relatively smooth and could use a sharper, more embodied moment of hesitation. Interiority is specific and character-particular rather than generic. The key weakness is that her transition from reluctance to confident action happens quickly and with limited on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and particular, with her seven-year silence, refined anger, and ambivalence toward the envelope all cohering into a believable psychology. Her contradictory impulses—avoidance of the letter vs. need to know, self-protective silence vs. drive to speak—are active on the page and culminate in a credible choice to resume her work. The parental relationship is off-stage but sharply etched through her responses to their artifacts. The final decision feels earned and costly, not a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and distinctive—her philosophy/action fusion and the mechanical arm plus backstory give her specificity and coherence under pressure. However, she experiences little visible doubt or contradiction in the present scene, which flattens her internal conflict and makes her feel almost frictionlessly competent. Krell functions more as a symbolic antagonist than a fully realized character, with limited nuance beyond “velvet over iron.” The final outcome registers as an extension of her established drive rather than a costly, character-testing shift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid and particular—the molting of personalities, her constancy to the library and Ezra, and the coffee tin ritual all feel lived-in and psychologically coherent. Her love and loyalty are palpable, but internal contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized; she’s never forced into a hard on-page choice between safety, self-erasure, and staying. Ezra is compelling but a bit idealized, serving more as lodestar than fully pressured character. The ending offers an earned stasis (she will keep returning despite identity flux) with cost implied but not fully felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—grief-hardened waiting coupled with stubborn creativity—is clear and governs every choice from threading the film to weaponizing the piano. Her emotions are embodied through objects (clock, piano, projector) rather than abstract labels, and the years of waiting give the reunion believable weight. Internal conflict between endurance and fear of hope is present, though it could surface a bit more explicitly under peak pressure. The final softening of her “steely longing” feels earned by what’s come before.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Yara’s interiority is specific and textured, especially in the tension between her empirical training and inherited traditions (“empirical whimsy of her training warred with something deeper”). Her motivation—to safeguard cultural memory while distrusting unverified methods—is clear and consistently drives her micro-choices. The shift from verification to protecting the space for questioning feels earned by the dream sequence and her prior failed attempts to “wake” the seed. A slight limitation is that the emotional cost of possibly losing the culture could be embodied a bit more viscerally, beyond the largely contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei’s motives and emotional trajectory are clear and grounded in specific history, and the grandmother’s wordless desperation is powerfully implied through her eyes, hands, and the encoded lace. The reconciliation choice at the end feels earned by prior set-up, and the relationship dynamic with Mr. Tanaka is quietly convincing. However, Mei’s internal contradictions (resentment vs. longing) are more stated than dramatized in present-time micro-choices, which slightly softens the crucible feel of the key scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's internal conflict—scientific rigour versus the messiness of grief—is rendered with excellent specificity. Her "neutron star" lens consistently filters her perception of the greenhouse, creating a distinct intellectual signature. The shift from seeking "answers" to accepting "humility" is earned through the interaction with the specimen slides, though the final internal realization feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in the closing action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation to find meaning in survival is clear and drives the narrative focus. Her internal transition from dependent artist to autonomous creator is well-charted, though the epiphany relies heavily on an external coincidence rather than purely character-driven agency. The realization about her "commodity" status feels earned by the backstory, even if the method of discovery is convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is deeply rooted in backstory, and the shift from "fixing" to "accepting" creates a coherent arc. However, the "psychological" nature of the deafness functions more as a convenient setup than a constraint that forces difficult tactical choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ezra is a sympathetic anchor with a consistent internal state of weariness. His motivation ("inadvertently stubborn") drives the inciting choice effectively, though it is stated rather than dramatized before the event. The emotional arc toward "earned" exhaustion is coherent and touching.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira's motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("sullenness masked something more fragile") rather than demonstrated behavior. The relationship with Yusuf suffers from didactic dialogue where Mira lectures him on the story's themes rather than letting the connection emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.4)
    Mei-Lin functions as a plot device rather than a character with agency or risk; she possesses perfect knowledge and faces no internal friction. The interaction with the woman lacks genuine status dynamics or struggle, resolving instantly via a magical intervention that costs the protagonist nothing. The dialogue ("What are you?") reinforces the functional, RPG-like nature of the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s profession as a maze designer perfectly frames her internal landscape ("paths could betray you"), grounding the high-concept premise in specific, lived expertise. Her motivation to solve the retrocognitive trap is visceral, driven by the erasure of her daughter's memory, and the final choice to disintegrate feels earned by this specific desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira is competent and goal-driven, but she lacks internal conflict; her certainty is absolute from start to finish. The emotional crucible is outsourced to the scout, whose rapid conversion—shifting from duty to treason after two lines of dialogue—feels functionally convenient rather than psychologically earned. The "farmer's daughter" backstory provides motivation but functions more as a label than a source of complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina is a deeply realized focalizer whose synesthesia and profession integrate seamlessly with her emotional arc. The climax—realizing the sound of broken trust is her own innocent voice—is a devastating, character-defining discovery that reframes her relationship with the antagonist (her mother) without needing her presence. The emotional logic is precise and the cost is felt deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she is a competent archetype who executes a plan without hesitation or moral struggle. The backstory about her mother provides motivation but functions as summary rather than driving a difficult choice under pressure. The character feels idealized, lacking the flaws or friction required for deep engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s habit of theatrical narration effectively dramatizes her coping mechanism for isolation, giving her a distinct psychological texture. However, the emotional pivot from seventeen years of fear to "exhilaration" feels rushed, resolving the internal conflict without a dramatized struggle or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's phobias are listed rather than dramatized as active constraints in the moment. The antagonist's motivation is standard, and her sudden psychological collapse—confessing immediately upon being handed a seashell—lacks earned emotional progression or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is competent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful micro-choices; the "obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through complex tradeoffs. The physical cost (bleeding fingers) feels like a standard genre trope rather than a character-specific price paid for a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Unit-7’s interiority is rich and melancholic, successfully blending mechanical function with acquired consciousness. However, the protagonist’s actions feel somewhat inevitable rather than driven by a difficult, active choice under pressure; the robot acts more as a vessel for the loop than an agent wrestling with a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation and interiority are clear, but the central emotional shift—Theo's thawing mistrust—occurs too smoothly without sufficient on-page resistance or interpersonal friction. The "accusations" function more as backstory labels than active pressures in the scene, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Esther is characterized with depth; the "mended deception" creates authentic internal conflict between maintaining her legend and aiding her granddaughter. Elena functions primarily as a foil to trigger Esther's revelation, but their interaction drives a genuine emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear objective, but she lacks internal conflict or a hierarchy of values tested under pressure. Her journey is procedural—executing a plan without hesitation or significant obstacles—rather than dramatic. The "kinship with machines" trait is stated but operates smoothly without forcing a difficult trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or a counter-impulse to deepen her agency. The "invisible musician" identity feels slightly stock, and her obsession functions more as a plot device than a source of complex character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Cassandra’s motivation is seamlessly integrated with the high-concept premise; her decision to embrace "imperfection" as a survival strategy is a profound, character-specific choice. The internal conflict between her engineered nature (fault-tolerant) and her absolute vision drives the narrative to a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clearly defined, and his skeptic-yet-obsessive parsing of the radio tapes ("like scripture") effectively dramatizes his internal conflict. However, his emotional transition upon finding the bead feels slightly rushed, accepting the "ghost shift" narrative with a certainty that resolves his skepticism too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization is consistent and interiority is deep, but Maren functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophy than a dynamic agent. She lacks contradictory impulses acting in a dramatized moment; her "loosening grip" is a settled state rather than an active struggle, resulting in a static portrait without high-stakes micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on labeled traits ("mellow," "softly adaptive") rather than dramatized behaviors under pressure. The dialogue feels performative and therapeutic ("I'm looking at you like you're becoming") rather than a natural interaction between mother and teenager.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maren functions as a plot device rather than a character; she possesses a convenient supernatural ability that removes friction (reading burned paper) and faces no internal contradictions. Her journey is one of unimpeded acquisition, lacking the difficult choices or renunciations required to demonstrate agency or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mei Lin is a compelling protagonist whose transition from sleeper agent to fortune writer feels earned and distinct. Her motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is beautifully articulated and drives her final choice to unburden herself of the past.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus displays clear motivation and competence, and the dynamic with Elena drives the scene. However, the dialogue relies heavily on rhetorical questions and abstract philosophical statements ("Is it not simply a prison that calls itself safe?"), which reduces naturalism and makes the characters feel like thematic mouthpieces rather than people in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    Li Wei is a superbly realized protagonist whose internal landscape ("chronologically homesick") drives the narrative logic. Her motivation to transcend her trade and access a deeper resonance is felt in every action, culminating in a choice that feels inevitable and transformative. The epiphany is not just stated but dramatized through her physical interaction with the setting and the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concepts than a living character; her internal conflict is summarized through abstract labels ("content but incomplete") rather than dramatized. The emotional stakes are intellectual, leaving the "fractured timelines" as stated facts rather than felt burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is somewhat passive, arriving at the cavern to receive a cure rather than driving the change through active struggle or choice. The emotional numbness is established through summary and metaphors ("like frost") rather than dramatized behavior or difficult interactions. The breakthrough feels unearned, as it relies on an external guide and object rather than internal fortitude or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Character motivation is strong and centers the narrative, with Mira’s devotion to integrity clearly driving the scene. However, traits like "credibly curious" rely on expository labeling rather than dramatization through difficult choices. The internal shift from observer to witness is handled well, though the cost of her decision remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maren is defined by her role as a lantern broker, but this occupation remains ornamental and does not shape her tactical choices or the climax. Her "aromatic caution" is stated but offers negligible resistance to the central action, resulting in a protagonist who observes rather than decides under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus serves as a passive vehicle for the story's philosophy rather than a character with conflicting desires or agency. His internal state is conveyed through abstract labels ("terrible clarity," "impossible sweetness") rather than embodied emotion or specific micro-choices. The woman functions primarily as a prompt to elicit his exposition, lacking her own distinct agenda or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear internal motivation. The pivot relies on a convenient memory block ("Now she understood") rather than a pressurized on-page discovery, which slightly intellectualizes the emotional breakthrough. Her choice to change her playing style is earned, but the path there feels somewhat expository.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority is distinct and grounded in her trade, establishing a strong baseline. However, the climax relies on a received message ("You are not too far gone") rather than an active internal struggle, making the transformation feel therapeutically smoothed rather than earned through character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.0)
    Marina functions as a benevolent vehicle for the plot rather than a character under pressure; she faces no genuine dilemma, risk, or internal contradiction. Her "shrewdness" is a stated attribute that smooths obstacles (using records) rather than creating a difficult trade-off or moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Veren's desire for belonging is clear but resolved through summary rather than dramatized struggle or difficult tactical choices. Her internal arc culminates in an explicit realization ("Veren realized") rather than an earned emotional shift shown through action. Kael functions primarily as a plot device to initiate the search, lacking distinct agency beyond his helper role.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Miriam’s motivation creates a seamless bridge between her backstory as a fossil illustrator and her present magical quest. The specific cost of "borrowing tomorrows" is embodied and felt in the denouement, grounding the fantasy in genuine human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira's motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding "ambiguous loss" is well-defined. However, interiority often relies on diagnostic statements ("Ambiguous loss carved stranger wounds") rather than embodied experience, and the emotional resolution feels slightly processed through therapy-speak rather than raw reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maren is a consistent focalizer, but her internal life is conveyed through labeled emotions ("sense memory," "kindly methodical") rather than embodied struggle. The lack of contradictory impulses makes her arc feel linear and inevitable rather than earned through difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera's internal landscape is rendered with precision, balancing scientific rationality against the surreal onset of metamorphosis. The transition from resistance to acceptance is earned through her reflection on "stem forced to grow," grounding the shift in her established character traits. Her specific fear—not just of death, but of what she is becoming—adds necessary dimension to the transformation trope.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal state is clearly drawn, but the secondary character (Theo) functions primarily as a mirror rather than a distinct agent. The shared attribute ("wryly earnest") and emotion ("haggard awe") are applied as labels to both characters, making them feel like thematic vessels rather than individuated people. The connection between them is instant and convenient ("understanding crystallizing"), lacking the friction or negotiation of a genuine relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's internal arc is clear, moving from anxiety to acceptance, though the pivot from terror to liberation feels slightly rushed for the word count. The realization resolves the internal conflict neatly, but the "peaceful smile" at the end lacks the weight of a struggle fully fought on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by retrospective summary and innate ability ("reactive vision") rather than active choices made under pressure in the present. Emotional beats are narrated ("dignity of understanding") instead of dramatized in scene, rendering the character passive and the internal landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clara’s professional identity acts as a strong anchor, but her emotional reactions—particularly the reunion with a father lost for thirty years—feel overly composed and tidy. The internal conflict is resolved with a single word ("Dare") rather than a dramatized struggle, and the "invisible weight of fears" remains a metaphorical assertion rather than an embodied psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira's skepticism is stated ("wanted to dismiss this") but folds immediately upon seeing the magic, lacking dramatized resistance or struggle. Her transition from doubter to believer is swift and convenient, bypassing the potential for a deeper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.0)
    Vera's boredom is established via labels rather than restless action, and her pivotal persuasion of the others is summarized ("Whispers to Thessaly") rather than dramatized. However, the somatic detail of frequencies hurting her "ancient teeth" provides a moment of strong, embodied characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s characterization as the "unwitting accomplice" is distinct and compelling, driving the central conflict effectively. The distinction she draws—"He asked. I chose"—serves as a strong, character-defining micro-turn that earns her agency in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei is a vivid, consistent focalizer with specific, sensory interiority ("tastes of ash"). However, the lack of an on-page crucible or high-pressure choice limits the character work to a static portrait; her endurance is habitual rather than tested by a specific narrative complication.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, and the shift from hiding to active confrontation provides a solid arc. However, interiority often relies on summary metaphors ("swallowed grief") rather than embodied sensation, making the emotional texture feel somewhat monochromatic until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's internal epiphany relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I became a myth buster because I wanted control"), which flattens the emotional climax into a therapy session. While the shift from skeptic to believer is the goal, the resistance dissolves too cleanly, lacking the messy friction of a twenty-year habit being dismantled.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira is a capable protagonist with clear motivation, but her primary trait ("orderly intuitive") is established via label rather than dramatized through complex deduction. Her internal conflict regarding "dual allegiance" is stated in exposition ("pressed against her chest") but she picks a side immediately without visible hesitation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena is a distinct, contemplative focalizer whose internal landscape matches the story's hushed tone. The connection between her father's grief and her "purposeful curiosity" provides solid grounding, though the backstory feels slightly functional rather than complicating her present-moment choices. Her resignation at the end is well-earned by her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on the "magical disability" trope, granting the protagonist hyper-competence without internal conflict or flaws. Her nature as a "heartfelt artisan" is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and she exits the story exactly as she entered, paying no emotional or physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exemplary; Maren’s professional rigidity (“red pen bleeding”) is effectively juxtaposed with her personal voids, earning the choice to leave safety. The internal conflict—competence vs. lovability—drives the narrative logic without melodrama. Her motivation is strictly character-bound and intensifies under the pressure of the ice's timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence without internal dimension. She functions as a force of nature—perfect, patient, and unwavering—which suits the fable mode but fails the rubric’s requirement for internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult micro-choices. She faces no doubts and pays no personal price; her "patience" is a stated trait rather than a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s internal conflict between scientific ambition and reverence for the site is well-dramatized. The shift in motivation—from harnessing the ephemeral to witnessing it—is earned through her interaction with the dead explorer. However, her final reasoning ("not proof but testimony") feels more like a thematic assertion than a grounded character perspective, given she possesses a functioning device that could prove her case regardless of the memory inside.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s internal landscape is compelling, grounding the fantastical premise in the heavy, specific emotional cost of his father's legacy. His transition from passive victim of reputation to active agent of truth is well-earned, though the mechanism of his victory (speaking through the lattice) relies more on sudden metaphysical intuition than established character capability.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias functions primarily as a dutiful vessel for the backstory and ritual rather than a conflicted agent; his compliance is immediate, lacking a moment of doubt or struggle that would heighten the stakes. While his reverence is clear ("learned to love her presence"), the "lovingly venomous" dynamic is stated but not dramatized through physical risk or hesitation, leaving him somewhat passive in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.7)
    Meren is a distinct, consistent protagonist with a unique craft, but she lacks internal contradiction or hesitation. The choice to defy tradition feels pre-settled, and her competence is so absolute that the emotional weight of the climax is reduced; the "ordeal" of the labyrinth challenges the pilgrims but not the weaver herself.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character motivation shifts via "sudden clarity" rather than through pressurized struggle or contradictory impulses in scene. Mira's transition from skepticism to faith is diagnostic and smooth, lacking the friction or embodied cost required for high-band character work. The realization ("Now Mira understood...") is asserted by the narrator rather than earned by the protagonist's resistance or actions.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    Vera acts as a consistent focalizer for the premise, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She performs her ritual with perfect competence and alignment, facing no personal dilemma or "crucible" moment that would test her character.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's duality—feigning foolishness while conducting sharp espionage—is executed with consistent internal logic and voice. The distinction between her performed persona and her internal cunning drives the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Celeste’s internal arc—from avoidance to articulation—is compelling and well-motivated. The conflict between her guilt and her fear of the truth is palpable, though the pivotal realization relies on a sudden vision triggered by a prop rather than active psychological processing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s internal conflict—the translator’s burden of accuracy versus the human need for mercy—is dramatized exquisitely. The pivotal choice to mistranslate the warning about the boats demonstrates profound agency under pressure, earning the internal shift regarding her own trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivation is clear but the emotional arc lacks resistance; Mira transitions from spiritual hollowness to joy without facing a significant internal contradiction or paying a visible cost on the page. The "laugh" at the climax feels performed rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Margot’s arc from restorer to participant is compelling, driven by the integration of the grandfather’s backstory which effectively primes the final conceptual repricing. The internal conflict between precision and play is resolved with a distinct, character-specific renunciation of "expertise" for "wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies on functional archetypes (rogue scholar, skeptical recruit) with rapid, convenient alignment. Marcus’s charm is asserted rather than tested against genuine resistance, and Sofia’s conversion lacks emotional friction or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Minerva is distinct and fits the mythic tone, but she exists as a static portrait rather than a character making difficult choices under present pressure. Her "unstoppable" nature removes hesitation or internal conflict in the scene, leaving her agency largely historical rather than active in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is diamond-hard and clear, driving the narrative arc effectively. However, the protagonist lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; she functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a complex agent under pressure. The emotion, while described, feels somewhat performative ("wept without shame") rather than embodied through conflicting desires or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivations are deeply rooted in their shared history and professional identities, with the "arcane linguist" background actively shaping Maren's approach to emotional conflict. The internal contradiction—desiring connection while fearing rejection—is palpable and resolves through a vulnerable choice that feels earned. The dynamic shifts authentically from estrangement to tentative collaboration, driven by the specific "careful recklessness" trait shared by the siblings.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation and interiority are handled with sophistication; Mira's internal state—moving from trembling uncertainty to "dappled resolve"—feels earned. The connection between her profession (balancing floods) and the moral dilemma is an excellent integration of character and theme. The emotional arc is precise, though the grandmother's presence is stronger than Mira's own distinct personality until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's internal landscape is vivid, and the specific backstory of the pigeon scandal grounds her trauma effectively. The choice to confess feels earned by the preceding introspection and the meteorite's symbolism, creating a cohesive character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Wren is a distinct, lyrical focalizer whose internal landscape matches the surreal setting. Her agency is primarily internal—"intuiting" and "waiting"—which fits the story's dream logic but slightly dampens the tension of the inciting struggle. The realization of her own "featherly determination" feels earned through reflection, though her escape relies somewhat on telepathic synchronization with the father.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s internal state of isolation is rendered with specific, embodied detail (“hollow rituals,” “codes I haven't learned”). Her motivation to seek refuge drives the scene effectively. The connection with Theo is instantaneous and frictionless, lacking the wariness or negotiation that might have deepened the sense of earned intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s internal landscape is legible, but her emotional arc—from grief to "peace with not-finding"—moves too rapidly, greased by the convenient discovery of the seeds rather than deep internal pressure. The attribute "cheerful gloom" feels more like an imposed label than a fully embodied complexity, though her reaction to the geode attempts to ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina is competent and distinct, with a clear philosophy, but she lacks a genuine internal crucible. The narrative raises a potential conflict—manipulation versus art—but resolves it via exposition ("She felt like a gardener") rather than dramatized struggle. Her success feels inevitable, leaving her static.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Selene and Kira function as archetypes with perfectly aligned goals, lacking internal friction or contradictory impulses. Kira's acceptance of the life-altering "cost" is immediate and frictionless, making her "fledging" feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is a distinct, contemplative protagonist whose internal state matches the story's mood. However, her emotional journey feels slightly frictionless; the transition from grief to acceptance arrives via instant epiphany rather than struggle. The "wise hermit" archetype limits the potential for messier, more embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character interiority is vivid and specific; the firefighter background meaningfully informs his metaphors and movement without becoming a caricature. The shift from paralysis to acceptance is earned through the recontextualization of the box, showing a clear internal arc rooted in established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marina is defined primarily by the label "physicist," yet her central action—divining a doctor’s name and city from a triangle of glass beads—undercuts this identity with inexplicable mysticism. The narrative asserts she is logical but dramatizes a convenient magical intuition that lacks the rigor or struggle implied by her profession. Motivation is clear, but the internal conflict is smoothed over by the ease of the magical solution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mira is defined by her profession and an explicitly stated desire ("to discover what walls dream about") rather than dramatized internal conflict. The attribute "sensitively perceptive" is applied as a label to explain her belief system rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or trade-off. She faces no genuine opposition or character-testing dilemma; her journey is one of affirmation rather than transformation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence without internal conflict or flaws. She performs her task with "perceptive calm" and "grace," facing no resistance, doubt, or difficult choices on the page. The "borrowed heartbeat" cost is paid by a backstory character, leaving the protagonist with no skin in the game.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara's internal landscape of professional exhaustion and persistent duty is rendered with specific, embodied detail ("clipboard... like armor"). Her worldview is coherent and drives the narrative, though the generals feel slightly archetypal and their dialogue overly symmetrical ("My son..."/"My daughter..."), which flattens the interpersonal texture slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Eleanor is a compelling contradiction, though her "amoral" nature is established largely through expository summary rather than present-scene action. The physical detail of "trembling hands" at the end effectively grounds her internal conflict in the body. The transition from ruthless calculator to sentimental preservationist feels slightly abrupt but is earned by the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Meridia is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but her internal journey lacks friction on the page. The transition from "Untouched Muse" to vessel of ancestral power feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choice or struggle against genuine resistance. The interiority relies slightly on abstract labels ("boundaries were not weakness but architecture") rather than visceral, embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character motivations are clearly delineated and the dynamic feels lived-in. Vera’s shift from serenity to tears is rapid but justified by the release of tension in the “hush.” Marcus’s internal conflict between beauty and truth drives the narrative naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Vera's motivation is clear and drives the action, and the specific choice to risk the heirloom wing adds necessary weight. However, her internal state relies on slightly performative literary markers ("wept without sound," "relic of grief") rather than idiosyncratic, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elin's interiority effectively links her craft to her grief, grounding the magic in character-specific logic. However, the emotional resolution feels eased by the ritual's immediate success; the internal "letting go" is presented as a realization during the process rather than a difficult choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the directive and visions rather than an active agent making difficult choices. Her motivation is an abstract "tug of purpose" and adherence to instructions ("break the seal"), which flattens the potential for internal conflict. While the backstory of phantom lives adds texture, her present-action agency is limited to compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivation is well-defined and drives the solitary action effectively. The internal distinction between "parsimony" and "truth" creates a solid intellectual interiority. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat insulated; the struggle is retrospective rather than visceral in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.7)
    Thorne functions primarily as a vessel for the thematic payload rather than a fully realized agent; his transition from murderous rage to weeping release is catalyzed almost entirely by Mireva's magical intervention rather than internal choice. Mireva's descriptor as a "scheming pacifist" is told via label rather than dramatized through cunning action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's obsession is efficiently established, and her pivotal choice to "breathe against" the fog marks a clear, agency-driven turn that recontextualizes her goal from capture to connection. The "seventeen years" sleeplessness acts more as a fable-like label than an embodied physical state, but her internal shift is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira's internal drive to preserve the craft is clear and grounded, but Petra relies on stock "feisty" cues (sharp elbows, sass) rather than nuanced agency. The relationship dynamic feels familiar and low-stakes, leaning on standard banter ("Respect your elders") rather than specific, pressure-driven interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maren is distinct but largely passive; she observes the orchard, follows instructions found in a note, and receives an epiphany rather than earning it through struggle. While her shift from bewilderment to acceptance is clear, the internal conflict is mild, and her motivation ("chasing forbidden knowledge") is stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The "brightened disquiet" describes her state but does not manifest as resistance or contradictory impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear goal, but her internal landscape is relatively static. She overcomes the central obstacle with immediate confidence and a convenient diary entry rather than a struggle that tests her "resourceful" trait in the moment. The "arcane linguist" skill feels more like a magic key than a developed perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya's motivation to find her sister is clear, but the sister herself functions more as a prize to be unlocked than a resistant agent; her refusal melts instantly upon the first attempt at connection. The internal struggle relies on summarized feelings ("loneliness felt as familiar as her own skin") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mira is defined by stated labels ("adaptable," "warm," "methodical") rather than behavior tested by pressure; she resolves the crisis with easy competence and no internal conflict. There is no felt cost to her actions, as she accepts the impossible without psychological struggle or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vera is remarkably grounded; her profession is not just a label but mapped onto her body ("pale lines... earned from decades"). Her interiority is physically embodied (teeth aching from sound, the "hammered repose"), and her motivation to find silence drives every micro-choice, culminating in a decision that redefines her purpose from charter to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s internal conflict between the torment of memory and the duty of hope is well-dramatized. Her motivation is clear, and the shift from viewing her ability as a curse to a blessing feels earned by the vision, though the resolution comes somewhat easily through the artifact rather than a difficult active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and drives the central turn, but interiority often relies on diagnostic labeling ("preemptively nostalgic," "mourning the version of herself") rather than embodied emotion. The character functions well as a vehicle for the concept, but the high volume of analytical self-awareness distances the reader from the visceral cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her reaction to the grandmother's return lacks authentic emotional friction. Accepting a traumatic deception ("I let you think that") without anger or shock flattens the character arc, resolving the internal conflict of grief too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s internal landscape is rendered with specificity, and her realization of her flaw—confusing the study of transitions with living them—feels earned. Elena functions primarily as a recipient for Mira's arc, pivoting from anger to receptivity somewhat quickly for the story's brevity. The emotional cost of Mira's admission anchors the character work effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her internal arc coheres, but the emotional progression relies heavily on summarized realizations ("tasted like possibility") rather than strictly embodied reactions. The distinction between her father's fear and her own adaptation provides a solid character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eris is distinct and competent, and her motivation regarding her daughter is clear. However, the characterization lacks active internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she begins with a fixed purpose and executes it without hesitation, resulting in a static emotional arc rather than a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Meridia is a consistent, competent protagonist with a clear motivation anchored in her backstory as a lore keeper. However, her journey lacks significant internal friction or doubt; she overcomes obstacles with ease, making her ultimate success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira's internal landscape is vivid, and the "shadow keeper" identity effectively frames her isolation. However, Sera feels less like a person and more like a thematic device; her dialogue ("teach suffocating to breathe") leans heavily into melodramatic, diagnostic label-speak rather than grounded character voice, slightly undercutting the emotional realism of the connection.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera is a compelling protagonist with a specific, grounded backstory that informs her present actions ("converting her shame into something useful"). The "virtuously mischievous" trait is dramatized well through the fake shell companies, adding distinct flavor to her redemption arc. Her internal motivation is clear, though the "she had been practicing" beat slightly flattens the immediate struggle of the climax by front-loading her competence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as a passive receptacle for backstory rather than an active agent; emotions are summarized ("felt tears") rather than embodied in choice or struggle. There is no internal conflict; she suspects the truth, receives it, and accepts it without resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's transition from entrenched doubt to total surrender is too frictionless, lacking the psychological resistance that would give the transformation weight. The shift feels mandated by the plot rather than earned through internal struggle or a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clearly established, but her characterization relies on the stock trope of the lonely, broken-hearted librarian finding solace in records. Her backstory (returned ring in a padded envelope) feels generic and lacks the specificity afforded to the historical file. While her internal state is legible, the emotional shift relies more on stated feeling than dramatized character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is a competent archetype without internal friction; she executes a plan flawlessly without doubt, fear, or hesitation. The characterization relies on asserted traits ("underestimated," "carefully resourceful") rather than dramatized struggle, resulting in a static protagonist who faces no meaningful internal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to break the cycle is clear, and the backstory of her sterilization adds necessary weight to her character. However, her internal landscape is rendered through abstract metaphors rather than visceral emotion, keeping the struggle slightly distant. The "prophecy rising" is described as a physical sensation, but the ease with which she suppresses it diminishes the sense of character risk or distinct personality traits beyond competence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    Wren is clearly defined by her role, but she lacks agency at the climax; the dust speck acts upon her rather than her making a difficult choice. The transformation is framed as a pure upgrade without conflicting internal desires or a moment of hesitation, resulting in a low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's internal motivation—moving from precision to accepting entropy—is clear and thematically consistent. However, the shift feels largely intellectual and retrospective ("Her motivation had crystallized during the long descent") rather than dramatized through high-pressure choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.0)
    Character motivation is obscured by the unexplained "search party" context (why is she hiding? why tonight?), and interiority relies on summary of realizations rather than embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maren's internal state is clearly established, but her "modestly fearless" trait is told rather than dramatized through high-stakes choice. The climax relies on passive reception of validation from the spirits rather than an active, character-defining decision, weakening her agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s interiority is visceral and distinct, grounding the high-concept premise in embodied sensation. The transformation from victim to agent is earned through specific perception ("seismograph of suffering"), though the shift to "rewriting" the forest’s code feels slightly rapid in its competence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clearly established, but her internal arc lacks friction; her acceptance of the "between-worlds" role feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The hesitation before taking the fragment attempts to introduce weight, but because her desire aligns perfectly with the "cost," the choice lacks genuine emotional price. The grandmother’s legacy acts more as a set of instructions than a source of complex internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    Miriam is competent and distinct, but she lacks internal friction or genuine struggle. The line "Miriam understood. She always understood" flattens the dramatic tension, positioning her as a passive recipient of the ghost's request rather than an active agent navigating risk or doubt. Her compliance is immediate, leaving her character arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren is a distinct, competent focalizer whose internal philosophy drives the plot. The motivation to shatter the static perfection is clear, though the lack of internal hesitation or conflicting impulses makes her decision feel slightly inevitable rather than struggled for. The cost—the destruction of her life's work—is visible and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's motivation is consistent, and the "revolutionary" backstory effectively informs her final choice to overthrow the boundary of reality. However, the transition from observer to participant feels somewhat smoothed over by the dreamlike tone, and the "poet" attribute manifests in verse that lacks the sophistication of the surrounding narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but the climax relies on diagnostic interiority ("examining his intentions with the same precision," "recognized it immediately") rather than embodied struggle. He identifies his flaw like a mechanic spotting a broken gear, which abstracts the emotional cost and resolves the internal conflict too tidily for the stakes involved.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maren functions as a consistent focalizer, but her interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("hinged awakenings") rather than embodied experience. The final choice to abandon the surface world feels inevitable rather than earned, as the cost is abstract and the opposing pull (the factory world) is painted as purely negative.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Marina serves as a passive vessel for the prompt's concepts rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict. Her transition from "lost" to "enlightened" is an intellectual leap triggered by a magical object, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.7)
    Character motivation is stated rather than dramatized; Mira is "driven" by an abstract question without personal cost or conflicting desires. Interiority relies on high-level summaries ("capturing light in ways that made observers weep") rather than specific, embodied emotion in the moment. The protagonist faces no difficult choices, only an intellectual puzzle that resolves through passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is declared via simile ("burned clear as signal fire") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The protagonist relies on convenience (favors, rusted fences) rather than competence, and the "retrocognitively trapped" label abstracts her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mira functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a struggling protagonist; her competence is absolute and untested by failure or doubt. The narrative relies on asserted motivation ("rejected false comfort") without dramatizing an on-page cost or internal contradiction to earn her final success.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maren is clearly defined, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and diagnostic statements (e.g., "Maren knew the window had opened," "Maren called it the only time...") rather than embodied struggle. The realization of her purpose comes as an intellectual epiphany rather than an emotional cost paid on the page. Her "tears" in the backstory feel generic, lacking specific somatic grounding in the present crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren acts as a consistent focalizer, but her journey is one of smooth competence rather than struggle; she faces no genuine internal resistance or contradictory impulses. The attribute "furious tranquility" appears as a label rather than an embodied behavior, and her success feels inevitable rather than earned through character-specific grit.

    Mira is consistent and competent, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is linear and observational rather than a struggle between competing desires. The pivotal decision (when to ring) is outsourced to an external instruction ("After the glue dries... You will know"), diminishing her agency in the climax. She functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "desperate need to matter") rather than embodied emotion or behavior. The protagonist's internal state feels summarized and static, with wisdom presented as a pre-existing trait rather than a hard-won result of the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maren is a functional, consistent focalizer, but she lacks internal friction; her competence is absolute, rendering the encounter a ritual rather than a struggle. The grandmother's backstory provides motivation, but in the present scene, Maren faces no contradictory impulses or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera is a distinct focalizer with a clear motivation ("understanding" over "more life"), and her specialized senses are well-established. However, her internal landscape lacks friction; she moves through the discovery without contradictory impulses or doubt, making her role feel more like a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.3)
    Mira functions as a static sage figure ("Magical Negro" or wise mentor trope variant) without internal contradiction or struggle. Her interaction with the boy lacks genuine friction, as she resolves his distress with perfect emotional calibration and no personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maren functions as a stoic archetype rather than a complex character; her "brazen calm" precludes internal conflict or doubt. While her competence is clear, the lack of contradictory impulses or struggle against her diagnosis creates a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is defined largely by labels ("skeptic," "academically rebellious") rather than dramatized complexity. Her transformation to "luminous" belief hinges on a sudden, convenient epiphany rather than an earned internal struggle or difficult choice. The lack of visible psychological resistance to the epiphany makes the arc feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Erasmus is a compelling, melancholic presence whose internal state perfectly mirrors the setting. While his dedication is absolute, the score is capped below 9.0 because he lacks the conflicting internal impulses required for the highest band; his choices are procedural rather than tormented, though the cost of his solitude is palpably felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marta's transition from a resigned finder of the dead to a seeker of the living is compelling and well-motivated. The blending of bloodhound instincts with human-level maternal grief creates a distinct, empathetic interiority that grounds the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation to document the cosmos effectively drives the narrative, and her final choice to prioritize the sketch over the ship creates a strong moment of agency and definition. However, the internal monologue relies on somewhat diagnostic labels ("blessed pariah," "cursed to solitude") to define her state rather than purely dramatizing the struggle. The shift from feeling cursed to accepting her "true north" is a clear arc, though slightly rushed in the reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    Corwin is a competent focalizer, but his internal conflict is frictionless; he "felt no guilt" about his theft, removing moral stakes. The character arc relies on external validation (the master's letter) rather than a difficult choice or transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s internal conflict—between the authentic trauma of the camps and the hollow performance of the crisis drills—is actively dramatized and drives the narrative arc. The shift from "performing grief" to "documenting history" feels earned by the specific ritual of the scene, creating a unified and compelling character portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera is a compelling archetype with a distinct internal landscape. The transition from avoidance to acceptance is clear, though the pivotal realization ("She was not too young anymore") relies slightly on assertion rather than dramatized emotional processing. The "mercury" metaphor is perfectly integrated into her psyche and physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus's internal landscape is drawn with precision, and the "sacrifice" of the knight provides a tangible correlative for his emotional shift. However, the epiphany ("taught chess, not murder") arrives with a speed that feels slightly convenient, resolving complex trauma through a single moment of realization rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sera acts with clear agency and a coherent motivation rooted in the prompt's premise. The link between her past mischief and present tactical advantage is a smart character detail. However, her internal landscape lacks contradiction or doubt; she executes her plan with near-perfect competence, and the absence of a personal cost or moment of vulnerability limits the depth of the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vera's internal landscape of "uncertainty" and grief is vivid, though her agency is somewhat subordinated to the magical ritual; she endures rather than actively deciding between competing viable options. The connection between her specific memories and the alchemy creates a strong emotional texture, though the epiphany regarding "uncertainty as strength" feels slightly more stated than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Edwin is a fully realized, inhabited character; his internal landscape of grief and artistic drive is rendered with nuance. The backstory of the daughter is effectively compressed into the seashell artifact, creating deep emotional stakes without flashback clutter. The shift from nostalgia to "fragmentation" feels earned by his on-page struggle in the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s internal landscape is lyrical and consistent, but the emotional peak relies on labeled feeling (“screaming tenderness”) rather than embodied struggle or contradictory impulse. The boy functions largely as a recipient of her wisdom rather than an agent of equal pressure, which softens the central relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is distinct, and her decision to stay and build establishes strong agency and endurance. The shift from passive interpretation to active construction is well-motivated by the calls, though the "geography of loss" motivation relies slightly on abstract labeling rather than purely embodied desire.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren is a sharply drawn focalizer whose professional background ("soil pH," "mycelia") informs her worldview and coping mechanisms. The internal conflict between her rational detachment and the emotional devastation of the virus is dramatized effectively. Her shift from isolationist to active resistor is earned through the visceral relief of the climax ("The lie came out smooth").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn eccentric whose internal logic justifies the supernatural elements. His transition from a passive archivist of "borrowed memories" to an active agent seeking closure for another represents a clear Decisive Change. The emotional weight of his choice is felt, grounded in a consistent character history.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clearly drawn, and her renunciation of the shop represents a significant cost. However, the pivotal internal shift ("She understood then that the doorway didn't offer escape") relies on summarized epiphany rather than dramatized emotional processing, which slightly distances the reader from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (survival vs. cowardice) is compelling and drives the narrative arc. However, the psychological mechanism—repressing the memory of a murder witnessed directly for seven years until a firefly triggers it—feels convenient and slightly lowers the character's grounding in reality. The "softly commanding" trait appears as a descriptor rather than a demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira's central realization is delivered to her by Theo ("I know why you're really going... It's in the attention") rather than earned through her own struggle, rendering her somewhat passive in the climax. However, her decision to gift the shell constitutes a solid on-page action that creates genuine cost, recovering agency at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vera’s internal state is distinct, but the emotion is often diagnosed ("Jealousy," "Feral nostalgia") rather than embodied in action. The shift from fear to acceptance is motivated, but the diagnostic interiority creates distance in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elena functions as a static archetype of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; her lack of internal conflict or active struggle makes the interaction feel rehearsed. Margaret serves primarily as a vessel for grief, relying on stock physical cues ("knuckles white," "eyes carried storms") rather than specific, individualized characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's internal struggle is perfectly externalized via the ice mechanic, allowing her interiority to drive the plot. Her decision to write on her own skin is a decisive, high-agency choice that reconfigures her limitations into a tool, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is a functional protagonist, but the "gossip-column" persona is stated in exposition rather than demonstrated through behavior or voice in the scene. The dialogue leans heavily on expository declaration of traits ("You always advises...") rather than organic interaction. Motivation is clear, but the emotional connection feels efficient rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is an archetypal function rather than a realized character; interiority remains abstract and devoid of contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Motivation is declared ("unravel cosmic illusions") rather than felt through struggle, and the transformation at the end feels inevitable rather than earned by difficult choice. The character observes and enacts a ritual but lacks the agency to wrestle with genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Einar is a distinct, atmospheric protagonist, but his transition from seventeen years of dismissal to the sudden decision to perform the ritual lacks on-page friction or a dramatized trigger event beyond the date. While his curiosity is established, the absence of doubt or hesitation during the process makes him feel slightly functional rather than fully agentic in the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maya’s characterization successfully bridges the gap between the technical (intrusion detection) and the emotional (grief) without feeling forced. The internal conflict—her protective instinct versus the need to open up—is dramatized well through her interaction with the environment. The shift from observer to participant is earned, though the specific nature of her "spatial gift" borders on convenient magic rather than a grounded skill.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margot's internal landscape is rich, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("humans contain multitudes") rather than embodied emotion. The decision to embrace the "lucid contradiction" feels more like an intellectual summary than a visceral, high-stakes choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera is a compelling focalizer; her "deliberate estrangement" provides a grounded internal motivation for her role as a metaphysical switchboard operator. While she functions largely as a guide for the caller, her specific competence and the cost of her isolation prevent her from becoming a mere plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marguerite is a cohesive figure, but her pivotal realization occurs largely in summary ("Now she understood") rather than through dramatized struggle. She lacks contradictory impulses in the scene; her interaction with the Keeper is compliant and frictionless, offering no resistance to generate character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s defining trait—running from gratitude—creates a sharp internal conflict that the plot specifically targets and resolves. Her defensive humor ("desperately jocular") and the shift to vulnerability are well-dramatized, earning the character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Meridia’s interiority is excellently grounded in her specific sensory limitations; she perceives the world strictly through touch and vibration, never slipping into visual metaphors. The emotional renunciation at the end is earned by her specific history and professional discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera is a compelling protagonist with deep, embodied interiority. The tension between her guilt and her professional duty is palpable, and the transition from "punishing herself" to "editing history" is earned through specific memories of her mentor. The attribute "confidently uncertain" is well-integrated into her decision-making process, though the phrase itself repeats slightly too often.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Character motivation is legible, and the "ghost" dynamic is compelling, but the relationship lacks necessary friction; the immediate, frictionless alignment between Mira and Elena bypasses genuine interpersonal struggle. Internal states are often summarized with diagnostic labels ("joy at finally being witnessed") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("analytically intuitive") rather than dramatized skill. Miriam's acceptance of the revelation—that she is the product of a multidimensional breeding program—is instantaneous and lacks the internal conflict or horror such a discovery typically warrants, reducing her to a passive vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira's motivation is viscerally grounded in loss, and her internal conflict between the pain of the procedure and the beauty of the connection is compelling. The final beat—accepting "compliance" as a mask for her completed secret rebellion—adds a satisfying layer of complexity to her character, showing earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Celia is a distinct protagonist with grounded expertise, and her skill in reading footsteps is well-dramatized. However, her pivot from territorial guardian to helpful guide happens too smoothly, lacking the internal friction or reluctance that would heighten the character dynamics and earn the partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guardian's silent vigil is established with dignity, and her motivation is clear. However, the boy functions primarily as a prop for her redemption rather than a fully realized agent; his internal state is assumed rather than dramatized through distinct behavior beyond generic "hunching."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Eleanor is a competent protagonist with a clear motivation, but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses in this scene. She begins and ends with the same certainty, executing a plan without grappling with doubt or a difficult choice that would test her resolve. The "weight of words" is mentioned but operates more as a superpower than a crucible exerting pressure on her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is viscerally grounded in physical transformation, creating immediate urgency. The relationship with Jonas serves as an effective emotional crucible, giving weight to Mira's departure through his specific, grounded reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's coping mechanism of narrating her life creates a distinct, layered interiority that effectively reveals her performer background. The dissonance between her performed "blankness" and internal heaviness is embodied well in the dishwashing and whittling beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mora is defined by poetic labels ("cloud-shadow poet") and a stated aesthetic philosophy rather than through choices made under pressure. Her single moment of internal doubt is immediately resolved by the environment's magical reassurance, stripping the narrative of genuine agency or character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal conflict—artistic success vs. the desire for "true" perception—is dramatized with precision, driving the narrative arc. The attribute "innocently cunning" is well-integrated, manifesting in her calculated preparation of the plant arrangement to negotiate a mystical trade.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira is a distinct presence with a unique sensory perspective, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("Mira understood," "She realized") rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional peak—weeping at the fifth station—feels unearned by the preceding low-pressure beats, making her transformation read as intellectually scheduled rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her pivotal transition from isolation to community leader occurs in summary ("They came to her... First, she taught them"), depriving the reader of the struggle and cost of that change. The emotional arc is reported rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera's motivation—data collection disguised as divination—is distinct, driving the interaction and subverting the mystic archetype. Her analytical detachment contrasts sharply with the client's emotional rawness, and the grandmother's influence grounds her methodology in specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared via label ("steadily unpredictable") rather than dramatized through pressure; the shift to using "chaos" feels like a functional prompt requirement rather than an organic character trait. The connection to the grandmother provides a necessary emotional anchor, but the internal conflict is resolved somewhat too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's agency drives the resolution through a tangible sacrifice (the river stone). While her motivation is clear, the interiority relies on abstract labels like "luminous regret" rather than embodied contradiction or hesitation, slightly flattening the emotional cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    Vera's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("To balance self-respect and compassion meant acknowledging...") rather than embodied struggle. While her motivation is clear, the emotional processing feels summarized and tidy, lacking the raw, contradictory impulses of a fresh betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motivation—rejecting the "cure" to find her mother—is compelling and drives the scene. The brother’s shift from opposition to accomplice is swift but grounded in established trust ("trusted the wound"), effectively serving the short format without feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vera is a distinct focalizer with a specific, enacted skillset, though her internal journey lacks friction; she achieves her goal without significant resistance or contradictory impulses. The "spatial imagination" attribute informs her perception well, but the emotional arc feels somewhat linear and safe, lacking the raw, embodied struggle of a higher-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype with clear motivation, but lacks the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her choice to turn the dial is unopposed by any personal doubt or conflicting need, making her agency feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with a clear backstory, but her competence is absolute, leaving no room for internal struggle or doubt during the crisis. Her motivation is exposited ("Her motivation was simple...") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s agency is strong, and the sacrifice of her talisman anchors her arc in a legible cost. However, the pivotal decision is described as happening "without thinking," which slightly undercuts the dramatic weight of the choice by framing it as instinct rather than a conscious trade-off of values.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.3)
    Mira functions as a passive vessel for the concept rather than an agent of change; her defining traits are retrospective labels ("small fears") rather than demonstrated behaviors. The "vigil" is a guided tour where she observes rather than chooses, and the final reclamation of courage is a transaction without resistance or internal cost. The emotional arc relies on therapeutic affirmation ("You were surviving") rather than dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s internal landscape, colored by the specific sensory distortion of her regenerating nerves, creates a distinct filter for the narrative. Her motivation is clear and escalates naturally to the final choice, though the moment of decision relies slightly on explicit internal monologue rather than purely dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is a distinct presence, and the contradiction of a "diminutive titan" is visually engaging, but she faces minimal internal or external resistance. Her competence is absolute; she solves the mystery and executes the plan without hesitation or struggle, resulting in a lack of felt difficulty or vulnerability on the page. The motivation is clear, but the absence of a personal trade-off limits emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marina is a deeply realized focalizer whose internal rhythm (tapping) bridges her backstory, anxiety, and professional task. The conflict between her grief for her grandmother and her duty to the truth creates a tangible internal pressure that resolves in a decisive, costly action (transmitting the data). Her agency drives every beat of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. The protagonist acts as a passive vessel for the epiphany, moving from doubt to resolution via external intervention (the stones) without a demonstrated internal struggle or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira’s motivation is delivered via exposition ("Her motivation was simple...") rather than dramatized choice. Her primary actions rely on external conveniences (a child finding the kite) or her passive telepathic gift providing the answers, eroding agency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mariam’s interiority is distinct and grounded in specific trauma responses, avoiding generic angst. However, the reliance on clinical definitions ("somatic markers," "freeze response") to explain her state creates a slight diagnostic distance that buffers the raw emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Eleanor's motivation is clearly established, and her internal state mirrors the external conflict. However, her epiphany feels more like a result of interaction with the magical prop than a hard-won internal struggle; the realization is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Seren’s motivation, rooted in the loss of her brother, is compelling and clearly drives her obsession with the time distortion. The interiority is solid, particularly the connection between the ink's memory and her trauma. However, the specific trait "consciously wild" feels like an inserted label rather than an organic aspect of her personality, and her albinism is largely cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's internal state is delivered via labels ("bravely conflicted") rather than embodied struggle. The mother's presence adds personal stakes, but the decision to sacrifice her safety for the truth feels rushed and lacks the visceral weight of a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is distinct, with Mira's internal conflict (father's violence vs. her cultivation) dramatized clearly through the reflex to the knife. The "senselessly perceptive" trait is integrated well into the climax, allowing her to read the soldier's intent rather than just acting on generic intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren's defining trait ("cool-headed fisher") is not merely ornamental but instrumental to the climax; her ability to "voice silence" derives directly from her occupational discipline. The emotional arc is distinct, moving from rigid grief to a specific, resonant reconfiguration of purpose ("fish for stars") that feels earned by the daughter's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Margaret’s internal pivot from resentment to understanding is efficient and well-motivated by the props (the notebooks). The shift in her perception of her father feels earned, though the "devotedly observant" trait relies slightly more on authorial assertion than dramatized nuance in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motivation is sharply defined and drives the narrative; her agency in the climax is absolute. The connection between her professional expertise (constellation tattooing) and personal trauma is seamless. A slight lack of internal contradiction or resistance in the final choice keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s internal landscape is vivid, and her motivation (finding meaning in the void) drives the narrative effectively. The specific worldview of an artist "unlearning" is well-rendered. However, the explicit labeling of her trait ("She was socially perceptive, always had been") is a diagnostic tell that momentarily flattens the characterization before the scene dramatizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kira functions effectively as a vehicle for the plot, but her interiority relies on stated labels ("gentle radical") rather than contradictory impulses in the moment. While her empathy is established, she lacks the internal friction or specific, non-functional flaws that would deepen the characterization beyond her role as a historian-hero.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    Madeline’s internal landscape is vivid and her motivation is clear, but the "young woman" serves merely as a passive prop for the protagonist's agency. The lack of resistance or distinct personality in the secondary character lowers the dramatic charge of the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya's internal state is rendered with sensory precision, grounding the supernatural premise in the body. The "affectionate skeptic" trait is established via summary rather than active resistance in the present moment, making her acceptance of the somatic clues feel slightly rushed. The motivation to find Daniel is clear and drives the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.3)
    Vera functions more as a passive observer than an active protagonist; she lacks internal contradiction or a hierarchy of values tested under pressure. Her motivation is stated ("gift, her burden") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and she undergoes no significant internal shift or cost by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.3)
    Marlowe functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a character under pressure; her "understanding" is immediate and internal contradiction is absent. The emotional landscape is summarized ("patience," "inspired") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Margaret is a sharply realized protagonist whose physical scars effectively map her internal state. The conflict between her professional cynicism ("patterns meant nothing") and her lingering need for closure drives the narrative without needing external exposition. Her final choice to accept the burden without offering absolution demonstrates a complex, earned interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Coachman is a realized presence with a consistent internal landscape ("sewing meaning from chaos") that justifies the final gesture. The passenger serves primarily as a thematic foil, and their connection feels slightly accelerated to serve the page count. The Coachman’s choice to part with the heirloom needle provides a solid, character-driven moment of closure with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Serin is a functional, consistent protagonist whose "zen" nature aligns well with the potter archetype ("expect nothing"). Her decision to stay feels motivated by the events, though her internal struggle is somewhat abstractly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina is a distinct, felt presence with a consistent worldview that informs her actions. Her motivation—bridging the gap between the dead and the living—is effectively dramatized through the reflected light, though the link between the "missing tooth" of the rose and the "bitting gauge tooth" relies on a slightly convenient associative hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s internal shift is clear, but the pivot relies heavily on a summarized "reincarnation memory" from three weeks ago rather than an immediate, on-page realization. Her emotional arc is coherent, but the lack of active struggle or doubt during the ritual makes her feel more like an executor of a prior decision than a character under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s internal conflict between her role as a vessel and her need for personal connection is articulated with precision. The shift from observer to participant is earned through introspection, though the epiphany in the letter feels slightly performative rather than rawly vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s shift to weaponizing "curiosity" is a sophisticated character beat that demonstrates her specific intellect and worldview. However, her interiority frequently functions as exposition for the antagonist's nature rather than exploring her own immediate emotional contradiction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Helena’s claustrophobia serves as a functional internal antagonist that complicates the physical journey. However, the psychological "negotiation" feels somewhat abstract and summarized ("determination answered louder") rather than viscerally dramatized in the moment of crisis. The motivation is clear, but the character reads more as an archetype of the "driven explorer" than a deeply particularized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clara’s prosopagnosia acts as a rigorous narrative lens rather than a gimmick, driving her unique methodology and fueling the thematic pivot from identification to empathy. The choice to humanize the perpetrator is earned through her specific way of seeing, creating a complex internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira functions as a delivery mechanism for the plot rather than a complex agent under pressure. Her motivation ("debts unpaid") is stated in exposition but does not force a difficult choice or sacrifice on the page. The "nervous confidence" trait appears as a label rather than a dramatized behavioral conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Margaret's internal pivot is legible and emotional, grounded in the specific backstory of the lost photography career. However, the attribute "dynamically observant" feels inserted as a functional label to enable the plot rather than a deep character trait that complicates the choice. The transition from resignation to action is smoothed significantly by the magical "gift," reducing the character's agency in the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s arc from shame to polished calm and finally to acceptance is compelling and well-compressed. His motivation for the startup—as a flight from his origins—drives the narrative efficiently. The internal conflict regarding his father is resolved through credible, understated action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions as a passive vessel for decoding rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. Her primary trait ("lucid dream chronicler") is treated as backstory and exposition ("This was her gift") rather than a skill that actively shapes the waking solution mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("fear that she was nothing," "something fundamental from her identity") rather than embodied experience. While the "guarded" trait is consistent, the emotional climax is filtered through a list of abstract nouns ("guilt, relief, terror") instead of specific, grounded reactions. The backstory of the magic trick feels slightly mechanical, serving the prompt more than organic character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s realization of her role as an anchor creates a valid internal arc, shifting from "we go together" to understanding her stasis. However, the explicit labeling of her emotion ("anxious elation") in a peak beat flattens the embodied experience, and her interaction with the seven strangers feels procedural rather than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is established via the grandmother's confession, and the internal void is consistent. However, the &quot;reckless&quot; trait is told (&quot;everyone said so&quot;) rather than demonstrated in scene; Mira's behavior is calm and deliberate, creating a disconnect between the label and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is well-drawn with a specific internal contradiction (expert appraiser vs. personal worth). However, Val functions primarily as a narrative device to facilitate his healing, delivering perfectly calibrated thematic questions ("what's left?") moments after meeting him, which strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    Characterization is consistent, with the "kindly methodical" trait serving as a distinct filter for her grief. However, the protagonist lacks contradictory impulses in the scene; her decision to abandon her former life meets no internal resistance, making the "cost" mentioned in the warning feel abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira is a distinct presence, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("liminal state," "migrating nature") rather than embodied emotion. The "bitter experience" of the past is summarized rather than dramatized, making her resilience feel intellectualized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    Character motivation is legible, but the climax relies on heavy "therapy-speak" ("vulnerable without feeling destroyed") that reads as diagnostic rather than embodied. This over-articulation of interiority reduces the emotional authenticity of the confession, turning a raw moment into a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s internal conflict is clear, but her interiority often slips into diagnostic label-speak ("convergence of grief and growth," "raw solace... is the only kind that heals"). This self-analysis flattens the immediate emotional cost of the crisis, replacing embodied struggle with therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is laser-focused, and the "Veiled Dreamer" persona effectively externalizes her guarded nature. Her agency drives the investigation, utilizing the watch to decipher the library's logic rather than stumbling upon the answer. The moment of forgiveness feels slightly rapid given the "salvation or ruin" setup, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's internal conflict is stark and embodied, driving a choice that carries immediate, irreversible personal cost (being forsworn). The decision to destroy the object to save its essence creates a powerful definition of character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s specific vocational lens (“beautician mortician”) effectively colors her perception, giving her a distinct internal voice. However, she lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; her success relies on established competence rather than a difficult choice or personal cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira is a coherent focalizer with a clear internal wound, though her interiority leans toward diagnostic abstraction ("souls too wounded to stay") rather than embodied struggle. Her "kindly decisive" nature is stated as a label rather than fully dramatized through difficult choices, softening the character edge.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Keeper is a distinct, professional presence, and her internal landscape ("wearing borrowed coats") is compelling. However, the trait "sincerely insincere" operates more as a narrated label than a dramatized friction in the scene. The client, Sera, fulfills her role competently but lacks the specific, contradictory interiority that would elevate the stakes beyond a standard consultation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s condition ("grief of youth," memories growing heavier) provides a strong, embodied constraint that anchors his characterization. However, the opening line describes him as a "child," while the second paragraph describes him as appearing "no older than forty," creating an immediate visualization clash. Vara functions primarily as a recipient of wisdom; her desperation is stated ("needed it desperately") rather than dramatized through distinct behavior in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    Vessa functions as a mythic archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle in the present moment. While the backstory hints at a transition from foolishness to wisdom, her current state is static perfection; she faces no difficult choices or doubts, making her role purely functional within the fable-like structure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and thematically resonant, driving the narrative effectively. However, the "mist walking" sequence creates a slight dissonance; her easy mastery of this technique undermines the established "underachiever" trait, even if thematically aligned with "surrender." The internal struggle at the climax is resolved relatively quickly, lacking a visceral sense of temptation before the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus is a clearly motivated protagonist with a distinct internal landscape dominated by grief. The tension between his duty (the lantern festival) and his obsession (the library) provides a solid emotional anchor. However, the climax (uncorking the vial) lacks a moment of on-page struggle or hesitation; he proceeds with a certainty that minimizes the weight of the choice until after it is made.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's internal conflict between "stellar doubt" and the certainty of the prophecy provides a solid emotional anchor. However, the motivation is explicitly stated ("that was her motivation") rather than emerging solely through action, and the "quiet enthusiasm" feels slightly constrained by the prompt rather than organic to the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is legible, but the "reaper in love" archetype relies on stock emotional signals ("shattered," "broken") rather than specific, embodied contradiction. The arc is linear—from sadness to healing—without a moment where the protagonist's desires sharply conflict in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corin is a compellingly distinct focalizer; his "lukewarm" nature is not just a trait but the engine of the narrative resolution. His internal landscape of "brittle devotion" is well-rendered, though the lack of an interpersonal dynamic or active antagonist leaves his struggle largely internal and abstract. A sharper on-page sacrifice or a moment where his "naivety" costs him something before paying off would elevate the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Martha's internal conflict is clear, but her emotional resolution—shifting from a lifetime of deception to soft laughter and acceptance in a single beat—feels unearned and tidy (therapy-speak anti-pattern). The transition bypasses the messy, visceral reality of betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is consistent and her motivation is clear, but the internal conflict ("secretly sentimental" vs. logic) feels asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult choice. The "sentimental" trait enables the solution rather than creating friction or cost, resulting in a character who moves through the plot without genuine struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera is a solidly realized protagonist with clear internal conflict rooted in specific backstory (mother’s death). Her motivation to avoid the error of "instinct over observation" drives the central choice effectively. The emotional logic holds up well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kira acts as a therapist-expositor, diagnosing the clones with explicit "label-speak" ("You seek copies because...") rather than allowing motives to emerge through action. The clones function as passive recipients of this insight rather than agents driving the scene. The "broken halves" dynamic is declared rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera is a clearly defined protagonist with a distinct worldview that motivates her rejection of the buyout. Her internal logic is consistent, though her decision-making process relies heavily on the "sign" from the seed rather than a dramatized internal struggle over the financial loss.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Victor’s emotional arc is keenly felt and internally consistent, effectively grounding the surreal profession ("leaf blower symphony conductor") in genuine grief. The transition from calcified silence to the decision to reach out is earned through the on-page struggle. A minor note: the profession, while integrated, teeters on the edge of the absurd, but Victor's earnestness anchors it successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's voice contradicts her description; she is introduced as "feral," "untethered," and forgetting language, yet speaks in polished, therapeutic aphorisms ("Home is a flexible concept"). This dissonance undermines the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and the "hopelessness" is interestingly framed as a tactical choice. However, the emotional summary at the end ("feeling nothing and everything") is generic, flattening the complexity built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira demonstrates clear agency and competence in her technical problem-solving, grounding the abstract premise in action. However, the emotional peak ("wept, though she couldn't have explained why") relies on a diagnostic shortcut rather than embodied experience, and her motivation feels slightly like a declared slogan rather than a lived drive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation to save the passengers is consistent, and the final splitting demonstrates a high-stakes embodied cost. However, her "resiliently positive" trait is often asserted through narrator labeling ("bright edge of someone who had accepted the impossible") rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the story's middle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marina is drawn with precision; her internal conflict between "sanity and certainty" and the later realization that connection requires "tension" rather than comfort creates a sophisticated, coherent arc. The shift from ambition to negotiation is earned through on-page struggle, and her interiority is deeply specific to her role as an architect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vara is a competent, grounded protagonist whose internal shift—from confident expert to humble novice—is well-dramatized. Her reaction to the epiphany ("strange joy," "somber gift") provides genuine emotional texture. However, the attribute "balancedly curious" is delivered via "as-you-know" dialogue rather than demonstrated action, slightly weakening the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera functions efficiently as a narrative device rather than a character with internal friction; her "persistent curiosity" and loneliness are stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The interaction lacks status dynamics or emotional risk for the protagonist, resulting in a competent but flat execution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the narrative; the "terror kept her sharp" rationale effectively bridges the claustrophobia trait to the action. While the fear adds texture, it functions more as a static condition than an active obstacle forcing a difficult tactical trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The heartbeat counting serves as an excellent physiological anchor that tracks the character's arc from anxiety to resolution. However, the internal landscape relies too heavily on abstract labels ("wisdom," "resilience") rather than specific, dramatized memories, which blunts the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist functions as a capable archetype rather than a conflicted individual; she lacks contradictory impulses or internal doubts. Her biology (copper veins) conveniently solves the central threat without forcing a difficult character choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal struggle mirrors the antagonist's trajectory, creating a strong thematic link. Her shift from bitterness to devotion is earned through the realization of Samuel's fate, though the emotional transition relies slightly on summary ("Frostbitten hope bloomed") rather than purely dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation and interiority. However, her pivotal realization relies on a sudden, explicitly stated epiphany ("Mira understood now") triggered by the shell rather than a pressurized on-page trade-off. The transition from survivalist to revolutionary feels slightly rushed, with the "heartbeat" tactic appearing fully formed as backstory rather than developed in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, though his internal landscape leans heavily on self-narrated exposition ("ghost carrying grief") rather than dramatized struggle. The young woman serves a functional role as a recipient without generating distinct interpersonal pressure or unexpected reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is clear, but the resolution relies on unearned physiological change; scarring usually requires more than willpower and a halo fragment to heal. The shift from "scarred vocal cords" to singing feels fabulist, clashing with the gritty, rusted realism established early on. The sudden recovery bypasses the necessary struggle and cost associated with the disability.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    Eleanor is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, but she functions more as an observer than an active agent. Her "sane eccentricity" is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs, and her journey feels like a guided tour rather than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam's grief is palpable and motivates the plot well, but her internal transition from obsessed griever to mentor is summarized in the coda rather than dramatized in the scene. The "wept for an hour" reaction feels like a shorthand for emotion rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("enigmatic in the way that water is enigmatic") rather than demonstrated traits. The internal landscape is summarized through metaphor rather than embodied in specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. Mira feels more like an archetype than a specific person.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's internal landscape is compelling, grounding the magical premise in the specific anxiety of a folklorist losing her own history. The shift from passive cataloger to active preserver at the closure acts as a strong character arc. Her motivation is visceral, though the convenience of her retaining the specific magical knowledge required to solve the plot—despite having lost "everything else"—weakens the coherence of her limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is layered and compelling; the shift from "tenderness" to "armor" reveals a sophisticated internal landscape. Mira's backstory is integrated seamlessly to raise the personal stakes of the mentorship decision.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marek is a consistent, competent archetype who acts with wisdom, but he lacks internal friction or contradiction. The narrative relies on his established expertise rather than forcing him into a crucible of difficult choices; his success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or character flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s internal arc is clear, but the climax relies on summary ("Somewhere in the unraveling, she had found her own knot and worked it free") rather than dramatized experience. The shift from trembling trauma to steady resolution happens off-camera within the text, reducing the earned emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena’s professional background as a map framer authentically shapes her perception, driving the central metaphor of "spaces between lines." Her motivation to interpret silence with empathy is dramatized through her interaction with the footage rather than just stated. The choice to remain and report despite the encroaching supernatural threat demonstrates earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eleanor's characterization leans heavily on summarized grief and lists of lost loved ones rather than dramatized struggle. Her interiority often devolves into diagnostic label-speak ("physics of letting go"), particularly in the climax where her realization is explained via summary rather than experienced. The "first name basis with death" trait appears as a static descriptor rather than a driver of behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the concept rather than a fully realized character with internal friction; her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. While her motivation is clear, she lacks a distinct counter-impulse or moment of doubt to give her agency weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions primarily as a delivery system for the diary's instructions rather than an active agent making difficult choices. Her motivation is handed to her via the decrypted text ("You will know what to do"), robbing the climax of a decision made under genuine pressure. The attribute "warmly inquisitive" is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized through a present-moment constraint or tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s internal landscape is vivid, and the "madness" versus "science" tension provides strong interiority. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly cerebral, relying on a clearly articulated realization rather than a messy, embodied shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's tactile worldview is compelling and consistent, grounding her expertise in specific sensory details. However, the emotional arc resolves too smoothly through the discovery of the book, and the "fractally precise" trait reads as an inserted label rather than a demonstrated behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is an active protagonist with a clear drive (curiosity), but her journey lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She faces no difficult micro-choices; her "sociable isolation" is stated rather than tested by genuine pressure or fear. The absence of a personal cost or moment of doubt makes the characterization feel functional rather than deep.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is motivated by a clear desire (to learn the rhythm of repair) and possesses a defined skillset, but her internal arc feels linear and somewhat didactic. The realization at the end is articulated as a lesson learned rather than a hard-won emotional shift born from deep contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a reactive vessel for the ghost's instructions rather than an agent of change; her internal landscape is defined by summary ("Elara had learned") rather than conflicting impulses. The ghost fits the "magical helper" trope with no internal friction or distinct personality beyond benevolent sadness. The emotional arc relies on told emotions ("wept openly," "centuries of loneliness") rather than embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply embodied, grounding the high-concept premise in specific grief. However, the internal monologue occasionally drifts into explanatory summary ("She understood now why she had been chosen"), which distances the reader from the immediate emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren is a compelling protagonist whose reluctance provides excellent friction against her duty. Her internal conflict—resenting the orchard yet mastering its labyrinth—adds depth to what could be a simple rescue mission. The choice to accept the burden at the end feels earned by her competence and the specific "graceless beauty" of her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on diagnostic summaries ("rational mind understood but her heart refused") rather than embodied complexity. The emotional arc is linear and tidy, lacking the contradictory impulses or messy friction of genuine grief processing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Vera's internal landscape—the tension between her past as a forger and her present parole—is compelling, but her arc resolves through passive observation rather than an active, difficult choice. The "child with too-old eyes" functions more as a plot device to trigger the realization than a genuine pressure on Vera's character.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara is a deeply realized protagonist whose internal conflict—the burden of memory versus the hollowness of forgetting—drives every beat. Her agency is sharp; the final surgical choice to retain lessons while discarding toxicity is a nuanced, character-specific resolution to her arc. The emotional contagion is not just a prop but a felt reality that shapes her isolation and final reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena serves as a competent vehicle for the concept but lacks internal friction; her success is immediate, linear, and effectively uncosted. The prompt-required attribute ("empathetically decisive") appears as an expository label rather than a driver of difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vera's motivation is clear, and the "helix-minded" trait integrates well with the climax. However, her internal struggle is minimal; she faces the risk of "losing herself" but overcomes it instantly due to her innate nature, lacking a difficult on-page choice or moment of genuine doubt that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is distinct with her "prism-minded" perception, but her internal arc relies on intellectual summary ("She understood now") rather than visceral struggle. She feels overly competent, facing the inversion without genuine doubt or error, which limits the emotional depth of her transformation into a guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, though the realization regarding "grief stored in the body" leans into diagnostic labeling rather than embodied experience. Her internal state is well-rendered, but the "symphonically minded" trait functions more as a credential than a source of active conflict in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    Helena is clearly drawn with consistent motivation, but her character arc is largely static; the primary cost (exile) is backstory rather than a price paid in the scene. The "hopeful melancholy" is stated as an internal label rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. She succeeds at her task with competence but without a fresh, on-page crucible to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    Vera functions more as a thematic vessel than a living presence; her internal shift ("I forgive myself") relies on diagnostic labeling rather than embodied struggle. The "eclectic pacifist" traits feel assembled from a checklist rather than organically integrated into behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and her sensitivity acts as a genuine constraint that shapes her experience. The internal shift from professional ambition to seeking wisdom is legible, though the final decision to leave feels slightly rushed and relies on a sudden epiphany rather than mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maren functions as a generic vehicle for the plot, lacking internal contradiction or a distinct psychological signature. Her emotional reactions rely on clichés like "heart clench," and her arc resolves through passive reception of wisdom rather than an earned, high-stakes internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s internal landscape is compelling, blending professional competence with specific, grounded grief ("truth revealed itself in absence"). However, the motivation relies heavily on a standard backstory trope (dead father in the same field) to generate depth, rather than a more immediate, pressurized internal conflict unique to this specific crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    Meren’s motivation is clearly stated and drives the narrative, but she lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle. Her success feels preordained by her "gift" rather than earned through difficult choices or trade-offs in the scene; she faces no doubts or limitations that force a deviation from her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira's motivation is sharp and drives the narrative from the first sentence; the tension between her duty to the dead and her "disobedient" need for knowledge creates a strong internal crucible. The choice to uncase the relic is a credible transgression earned by her desperation. However, the epiphany—"The insight burned itself into her understanding"—relies on internal summary rather than a dramatized struggle in the moment of vision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira is a compelling focalizer with a distinct craft, but her internal arc relies heavily on abstract definitions rather than dramatized struggle. The "drowned poet" persona feels like a costume donned for effect rather than a visceral inhabitation, and the resolution comes through intellectual processing rather than emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s transition from "jittery courier" to steady pilgrim feels unearned in the immediate scene, resolving instantly upon a realization rather than through a dramatized struggle. While her motivation is clear, the internal conflict is settled too neatly via reflection, lacking a visceral on-page test of her new resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist whose scientific approach to mysticism avoids clichés. Her internal pivot—from seeking publication to accepting personal truth—creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "cost" of abandoning professional validation feels slightly rushed and asserted rather than weighed deeply in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mei functions primarily as a ritual vessel rather than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. The "latent sacrifice" is accepted without an on-page struggle, making the ultimate cost feel inevitable rather than earned through a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Oren is a functional, consistent archetype who fits the mythic tone well. His transition from meekness to authority is coherent, though his internal landscape is described more through narration than dramatized through pressure-filled micro-choices. The lack of interaction with anyone other than the entity leaves his "meekness" largely theoretical rather than socially demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira’s internal drive is clear, but the emotional resolution relies heavily on witnessing an expository conversation rather than active interrogation of the mystery. The mother's dialogue in the flashback ("The green resonance crystals filter it") reads as functional info-dumping rather than natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s transition from "reticent skipper" to active guardian is earned through specific interaction with the setting. Her internal shift is motivated by the vacuum of the abandoned lighthouse, and the choice to break her silence carries a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is static; she faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or difficult micro-choices. Her motivation is stated rather than tested by pressure, and her "familiar anticipation" replaces the necessary struggle or doubt that characterizes literary depth. She functions as a procedural vehicle for the setting rather than a character with agency under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    Senna’s motivation is clearly established, but her pivotal confession feels precipitated by the magical environment rather than internal pressure, reducing her agency. The "cellular memory" trope is handled with a straightforward sentimentality that lacks the contradictory impulses needed for deeper character work.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s internal arc from confusion to purposeful endurance is anchored by the specific, embodied cost of the "41 units" of grief. The decision to leave her own sorrow with the cypress rather than resolving it demonstrates complex character agency and earned maturity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s arc creates a poignant trajectory with a visible, high cost (loss of self), creating strong emotional resonance. Her agency is slightly diluted when the pivotal swaddling action is described as "instinctive" rather than a conscious derivation, but her choice to endure and complete the ritual redeems the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("Being keenly empathetic meant absorbing others' pain") rather than embodied emotion in the present moment. The protagonist is somewhat passive, receiving wisdom and validation from the librarian rather than arriving at the realization through active struggle or difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mei’s interiority is rich and specific, grounding the abstract concept of "noticing" in concrete sensory details. Her motivation is consistent, though the shift from rage to "heuristically gentle" observation is summarized rather than dramatized in a present-tense crucible, which keeps the emotional arc slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal landscape is well-drawn, with her professional detachment crumbling productively into a necessary act of curation. The motivation is clear and escalates naturally from maintenance to salvage as the environment collapses. The final choice to preserve a specific emotional connection rather than grand historical records effectively defines her character values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliza’s motivation is anchored clearly in her father’s legacy and the specific "truce of hush." Her internal state—using invisibility as a weapon—translates well into action, though the "curiously steadfast" trait feels like an inserted label rather than an organic driver of behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is labeled a "luminous skeptic," but this trait is not dramatized in scene; she accepts high-concept magic (voting trees, weather people) without resistance or interrogation. Her arc relies on passive reception of information from the three figures rather than active discovery or struggle, which flattens the emotional cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking her suppression to her family history. However, the internal conflict lacks grit; her surrender to the "calling" is smooth and inevitable rather than a struggle between genuine competing values. The "curse" is framed as a threat but manifests as a gentle liberation, lowering the dramatic tension of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's unique physiological trait—wilting near dishonesty—is excellently integrated into her identity and world interaction. However, her agency is largely reactive; she follows a scavenger hunt trail laid by others ("found easily," "play spool 7,423") rather than making difficult, active choices under pressure until the final inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maren is a competent professional with a compelling trait (seasonal muteness), but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or struggle. She faces no difficult choice; the solution is technically demanding but emotionally frictionless, making her an effective vehicle for the plot rather than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary. VERA-7’s internal conflict is viscerally embodied—grief manifests as "static" and "white noise," grounding the abstract emotion in her synthetic physiology. The backstory of the suicide protocol ("darker period") brilliantly raises the stakes of the climax, repurposing a tool of self-destruction into one of healing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren is a distinct, capable focalizer, and her motivation to heal through connection is clear. However, her insight into the daughter's psyche ("leads her guilt like a dog") feels slightly more like authorial convenience than earned character deduction, and the "curator of memories" persona borders on romanticized.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a living character under pressure. Motivation is stated ("Marina knew better now") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal conflict. The emotional arc is summarized in exposition ("She had wanted Marina to know...") rather than experienced through action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira acts as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized agent; her decision to disobey orders is immediate and unconflicted. The "bloodline" revelation in the chamber retroactively removes the danger of the sphere, undercutting her bravery and reducing her role to a "chosen one" trope rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The sudden discovery of the salt key, which she had supposedly missed "a thousand times," feels like an authorial convenience rather than an earned breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent, proactive protagonist whose expertise drives the narrative. While her motivation is clear and the internal monologue consistent, the lack of significant internal conflict or doubt during the ritual makes her success feel somewhat inevitable; she executes a known process without a moment of genuine crisis or moral wrestle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator is distinct but passive, accepting the supernatural premise and the successor role without dramatized internal conflict or a high-stakes choice that tests their resolve. The transition from neighbor to apprentice happens largely through summary rather than scene-based struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mirabel’s internal landscape is well-rendered, balancing her past skepticism with present desperation. The transition from isolation to a redefined independence is a strong, earned internal arc, though the rapid resolution of the external conflict slightly softens the "independence" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veren’s internal landscape is compelling; the transition from "calcified guilt" to the release of "unlinking" is dramatized through specific, embodied action. The connection between his craft and his emotional redemption feels earned and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is sharply defined and drives the narrative arc from curiosity to existential rebellion. The final choice—a renunciation of her defining gift (singing) to survive and resist—demonstrates a high-stakes internal reconfiguration with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal friction; the moral dilemma of destroying a living man's reputation for a dead man's crime is acknowledged conceptually but not felt. Her interiority largely explains the magic system rather than dramatizing the personal cost of the "knife" decision.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mirelle is a distinct, consistent presence with a clear worldview that links her occupation to her philosophy. Her motivation is well-internalized, though the lack of on-page struggle or high-stakes trade-offs limits the dramatic weight of her character arc; she observes rather than deciding between difficult options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Maya is a competent focalizer, but her motivation is stated ("unshakeable motivation") rather than tested by genuine dilemma or cost. She moves through the plot efficiently, yet her internal state lacks friction; she accepts the fantastical premises (shredded letters, magic diamond) without the skepticism her profession implies, resulting in a functional but static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Miriam is a realized presence with clear internal contours, but Caro functions as a pliable device rather than a character. The antagonist's instant capitulation to Miriam's philosophy dissolves the interpersonal tension necessary for a high-stakes turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.4)
    Marcus is a romanticized archetype rather than a living character; he lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or active struggle on the page. His "wistful" state is static, and the text relies on labeled emotion rather than embodied reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s internal landscape is well-drawn, merging her engineering background with her ancestral duty in a way that motivates the final sacrifice. The "logically emotional" trait acts as a functional pivot for her decision-making, though it relies slightly on exposition ("a trait her mother called...") rather than pure dramatization. The cost of her choice is visceral and character-specific, grounding the mystical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is competent but static; her primary conflict (impatience vs. patience) is resolved in backstory rather than dramatized through present-moment micro-choices. She faces no immediate resistance that forces a character-defining decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.6)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("associative recall," "fortified vulnerability") rather than embodied emotion. The shift from compliance to rebellion ("No more") feels summarized rather than earned through immediate pressure or struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is a consistent, coherent protagonist with clear motivation (guilt/redemption). His internal state is legible, though the realization—that mending the object requires self-implication—feels slightly guided by external cues (Ruth, the weather) rather than deep psychological pressure, making the arc feel a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zephyr is a compelling focalizer; her "aggressive curiosity" is dramatized through the specific action of repurposing the arrow, and her final choice to launch renounces safety for transcendence with clear, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Helena’s motivation is clearly anchored in her backstory ("where do deleted files go?"), driving her agency. However, her transition from employee to fugitive is swift, lacking the internal friction or hesitation that would make the high-stakes choice to steal data feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kira is passive at the climax; the Keeper diagnoses her flaw ("You've given so much empathy...") and resolves it via a magic ritual rather than her making a hard choice. The realization is delivered through diagnostic dialogue rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s internal state is vivid, and the shift from control to surrender is compelling. However, the pivotal transition—joining the relief crew despite her stroke—is summarized rather than dramatized, bypassing the physical reality and struggle of that decision.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marcus is clearly drawn as a sentinel of loss, but the dialogue relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("intersubjective understanding") that shatters naturalism. The characters sound like thematic devices rather than people, with no distinct emotional contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, with the "half-masked" aspect effectively symbolizing her thematic role between past and future. Her specific trait of being "strangely honest" anchors her dialogue and choices, adding nuance to the archetype of the wandering fixer. While her internal conflict is somewhat muted by her high competence—she never truly doubts her course—her interactions with the keeper provide necessary emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Maren functions as a static catalyst rather than a protagonist; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a moment where her competence fails. Her "perceptively calm" demeanor creates a distance that prevents genuine engagement with the stakes, as she faces no personal cost or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is grounded in consistent traits, though the shift from academic curiosity to "desperation" is told in summary rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The internal state is vivid, but the character faces no active opposition beyond the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus is a compelling protagonist whose defining limitation—precognitive forgetfulness—creates immediate, inherent tension. The shift in motivation from the physical goal ("locate something") to the abstract desire ("capture the sound of growing older") is slightly fluid, but the final resignation is an earned emotional beat that respects his established character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and poignant, anchored in grief, but she functions primarily as a recipient of the sage’s wisdom rather than a driver of the action until the final choice. The internal state is occasionally summarized with prompt-phrase labels ("luminous ache") rather than fully embodied behavior, though the decision to stay earns the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Samuel's emotional transition from "terrified" to hope occurs too rapidly and without sufficient resistance, resolving complex internal conflict through a single conversation. The protagonist's "decisively kind" nature functions more as a magic key than a trait tested by pressure, resulting in a tidy rather than earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mira is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but she lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; her success relies on convenient competence rather than navigating conflicting impulses. Her emotional reactions are standard ("heart raced") rather than character-specific, and she faces no genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eleanor’s internal conflict between clinical skepticism and familial grief is drawn with precision, driving the decision to dig. The pivot from doctor to researcher of the impossible is motivated by the tactile evidence of the tooth and bones. Her agency is paramount; the desecration of the grave is a bold, character-defining choice that earns the shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren is drawn with clear motivation and consistent interiority, but the lack of present-tense resistance makes her emotional arc feel static. The epiphany comes without a struggle or "crucible" moment in the scene; she simply executes a plan she already understands, reducing the stakes of her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization as a "watchful dreamer" is not merely labeled but enacted through her attention to the moss, directly fueling the "quietly proactive" closure. The transition from observer to participant is earned by her internal processing of the pendant's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's epiphany is delivered externally by an apparition rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice. The dialogue leans heavily into diagnostic label-speak ("You keep starting our story... swim against the current of its truth"), which flattens the character differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is a sympathetic focalizer, but her characterization leans on the "whimsical tinkerer" archetype without subverting it. The internal conflict—her musical insecurity—is resolved too swiftly by "blood memory" and the machine's aid, reducing the felt cost of the climax to a token struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is well-defined through the contrast between her "flash-paper" training and her learned patience. The physical toll of her craft (missing fingers) anchors her backstory effectively. However, the scene lacks an active internal struggle; her choices are predetermined by the ritual, making her agency feel procedural rather than urgent in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is competently drawn with a clear, intellectually grounded motivation that drives the narrative. However, the lack of immediate, high-pressure friction results in a character who acts without facing a significant, agonizing choice or trade-off on the page; her success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and survival-driven, but her internal arc feels linear; the threat of calcification is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the scene. She functions more as a vehicle for the ritual than a character making difficult trade-offs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marguerite’s interiority is deeply felt and specific, grounding the grief in the tangible actions of carving. The motivation to "contain" her loss is consistent and poignant, though the narrative leans heavily on reflection (approx. 30%) rather than immediate interaction. The emotional progression feels authentic, moving from memory to a stabilized "earned stasis" without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Character motivation is clear and the internal conflict is well-externalized through the ghost. However, the protagonist's pivotal realization relies heavily on "therapy-speak" articulated by a secondary source (the overheard old man) rather than an organic, embodied discovery in the moment. This reduces the emotional agency of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is competent but lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she moves from observation to solution without facing genuine obstacles or making difficult trade-offs. The emotional arc feels stated rather than dramatized, with motivation ("desperately wanted to understand") driving procedural action rather than character-defining choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but the "subconscious transcription" reveal undermines the difficulty of her choice, making the transition feel inevitable rather than earned through active struggle. The flashback to the grandmother provides a tidy moral rather than generating character-specific friction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maren is consistent, but her primary internal conflict is resolved via an external explanation (the father's letter) rather than dramatized struggle. Her reaction to the climax—"serene upheaval"—is an abstract label rather than an embodied emotion or complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira is consistent and competent, but her primary trait ("infinitely patient") is applied as a label rather than dramatized through struggle against impatience. She lacks contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict, functioning more as a vessel for the theme than a complex agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is a compelling, distinct focalizer with a unique vocation that informs her worldview. The internal landscape of grief is rich, though the shift from her initial goal ("write her own obituary") to the actual action (writing her brother's) feels slightly unbridged, creating a minor motivation gap.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    Aldric's motivation is sharp and drives the narrative from the first paragraph. The "mad scientist" archetype is executed with competence, though the internal conflict is somewhat muted until the realization of "flawed genesis." The shift from seeking restoration to accepting innovation is a solid character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    The character's internal arc is resolved through diagnostic realization ("That was the secret, she realized") rather than embodied action or difficult choice. The "gracefully alert" repetition feels like a forced prompt insertion that momentarily flattens the character into a puppet. While the backstory motivation is clear, the emotional resolution reads as therapeutic essay rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.3)
    Character traits ("luminous skeptic") appear as narrator labels rather than drivers of action; Mira accepts supernatural elements without the promised skepticism. The emotional arc of the sacrifice is resolved too tidily, bypassing the necessary grief or weight of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.3)
    Veloris is an archetype rather than a fully realized character; her "sorrows" are stated labels rather than dramatized experiences. She faces no difficult choice or internal resistance, merely executing a procedural solution without paying a personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal landscape is cohesive, and the mentorship dynamic is established efficiently. However, the "fiercely meditative state" reads as a label rather than a dramatized struggle, and her emotional progression feels slightly linear without contradictory impulses testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interiority is distinct, and the weight of her guilt is palpably anchored in the "seventeen seconds" detail. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("too ethically diligent to grant herself...") rather than purely dramatized feeling, which distances the reader at the pivotal moment. The shift from guilt to absolution feels slightly diagrammatic due to this explicit filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is introspective and consistent, but her "blithe acceptance" renders her reaction to the climax somewhat flat and devoid of struggle. Her motivation follows an external instruction (the letter) rather than a desperate internal drive, limiting dramatic tension and agency.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is anchored by a compelling professional identity ("ignorance cartographer") that frames her worldview. However, the central internal conflict—her terror of the commission—dissolves through reflection rather than being tested by a high-pressure choice or visible sacrifice. The resolution feels earned by her philosophy but lacks a felt emotional or relational cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Helena’s backstory as a copyist provides a strong, specific grounding for her current method of resistance, elevating her beyond a generic rebel. However, her reaction to the patrol relies on a standard "fox" false-alarm beat that misses an opportunity to show unique character stress responses. The transition from internal doubt to resolve is summarized rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina's internal landscape is rendered with precision, balancing the weight of grief against the technical demands of her new role. The contradiction between her desire to "crystallize" emotion and the gallery's lesson that nothing can be kept provides a strong internal anchor. The moment she accepts the "partial truth" philosophy as a kindness rather than a deception marks a clear, earned character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; traits like "rationally rebellious" are told as labels rather than demonstrated through difficult action. Internal conflict is summarized ("agonized") instead of dramatized through active choices under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margaret’s internal state of expectant resignation is rendered with precision and empathy. However, Darius’s motivation relies heavily on a summarized backstory monologue ("Spent two years hating everyone...") rather than dramatized struggle in the present; his transformation occurs off-stage via the video, reducing the scene’s active character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maren is a romanticized archetype rather than a complex character; her motivations are delivered through summary ("tasted a grandmother's laughter") rather than dramatized internal friction. She faces no difficult contradictory impulses, acting with pure purpose that leaves little room for psychological depth or genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is defined primarily by her "involuntarily truthful" attribute, which functions more as a plot lubricant to bypass distrust than a character flaw generating friction. Her motivation to help is immediate and uncomplicated, lacking the internal contradiction or reluctance that creates depth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina is a distinct, contemplative presence, but her central epiphany feels intellectually asserted rather than emotionally earned under pressure. The pivotal realization—"understood in that moment that her grandmother had been wrong"—arrives instantly upon opening the door, lacking the resistance or struggle required to make the internal shift feel dramatic rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veris is a compelling focalizer, blending ancient stillness with active empathy. Mira's emotional arc—from defensive panic to acceptance—is functional but feels accelerated; her rapid surrender to the telepathic truth relies more on the magical mechanism than character resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s internal landscape is compelling, grounding the abstract premise in the specific ache of her father's death. The transition from valuing the die's "imperfection" to accepting its smoothness at the end effectively dramatizes an internal shift in her relationship with grief.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya is a consistent focalizer with a clear, label-driven motivation ("methodically hopeful"), but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses in the scene. Her transition from viewing insomnia as punishment to gift feels like a smooth, essayistic conclusion rather than a hard-won emotional shift under pressure. The characterization relies on "muscle memory" and magical competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s internal landscape is compelling, seamlessly blending her past as a curator with her present reality. The closure choice—adopting her "museum voice" to validate the child's bread as an artifact—is a brilliant, character-specific moment of earned stasis that shields the innocent while acknowledging the end. The emotional arc from despair to performative preservation is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alaric's obsession with "wrongness" and backward motion provides a robust, character-specific lens that justifies the surreal logic of the story. The internal motivation—grief sublimated into mechanics—is revealed with precise timing, earning the emotional weight of the climax without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera functions effectively as a vessel for the concept, but her internal arc is largely reactive; she follows instructions rather than driving the turning point through a difficult, defining choice. The shift from terror to "seduction" is enacted because she is told to do it, making the emotional pivot feel procedural rather than earned through internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is distinct and vividly drawn, with clear motivation rooted in the setting. However, the characterization remains somewhat static; she performs her competence without facing a moment of doubt, internal contradiction, or high-stakes choice that would reveal deeper layers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply embodied; the transition from passive recorder to active explorer is earned through the specific catalyst of the decoded message. The decision to leave represents a clear decisive change with legible emotional cost (leaving home and safety). The internal struggle between the comfort of the "lie" and the dread of not knowing drives agency effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vera's specific identity as a "fictional historian" drives a unique internal conflict between appreciating the forgery's craft and the moral duty to expose it. Her patience, demonstrated by the rosebush ritual, creates a distinct, disciplined characterization that elevates her beyond a generic whistleblower.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marina functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal life is conveyed through labeled summaries ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than dramatized struggle. Motivation is clear, but the lack of internal contradiction or flaw creates a static protagonist who faces no genuine psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren is a distinct and competent protagonist whose "tranquilly perceptive" nature drives agency and problem-solving. Motivation is clear and consistent, though the lack of significant internal conflict or emotional cost limits the character's depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's grief is stated through summary ("unbearable weight," "heart begged") rather than embodied in contradictory actions or resistance. The psychological shift at the end feels like a convenient authorial pivot rather than an earned evolution of character, lacking the internal friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Yara is a deeply realized focalizer with a specific, embodied response to trauma. The shift from the diagnostic "survivor's guilt" to the visceral sensation of "incompleteness" creates authentic interiority. The emotional cost of her obsession is palpable, though the mention of the therapist feels slightly expository compared to the strength of the immediate sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is a competent focalizer, but her journey lacks internal friction or difficult choices; she accepts the pilgrim and the revelation without skepticism or struggle. The trait "perpetually surprised" appears as a static label rather than a behavior that shapes tactics or complicates interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren's professional pivot is compelling, but the emotional climax relies on the stock "weeping for the first time since childhood" trope, which flattens the specific interiority of her guilt. The transition from concealer to revealer is earned, but the emotional release feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivation is clear and the internal struggle regarding the brother is well-rendered. However, the voices of Mira and Varen converge significantly; both speak in the same elevated, hyper-articulate register, reducing the sense of distinct personalities clashing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (competence vs. trauma) is clear and drives the narrative arc effectively. However, the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling and summary ("paralysis felt safer," "gap... insurmountable") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the visceral experience of her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    Marcus's internal transition from "terrible numbness" to "something true" happens too rapidly without sufficient dramatized struggle or contradiction. Elena functions primarily as an exposition delivery system, explaining the plot and theme rather than interacting through genuine, embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira's motivation is laser-focused and the cost she pays—her humanity—is viscerally enacted on the page, satisfying the closure requirement with high stakes. The internal conflict is slightly summarized ("had raged against it... resistance crumbled") rather than fully dramatized in the moment of decision, but the physical manifestation of that choice is compelling. The "beast whisperer" identity integrates well with the transformation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Morrigan's interiority is excellent, particularly the admission that she craved "rest or solitude" over motherhood in the moment; this creates a jagged, authentic emotional contradiction that elevates her beyond a stock archetype. The specific "onyx-ink" heritage informs her worldview without overwhelming her immediate, personal desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mei Lin is compellingly drawn, with the "gravitationally unburdened" trait acting as a physical manifestation of her emotional state. The internal conflict between her pacifist identity and buried rage is dramatized effectively through the stitching action, grounding the epiphany in physical behavior rather than just thought.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Miriam is a distinct, mythic presence with a consistent internal landscape. Her "destitute philanthropist" history is compelling, but the attribute of "orchestrating coincidences" is relegated to backstory rather than dramatized in the present scene. The emotional arc is clear, though her lack of hesitation in the final ritual lowers the sense of active struggle or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren is a competent focalizer, but she lacks internal friction; her decision to betray seventeen years of service is presented as a completed past conclusion rather than a live, on-page struggle. She functions primarily as a vehicle for the plot mechanics, executing a plan without encountering a character-testing obstacle or paying a visceral emotional cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Meren is a distinct focalizer with a compelling background, but her primary internal conflict—the fear of her curse—is resolved by an inventory item (star dust) rather than a difficult character choice. The cost of using the dust is stated (17 years) but feels transactional rather than emotional, reducing the weight of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elena’s internal landscape is vivid, and the connection between her father’s silence and her own is compelling. However, the pivotal shift relies on external permission (the note) rather than a purely internal conquest of fear, which slightly softens the agency of the climax. The emotional stakes are high, but the "cost" of speaking feels more atmospheric than immediate or dangerous in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions as a hyper-competent archetype rather than a nuanced character; her mechanical arm is "superior," and she decodes spies and fences ambassadors without visible struggle. The lack of internal friction or flaws lowers the stakes, as she feels protected by plot armor rather than human vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the bond with Ezra feels genuine and grounded in shared history. However, the "molting personalities" trait reads more like a declared label than an embodied psychological reality in the scene; while we are told she is "someone new" tonight, her actions and voice remain stable and indistinguishable from the backstory "Mira," missing a chance to dramatize the specific cost or shift of this month's persona.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with clear desire, but her primary trait ("strategically creative") feels inserted as a label to justify the plot rather than demonstrated through difficult choice. Her internal conflict is mild; the transition from grief to action is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine doubt or psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Yara's internal conflict between empirical training and heritage is compelling, grounding the magical elements in professional identity. The surrender of agency at the climax ("didn't remember planting it") fits the mystical logic but slightly softens the character's final decisive moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.0)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—dust on her palms, the orchid surviving in a cracked pot—yet the “strip needless drama” mandate stays verbal, never crystallizes into a visible micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The decision to pocket the slide is the closest to action, but it arrives without prior friction or forfeiture, so the arc leans contemplative rather than crucible-forged. Emotional stakes are felt, but no path is foreclosed; the ending’s humility is atmospheric, not paid for by a renunciation we witness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—yearning for beauty yet complicit in a dirty trade—arrives early and drives the ledger decoding. The embodied poison tremor/quick temperature adjustments link body to craft; the “pause” epiphany is earned because we have watched her test it against frost/ledger in real time. Cost is legible: she forfeits patron income and steps into uncertain self-commissions. Voice stays singular; no external status crucible but internal split suffices for single-POV default.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margaret’s grief-driven inventiveness is embodied and specific; the silent orchid-stem experiment makes her interior contradiction visible. The micro-choice to write the “gold” warmth of her own chest into notation shows earned change. No secondary character appears, so bullets 6-8 are waived; her solitude is the crucible. Cost is legible: she accepts a lifetime of external silence for an internal music only she can feel, a Charged Poise that forecloses audiophile return.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s refusal to discard the lens crystallizes his “inadvertently stubborn” trait into a vocation; the micro-choice to press his palm to the shard lets oceanic knowledge flood him, fusing trait to stakes. Interiority stays concrete: saltwater in lungs becomes coordinates, not a label. Final exhaustion feels earned because each burial costs him literal breath and sleep, visible in “weariness deepened.” Cap at 8.7 because no second on-page character pressures him; all status/relationship bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her grandmother’s coat pocket, the bell’s map of hands—yet the moment she hands the bell to Yusuf crystallizes her hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradiction between safety and heritage is dramatized, not declared. Yusuf’s skepticism supplies external pressure that forces her to articulate the cost of memory aloud, earning the final pocketing of the photograph. One hairline slip: “survival meant more than food” flirts with label-speak, but is immediately embodied by the bread-and-tea communion scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mei-Lin’s quiet certainty and the bodily cue of the trembling camera anchor her vocation; the monk memory arriving “three nights ago” is accepted without visible present-tense cost, so the interior contradiction stays thin. The micro-choice—offering the old woman the lens—carries gentle status inversion (artist→healer) and is enough renunciation to earn the ending’s poise. No secondary pressure from another on-page character, but the single-POY design meets scope. Interiority avoids label-speak, keeps idiosyncratic light-vision.

    <question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
    <comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration: the released breath sparks visibly ascend, charging the jasmine image and reweighting the “where unused love goes” question. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens: every beat adds luminous residue until the fog/jasmine matrix crystallizes it. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the camera’s next frame must now contain that absent light. One micro-turn (dark→luminous breath) is sufficient tightening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to escape retrocognitive collapse yet fearing the loss of self—drives every micro-choice; the final surrender is earned because the prose has shown her steady erosion of alternatives. Embodied emotion is vivid (“her teeth ache,” “memories shiver”), but one beat of diagnostic self-labeling (“retrocognitively trapped”) slightly blunts authenticity. The renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits corporeal continuity, paying with literal dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—terrorist label vs. farmer’s empathy—are dramatized in the scout standoff; the choice to spare her seeds the demolition cost and is paid for by the chains she still drags away. Interiority stays concrete (“chains… second skin,” “soil would be dry”). Final endurance (iron on wrists) makes cost legible. Slight reserve: scout’s interior is ventriloquised, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic color-hearing drives every micro-choice—and the embodied grief of “pressure from fathoms of water” lands. The moment she calibrates the device to her own fourteen-year-old voice is a credible, earned renunciation. Yet the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is only implicit; the loneliness is told more than tested under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s contradictory twin drives—thief’s nerve vs. mother-haunted idealist—collide in the pickpocket beat, her pulse against cold glass embodying both hunger and ethical correction. The micro-choice to palm the jar while handing over decoy paper crystallizes her hierarchy: freedom of light > personal safety > legality. Closure cost is felt: station clock chimes doom behind her, mother’s “presence” purchased with permanent exile from normal life. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; flaw (compulsion to steal beauty) drives the mistake of lingering to feel the glow, tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her theatrical self-narration externalizes solitude without lapsing into self-pity. The bookmark as inherited flaw/compass anchors her turn from isolation to risky community, and the red-light beat crystallizes a credibly costly choice. Still, the “contemplative glassblower” tag is asserted more than dramatized in craft-specific gestures; a single sensory beat of molten glass would have sealed the moniker. Emotional arc tracks cleanly, but the absence of a second on-page body limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—fear vs stunt training—and the final stand is embodied. Yet the “vulnerability is power” pivot is declared, not dramatized in body, trimming the felt cost. Still, micro-choices (shaking hands offered as weapon) keep motives coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s quiet obsession is credibly rooted in her tidal vocation and steadily embodied through her bloody ascent and patient map-making. Interior contradiction is thin—she never wavers or questions the quest—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-like. Still, her bleeding fingers and final smile sell the cost, earning a credible endurance that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Unit-7’s contradictory drives—janitor protocol vs. uploaded human wonder—are dramatized in the single gesture of setting down the broom and lifting the bow; the cost is the eternal loop it now knowingly carries. Interiority stays concrete (“snowflakes…another thought…could not quite trace”). The final endurance-sweep is earned: it accepts custodianship of seventeen silences, a visible forfeiture of escape. Only the absence of another on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s quiet-registrar past is shown through ritual return, lens habit, and eavesdrop skill; the gift of the lens externalizes her shift from observer to participant. Theo’s guilt and need to “translate” without words are embodied in the obsessive ticket-drawing; accepting the lens registers his acceptance of being seen. Both characters act under contradictory impulses—withdrawal vs. connection—until the mutual exchange crystallizes a new relational state at visible cost (she surrenders distance, he surrenders anonymity). Micro-choice hierarchy is legible; no stock interiority; change is proportionate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s quiet competence and outsider stance are well-drawn through tactile grease, scanner calibration, and her preference for machines and aliens over people. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and the final quiet triumph feels proportionate to her solitary labor. Yet the story withholds any micro-choice under real-time opposition; she merely records data she already believed, so the “earned cost” bar is only barely cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—obsession with the code versus the eerie calm she displays in waist-deep water—are rendered through concrete micro-choices (wading, photographing stains, prizing the oil-cloth packet). The final renunciation of lifelong invisibility carries visible cost: she forfeits her former anonymity by accepting the mantle of messenger. Interiority avoids cliché; the “wordless conversation” is shown via gesture and stance rather than label-speak. The only drag is an over-tidy calibration of emotion at the climax; the nod to Voss feels fractionally choreographed rather than stumbled into.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cassandra’s interior contradiction—certainty vs. probabilistic hedging—drives every beat; the swallowed-apocalypse choice is foreshadowed by her thumb on the smudge and lands with visible cost (“her own private weight”). The grandmother link and final refusal crystallize a hierarchy of values without tidy redemption. Minor slip: “oracle who could be wrong” is concept-stated, not yet embodied, in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in the asbestos-lung detail and the seventeen-year tunnel; the amber bead touch crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, but the “religiously skeptical” label is asserted more than dramatized. The final resolve is earned because every step deeper into the tunnel forfeits the comfort of the old run-away narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s renunciation of certainty and her embrace of witness-over-action is consistent and embodied; the final image of her “breathing back” the catacombs crystallizes a lifetime of micro-choices. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc leans contemplative rather than crucible-tested, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and embodied—touching the locket, adjusting her expression to give Maya room—yet her “softly adaptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The mother-daughter crucible is vivid, but the emotional stakes plateau; no contradictory impulse complicates Elena’s calm. The locket hand-off is a believable micro-choice, yet it merely extends her existing serenity rather than testing it. Closure lands as gentle stasis, not costly renunciation, so the arc feels circular rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid—“she simply listened to what the paper remembered”—but the shift from passive observer to axis-restorer is declared, not dramatized. The single micro-choice (wrapping the fragment) is too light to bear the climactic purpose; we are told the cost is “weight” but do not feel her body pay it.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured and specific—her “accidentally prophetic” guilt, the shift from ideological to human-scale service. Micro-choices (handing over the specs, writing the journalist’s fortune) crystallize values with visible cost. Flaw—three-decade stamina never tested on-page; we see no erosion or contradiction under pressure. Still, the final renunciation reads earned because the reflective block lands as a deliberate self-orchestrated break.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s calm, ritualized interrogation keeps his motive legible, but Elena’s interiority is filtered through his rhetoric; her moment of laughter-tears feels pre-scripted rather than embodied. The absence of a visible cost to Marcus (no falter, no sweat) keeps the stakes lopsided; the priest’s palette and pedal risk becoming clever props rather than crucible tools. Still, the pacing of micro-choices under the three-minute clock keeps the scene alive.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is lucid and character-specific—“chronologically homesick,” the shell-memory spiral—yet agency is mostly observational until the final decision to write the last fortune. The nautilus and notebook function as extensions of her mind, but the climb itself is curiously frictionless (no vertigo, no weather threat, no body failings) so the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. The earned renunciation lands cleanly, but because the physical ordeal never endangers her, the emotional price is attenuated.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is luminous: “She existed now in the space between the drop and the ripple” crystallizes her disorientation as lived sensation. Contradictory impulses—yearning for unity yet perpetually generating new selves—are dramatized in her decision to release the tablet, a micro-choice that costs her the fantasy of singularity. The arc lands in earned stasis: she accepts endless fragmentation, a renunciation felt in the final image of her rising again. No safety-hedging; flaws (compulsion to fragment) drive the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s embodied arc from frost to feeling is credibly anchored in the needle-and-drum beats; the “filament of hush” re-weighting at the end is earned. One hairline slip: “she understood now that…” explanation just before the cavern exit soft-pedals the cost that was already visible. Still, interior contradiction is dramatized, not declared, for most of the piece. Causality of emotional thaw is tracked through tactile vibration rather than therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “meticulous devotion” shown through seventeen years of storm logs—but the epiphany (“impossibility shifted beneath her”) is articulated rather than dramatized with bodily cost. The renunciation of immediate action is credible, yet the emotional contradiction between fear and scientific hunger could be sharper in-scene. Still, her flaws (naïve persistence, solitary risk) complicate the final stillness and foreclose the safe path.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s cautious, scent-avoidant nature is embodied in every beat: she waits, uncorks only when alone, cries without forcing explanation. The inherited aversion is dramatized, not labeled, and the final choice to keep the vial feels inevitable. Interior contradiction—yearning to know vs. fear of being swept away—stays live in scene. No stock therapeutic self-talk; cost is felt in tear-tracked cheeks and low-oil lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s tactile “reading” of objects as poems is vivid and idiosyncratic; the braided rope beats let contradictory impulses (terror / aliveness) thrum at once. Interiority seldom slides into label-speak, and micro-choice—handing the rope to the woman—crystallizes his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The flaw is mild over-articulation: four abstract “about” sentences in the grotto flatten embodied pressure. Still, the final renunciation of safety for textured time is earned by the rope’s prior pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is specific—"absence of what should have been there"—and the copper bowl anchors humility as a lived value. The micro-shift from resisting to listening inside the hush dramatizes contradiction; the final renunciation (imperfect music tomorrow) costs her the shelter of silence she just reclaimed. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV voice stays coherent. Emotional progression avoids tidy stages, landing in earned, wistful poise rather than cure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—numb dealer craving authentic feeling—drives every beat; the embodied “static electricity” gift and glycerin-drop detail keep her from abstraction. The final micro-choice (tucking the spent petal into amber) crystallizes her new permeability with visible cost. One slip: “affectionate detachment” is named, not dramatized, blunting the closing hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s curiosity-as-inheritance is clear, but the moment she decides to “throw her considerable influence” behind Elias is reported, not dramatized; we never see her broker-shrewdness in action under pressure. Interiority skews toward thematic summary (“strange electricity of inherited obligation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Earned stasis is credible, but the cost is stated, not felt in a micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veren’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers “never still,” her ache for pattern and belonging is shown through reed-forming micro-choices. The climactic recognition that she sought “being sought” is fully prepared by prior beats; the cost (she will stay, keep shaping, never return to marsh) is felt in the final image. Minor slip: Senna’s orphan backstory is delivered in a single explanatory line rather than discovered through action, nudging motivation toward label-speak for one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miriam’s interior contradiction—scientist’s caution versus grief-driven time-debt—drives every beat; the borrowed-months cost is felt in her trembling hands. Micro-choices (touching the cage, sitting exhausted) are embodied, not labeled. Final endurance (sketching the cadence) is earned by the prior causal chain of borrowing, uncaging, and hearing the echo. Voice remains individual, though “time is a loop” edges label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to equations of grief while refusing tidy binaries of presence/absence—survives the climax intact; the shift from “solve for Theo” to “solve for self” is earned by every prior micro-choice. Embodied emotion (glass eyes warming, orchard glow intensifying) keeps diagnostic language at bay. The renunciation carries visible cost: she pockets the mismatched eyes “finally at peace,” a tactile admission that ambiguity will stay nestled against her skin. Voice remains singular, never sliding into explanatory jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s invisible archivist persona is vivid and embodied; her tactile micro-choices (tracing pipes, caching relics, selecting the 1943 letter) reveal a hierarchy of values anchored to remembered love. The internal contradiction—wanting to stay unseen yet aching to transmit proof of existence—drives every on-page move and culminates in the renunciation of total invisibility. Cost is legible: she risks exposure by planting Eleanor’s letter, a tangible forfeiture of safety. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; solo arc fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete—her four-decade vocation, the bark-like patches she hides, the silent breakfast strikes—and the metamorphosis is embodied rather than diagnosed. The single contradiction (“I must control / I must surrender”) drives her final stance, so the arc is earned. Micro-choices (pressing the leaf to her chest, baring her feet to moss) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Voice specificity slips only once with “greenish tint” cliché, but overall she feels lived-in and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s insomnia and compulsive painting are vividly embodied; the barefoot walk across the causeway crystallizes her need. Internal contradiction—yearning for meaning while doubting its existence—stays active in scene. The final choice to share work with Theo costs her solitary ritual, yet the beat is slightly under-dramatized; we see the offer, not the relinquishment. Still, motives remain particular and consistent, earning the shift from isolation to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her sudden blindness to the future is embodied in the pilgrim’s blood-map and her own racing pulse. The moment she chooses the pearl, the cost is felt: “She wept… she had missed the miracles breathing in every ordinary second.” Yet the arc leans toward epiphany rather than contradiction; the final smile is earned but not deeply scarred.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s vocation and exile motive are crisp, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in scene; the single on-page choice—returning to the desk—carries no visible trade-off or risk, so the “earned” stasis feels lightly purchased. The emotional cost is asserted (“she could not change what had been lost”) rather than embodied in a moment of friction. Micro-choices under pressure are missing; all key beats happen in summary while she handles objects.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara's interiority is concrete—her compulsive watch-checking, the tactile weight of the phantom punch, her mapper's eye for contour lines—yet the emotional ledger still tilts toward summary ("thirty years of silence") rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. The climactic choice to step through the door is foreshadowed by her steady abandonment of measurement for intuition, but the cost (identity as cartographer) is named more than felt. The father is too spectral to serve as a crucible; Clara's risk is real, but the relational pressure is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her bone-deep vibration from whale song and the “smell of their mother’s garden after rain” flash are embodied. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. desperate hope) play simultaneously in scene, not summary. The final micro-choice—descend with journal pressed to heart—crystallizes her value hierarchy and earned endurance. Minor slip: “sympathetic skeptic” is declared once rather than dramatized through prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s boredom and the longing for Maricel are vivid, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“profoundly, achingly bored”). Micro-choice is present—she starts the mutiny with words—but the causal leap from observer to conspirator is compressed; we see no moment where her own risk or guilt is embodied. The final renunciation lands because the fragment burns, but the cost to her is told (“calcified soul began to crack”) rather than felt in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s never-lie trait is embodied in micro-choices (the single-word answer “No,” the insistence on “I chose”), and her contradictory hunger for clean transactions collides with the moment she accepts the weighted ink pot; the final endurance—carrying stolen history home—pays the cost of her father’s flaws in visible silence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mei’s monastic ritual of charting lamp-hums is a compelling, idiosyncratic obsession that drives every action; her interior contradiction—collecting intangible dawns to sell as tangible paper—peaks when she tastes “ash and wedding cake” and still keeps climbing. The inherited compulsion arrives fully motivated, but the story never tests her commitment with a live temptation or visible forfeiture; closure is a quiet reiteration rather than a cost-bearing renunciation. Micro-choices (opening the notepad, tracing the spine) are concrete, yet they do not narrow her future or foreclose a path. Earned Stasis is present, but the price feels abstract—she simply descends again—so the arc hovers just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nameless woman’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes-scaled: her fingers “trailing rust and salt,” the glass-pressed label as tactile relic, the decision to “breathe with the tide.” Contradictory impulses (grief vs. vengeance, erasure vs. witness) co-exist in-scene rather than in summary. The only micro-slip is a touch of diagnostic self-tag (“she had learned to filter reality differently”) that momentarily abstracts what the body is already dramatizing; it keeps her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s armor-as-skepticism is vivid; the seashell tug and cello-induced collapse are embodied. The shift from myth-buster to listener lands with cost—she descends changed, shell to ear, recorder forgone. One interior contradiction beats: “This is acoustics” while grief floods—enough for this length. Flaw: the father line arrives late, so the cost feels slightly imported rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressed it between her fingers… stomach clench”), but the dual-allegiance tension is asserted more than dramatized; the Marinero elders’ refusal is reported, not shown forcing a micro-choice. The closing smile feels unearned after a night of summarized, not sceneworked, negotiation. Competent but not yet crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s grief-motivated quest plus the hourglass talisman give her interiority traction; the “purposefully curious” trait is asserted, never shown complicating a live decision under pressure. The final stance is a credible renunciation, but we get only one micro-choice—setting the camera—so the cost feels light for 780 words. Still, her voicing of loss stays consistent and specific enough to feel individual rather than archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her haptic, thermal, and sonic world feels lived-in, and her micro-choices (testing rotors by ear, bonding the lens) manifest a hierarchy of values. Blindness is never a gimmick; it constrains and enables real tactics. The “magnetic calm” is credible as practiced poise under deadline, not superpower. Flaw: no contradictory impulse visible in-scene; she never doubts or misreads, so the arc is flat—steady competence rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s contradictory mix of cartographic rigor and emotional abandonment is dramatized: her red-pen atlas corrections versus the silence of wife and daughter, both given embodied weight in the same breath. The micro-choice to draw the falcon’s condensation-route on the glass turns abstract obsession into tactile action. Final “Earned Stasis” renunciation—walking onto ice that may kill her—pays the accumulated cost of every prior map-lie. Minor slip: “competence had never been enough to make her lovable” drifts toward diagnostic summary; still, interior contradiction is otherwise viscerally shown.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bell tuner’s near-silence and ritual precision make her an enigma rather than a psyche, yet her immutable patience and the micro-choice of pressing the fork into the elder’s hand crystallize a believable, mythic resolve. Interior contradiction is faint because she is written as force, not person, but the cost is legible: she gives away her last tool and walks on, forever unpaid. That single gesture earns the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—scientist’s hunger for proof vs. reverent witness—are dramatized in the fingertip choice to release, not seize, the memory knot. The micro-choice to empty then refill the vial crystallizes her arc with visible cost (forfeited evidence, dwindling O₂). The dead diver’s earlier paralysis supplies an effective foil that sharpens her stakes without dialogue. Interiority stays concrete, but a few phrases (“lifetime of proof,” “lonesome splendor”) flirt with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo’s need to redeem his father’s name by becoming the first “wolf-cryer” who is believed is clear and personal, but the interiority stays slightly abstract (“stood trembling,” “he thought”) rather than giving us a visceral contradiction inside the confessional. The single moment of embodied cost—gripping the lattice until it cracks—does land, but it comes late; earlier beats summarize emotion rather than dramatize it. The final renunciation (walking toward patrol with proof) is credible, yet the micro-choices that earn it are more declared than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s inherited duty and quiet awe feel lived-in; his micro-choice to press the bead into soil crystallizes generations of obligation. Maren’s single spoken line carries a century of fatigue and hope, making her more than backstory. Interiority stays concrete—“mournful elation in his chest was almost too vast to bear” gives visceral scale without label-speak. The cost is visible: the greenhouse cracks, dawn arrives, the family line is freed—an earned renunciation rather than tidy triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Meren’s interiority is evocative—her memories of grandmother and mother braid with present action—but the “decision” to weave the paths is front-loaded as inherited destiny rather than a visible micro-choice under pressure. The bone needle and hair thread are tactile anchors, yet their procurement and meaning are summarized, not dramatized, softening the felt cost. Still, her stance crystallizes in the final image, and the contradiction between tradition and mercy is embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s contradiction—skeptic arriving to debunk, then volunteering to resurrect the orchard—drives every beat. Her embodied awe (“breath caught… warmly curious wonder”) and tactile micro-choices (shaping the gnomon, pocketing seeds) keep interiority concrete. The cost is legible: she abandons her original excavation goal, straps the broken dial to her pack, and accepts the burden of starting new pilgrimages. Only minor slip: the inherited map and maternal retreat are recounted more than dramatized, blunting the full sting of familial failure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s quiet, ritualized competence is vivid; her refusal of digital tools and the wax seal embody her creed. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final “cost” is the perpetual return to dawn vigil—an earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s “vacant sweetness” masquerade is vividthrough micro-choice—thread-spill as pick-pocket, corner-crawl eavesdropping—and her interior contradiction (trembling awe vs. cold cartography) stays embodied. The grandmother hand-off and eternal flame inheritance seed motive, but the leap to “three days to save the Queen” is asserted, not dramatized; cost is promised rather than felt. Because the final stance (smiling fool, needle moving) repeats the opening mask, we get Charged Poise, yet the absence of an on-page failure or irreversible sacrifice caps emotional depth. Secondary officers exist only as gossip clusters, so relationship crucible and status shift bullets are N/A—single-POV handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while craving absolution—are dramatized in the tactile ritual of pocketing the shard and the final press to her lips. The apology’s twenty-year inertia and the instant of its release are credibly linked by the moonlit condensation beat. Cost is visible: the word “Mama” is paid for with prior bodily and moral pressure. Interiority stays concrete; only the phrase “twenty years of silence crack inside her like ice in spring thaw” flirts with label-speak, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s interiority stays concrete—she names languages, reefs, shrapnel—and her fear of “telling stories that hurt people because I got the words twisted” crystallizes a translator’s occupational dread. The micro-choice to soften “the boats are coming” into “the boats brought help” is a visible, merciful edit that costs her professional exactness. The girl’s shrewd innocence is shown through her unsolicited confession and spontaneous trust; both characters display contradictory impulses simultaneously rather than alternating summaries. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: she accepts the price of imperfect memory-keeping and walks toward surgery lighter, the coral now discardable.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—she “paints with light” to reclaim joy lost to commerce—and her embodied emotions (the fresco warming in her pocket, the involuntary laugh) anchor the arc. The contradiction between paid commercial work and this secret nocturnal art drives every micro-choice; each luminous stroke is a renunciation of corporate drudgery with felt cost (time, secrecy, spirit). Earned Stasis lands cleanly: she commits to return nightly, joy re-practiced, path foreclosed. Minor gap: we get no back-remembered instance of past corporate gigs to texture the wound, but the ache is still palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus’s rogue-scholar charisma and curiosity are vividly present, but Sofia remains largely functional—her interiority is sketched only to facilitate exposition. Their shared decision to plant is credible, yet the emotional cost is collective rather than individually textured. The earned stasis (they commit to a long game whose price is deferred) is consistent with the premise but feels slightly safe; a sharper personal stake would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minerva’s insomnia and grief-rooted drive to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are concrete and embodied; the interior contradiction between shyness and unstoppable compulsion is dramatized through the nightly lullaby ritual and the accumulating poems. The final endurance—another lullaby, another line of light—earns its cost by the centuries of visible labor on the walls. The only bar to 9-band is that the moment of deepest interior fracture (mother’s face / bombing) is recalled rather than enacted, so the primal wound is asserted, not simultaneously felt and resisted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive—to recover extinct names—remains vivid and embodied; the cracked bamboo tube as proxy for her daughter’s lost syllables externalizes the ache. Interiority is concrete (“shape of it in her mouth…spring rain and copper pennies”) and her gently systematic ritual gives consistent micro-choice. Emotional arc moves from solitary tending to tearful, earned release, but no second character or status shift means no crucible test; the cost is felt yet internal, not relational.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid and character-specific; the contradiction between her scholarly precision and raw sibling guilt is embodied in the tremor she feels against the stone wall and the “inadequate vessels” of her first words. The micro-choice to confess blame aloud is credible and scales the cost to the word-limit. Elias’s mirrored admission supplies parity, yet his interior access is only inferred, keeping the single-POV contract. A hairline slip: her epiphany that truth is “simply resonance” edges toward editorial abstraction at the very moment of peak vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; the trembling hands, chain-clink, and tear-streaked face embody contradiction between inherited guilt and new knowledge. The final renunciation—silence chosen again, now knowingly—pays the cost of her grandmother’s disgrace forward, earned by the decoded letter and her own calibrated resolve. No stock labels; every emotional beat is filtered through machinist perception of living stone and sleeping giants. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory hindsight in “she understood now,” but it is immediately grounded in tactile memory.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s reinvention-from-pigeon-trainer is vivid, but the “learned to love decay and possibility” beat is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is present (guilt vs. need for silence) yet never crystallizes in a high-cost micro-choice; the confession to Mira is low-stakes because Mira has no opposing desire. Earned stasis is credible but feels moderate; the meteorite-as-mirror works, yet the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Wren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to exile yet yearning for return—are dramatized in the tactile handling of logbook and oak grain; the final step through violet threshold is earned by seventeen years of micro-choices that cost her the safety of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The father’s off-page reawakening is felt as a visceral tremor in her body, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is textured—her sense of exile is embodied in the “hollow rituals of colleagues who never made room.” She acts: she descends with the case, kneels, offers the feather, chooses to stay until sunrise. One contradiction drives the arc: she flees human company yet craves belonging; this conflict is kept alive by the quiet gamble of sharing breath at the window. The micro-choice to exhale in sync crystallizes a hierarchy of values (connection over academic prestige) with visible cost (she will resurface alone, carrying only an address).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief vs wonder, need to know vs need to accept—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (pressing seeds to glass, planting them). The final renunciation lands because the text has tied her identity as recollectionist to the act of transliterating her own grief; cost is visible in the laugh-cry echo. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Flaw: the sister remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is theoretical, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s motives—inheritance of her father’s puzzle-mind filtered through musical obsession—are legible and consistent. The embodied emotion is mostly filtered through precise spatial noticing rather than visceral contradiction, so interiority feels coolly analytical, not contradictory. The micro-choice to weave the child’s laughter into the cadenza shows her hierarchy of values, but the moment is summarized rather than dramatized with cost. Closure offers an earned renunciation: she accepts that tomorrow’s randomness will erase tonight’s calculations, a visible forfeiture of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selene’s contradictory mix of custodial mentor and exiled outlaw is repeatedly embodied—her bare feet press “silent against the cold stones,” she both shields and endangers Kira. Kira’s hunger and hollowed memory are shown through her whispered request and steady extended arm, not labels. The final shared dance crystallizes their mutual cost: Selene surrenders her monopoly on exile, Kiranever belongs to the provinces again. Minor softness: Kira’s “first true smile” edges close to performed emotion; still, micro-choices (arm extended, trembling after inscription) keep motivation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—cuts on her hands, the stone’s weight, the fisherman’s laugh—but the moment of “renunciation” is pure conceptual assertion (“moments… could not be demolished”). No embodied cost is staged; the decision to scatter new glass is announced, not dramatized with contradiction or price. The micro-choice of throwing the stone is evocative yet changes nothing in her tactics; the final sketch is consequence-free. Character therefore hovers in strong observational territory without the felt friction that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s grief is rendered through embodied particulars—burn scars catching moonlight like “rivers of melted wax,” the cracked box pressed to his chest—so interiority stays concrete. The contradictory impulse to scatter yet hoard ashes crystallizes in the final beat, earning the renunciation. Micro-choices (tracing the crack, opening the pouch, tucking the empty box back inside his jacket) visibly manifest the hierarchy of values: memory over release, imperfection over wholeness. All flaws and limits are on-page and compel the final climb-down; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. bereft mother—is vivid, embodied in trembling palms on brass. The lucid-watchful trait enables the grotto experiment, but the shift from passive observation to “tomorrow she would contact Geneva” is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; micro-choice is summary, not beat. Grandmother memory supplies motive yet stays reflective, never forcing an on-page mistake or trade-off. Emotional hierarchy is clear; still, the arc lands in assertion, not compelled action with price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s perceptual gift is dramatized in the first beat—palpating stone for “echo fossils”—and every later choice (abandoning sensors, pocketing Helena’s negative, pressing the wall again) flows from that trait. Interiority stays concrete and biased; the impulse to “give walls voice” is tested against the discovery that they already possess one, producing a micro-cost in humility rather than a declarative epiphany. The only cap is slight: no interior contradiction shown at the climax; she simply receives the legacy. Still, the lens is Accumulative and the stance crystallizes, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter’s interiority is lyrically anchored in bodily perception (“her hands moved with perceptive calm”) and her heartbeat-borrowing secret is dramatized, but we never feel a genuine internal contradiction or moment of risk; the calm stays too smooth, so the micro-choice that could foreclose a path remains off-stage. Earned endurance is present (she leaves no signature, vanishes into dusk) yet the cost is poetic rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the ebony clipboard as inherited burden anchors her contradictory impulses. The decision to admit “you cannot” trust peace but to sign anyway crystallizes her earned stasis with visible cost. Flaws (exhaustion, habitual gentleness) complicate rather than decorate. Missing 9.0 only because the General and Marshmother remain slightly emblematic, their grief stated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s warring impulses—world-saving calculus vs. the dodo-egg ache—are embodied in salt crusting her knees; the “mathematics of mercy” line crystallizes the contradiction. Her final kneel-and-release is a micro-choice that costs the last sentimental scrap she denied for decades, earned by the causal chain of drought, guilt, and salt. Flaw works: the same hand that poisoned rivers now lifts bird song into stone. No other character on stage, so relationship bullet waived; headcount clear.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Meridia’s refusal to sell her body is a sharp, embodied contradiction that drives every beat; her choice to harvest the echoes is the natural culmination of that stance. The “army she carried within her” moment crystallizes a credible, earned inheritance rather than an epiphany. Interiority stays specific and sensorial, though a few phrases (“architecture of boundaries”) flirt with abstraction. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of anonymity and steps into the role of teacher—visible, targeted, but finally whole.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific—calligrapher turned puppeteer, guilt-tinged pragmatism—and his contradictory impulse (manipulate to enlighten) is active in every beat. Vera’s shift from accusation to tear-streaked request is embodied, not declared. Their joint mark in the dust crystallizes a shared, costly微型 choice under the dome’s echo. Only minor slack: “uncommonly serene” is label-adjacent before it’s dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s grief-propelled ritualism is viscerally embodied; the moth-wing relic and rope-knot language make her refusal to let the species vanish tangible. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—yet the lone on-page choice (building then dismantling the frames) costs her the last physical trace of grandmother. The cap at 8.7 reflects no contradictory impulse in-scene; renunciation is earned but micro-choices are sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thumb on the wax, breath on her hands—yet the “letting go” beat is declared more than dramatized. The final stance (she will hum, cast again) crystallizes, but the cost of releasing guilt is told in summary rather than paid in a visible micro-choice. Still, her perceptual signature and layered grief carry the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“her fingers tracing the Latin,” “hands trembled”—and her contradictory impulses (hunger for paths vs. refusal to master them) coexist in-scene. The final renunciation is earned: she pays the cost of permanent uncertainty, foreclosing the scientists’ hubris. Micro-choices (cracking the seal, climbing out) visibly enact her hierarchy of values. No stock diagnostic labels; voice stays specific and sensorily grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—frugality as spiritual discipline, the silent bargain she strikes with the unknown—yet her contradictory impulses (rationalist/seeker) stay mostly in summary rather than being forced into a single pressured choice. The moment she lifts the tile is the only concrete micro-choice that visibly costs her something (she pockets a three-coin relic that could be confiscated), so the covenant feels earned. Still, the “epiphany” is articulated rather than dramatized in body, keeping her just shy of full-spectrum embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thorne’s interiority is vivid—grief carved into his clenched fists, the “second skeleton” of resentment—while Mireva’s paradoxical pacifist-schemer trait is shown through tactile manipulation rather than label. The cellular-memory awakening is dramatized by the guided finger-tracing of broken pins, a micro-choice that re-weights his stance. The final unclenching is earned because the story has let us feel the cost of either clinging or releasing. Only the brief “scheming pacifist” label keeps this from perfect; the rest is embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s seventeen-year insomnia, mirror-craft, and final refusal to cross immediately are believable and rooted in her artisan patience. Interiority is concrete—breath-matching the fog, feeling glass spires in reflection—without label-speak. The micro-choice to break synchronization at the climax shows contradictory impulses (yearning vs. discipline) and costs her instant transcendence, earning the renunciation. Secondary character is absent, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s grief-driven resolve and Petra’s brittle eagerness are crisply embodied; the ribbon hand-off crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior contradiction is light—Mira’s “laugh” arrives abruptly but doesn’t undercut the stakes. Relationship as crucible works: the climbing banter forces Mira to recommit to teaching under pressure. A hairline slip: Petra’s “fuzzy eye” complaint is diagnostic shorthand, but it’s brief enough to avoid full penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid (“brightened disquiet”), her micro-choice to carve the cameo blank crystallizes the arc, and the retroactive self-curatorship gives her a concrete, costly identity shift. Emotional embodiment is strong; only minor gap is that the early “bewildered” label isn’t tested in an observable mistake before comprehension arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her leap from treating the mountain as obstacle to wounded guardian is embodied in the shift from decoding roots to speaking them. The “language of growing things” moment crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation of extraction for reciprocity. Thessaly’s re-appearance is slightly under-motivated (no on-page sign she can leave until she does), muting the emotional payoff. Still, the protagonist’s flaw—intellectual colonialism—drives the mistake and its repair, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite that late wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—longing to remember vs. fear of what that memory will cost—stay active in scene; the sister’s parallel desire to forget is shown, not told. Micro-choices (climbing the carousel, gripping mist-like hand, deciding to speak invented memories) are concrete and charged. The final renunciation of erasure is earned because every beat links back to the emerald cue and shared name. Only the grandmother’s “trembling fingers” label skirts diagnostic shorthand, but it is brief and offset by embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s “adaptable warmth” is shown through tactile, patient braid-work that visibly costs her calm; the final smile registers earned change. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers moved…with practiced patience”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the grandmother net memory is told, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s interiority is tactile and profession-specific; every micro-choice (kneeling to read ice cracks, pressing palms to walls) grows from her mapkeeper identity. Her body’s obsolete “ripple-marks” externalize the central loss and charge the final mapping act with earned cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ test narrowly misses.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation to decipher the prism and relight the beacon is legible, but her interiority defaults to lyrical paraphrase (“thistle-blown hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive act of relighting is earned, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized—no moment of visible renunciation or failure scars her. Vera’s posthumous presence supplies pressure, but because she is off-page, the relationship crucible is absent and secondary pressure collapses to memory. Still, micro-choices (touching the prism, neglecting the flame, running to the tower) track coherently and carry the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her need to preserve memory while destroying its certainty—drives every beat; the summer-quill quivering “with her heartbeat” embodies emotion under pressure. Her micro-choices (ascending the last steps, touching stone, speaking the conjecture aloud) all enact the same fault-line: certainty vs. honest multiplicity. The climactic renunciation—deciding to “sculpt” rather than inherit identity—carries unmistakable social cost: her people’s stories will lose their sheltering myth. The only minor drag is a half-sentence of diagnostic speak (“This was the problem with collective memory…”) that momentarily abstracts what the body and objects have already shown.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara descending with pages that will dissolve ancestral certainties reweights the entire rule-set of her culture at undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph (memory as sediment, palimpsest) and held cleanly through the charged poise of the last line. Causality is intact: every shadow contradiction she voices is earned by the physical evidence the monuments give. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors arrive within the first 80 words and the taught pattern of layered memory pays off in the final reconfiguration.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is not backdrop; its charged brass instruments and solidified fog physically trap Elara above the contested past, forcing her conjecture. The crystal forecourt vibrates through stone into her fingertips, turning “setting” into a live feed of ancestral voices that constrains her decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate: spiral stairs, shadow dial, aperture are tracked without drift. Micro-setting (summer-quill pages trembling against storm-charged air) supplies the final image’s texture. Weather is causal: the dawn-lit fog floor times her descent and marks the irrevocable public moment she carries down.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. usable myth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when shadow readings contradict; each monument’s refusal to cohere narrows her options from archivist-guardian to myth-sculptor. The decisive cost is legible: she forfeits the comfort of inherited certainty and accepts the collective rage that awaits below. Escalation is textural/accumulative; no external antagonist is needed because the contradictions themselves accumulate pressure until she must either falsify or re-sculpt. The final image crystallizes her stance without softening the stakes.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete problem of irreconcilable shadows, not from thesis statements; the story’s answer is the act of carving rather than any moral. Subtext lives in silence—the hush after thunder is also the hush of a culture about to lose its single past. The final line offers Charged Poise: identity “they had chosen rather than inherited” reweights every prior mention of preservation. No late sermon; the only overt reflection is Elara’s self-diagnosis, already quoted and dwarfed by the embodied cost she carries downstairs.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Elara’s professional eye (shadow lengths, quill vibration) without ventriloquizing ancestors. Syntax grows slightly clausal under pressure—“the deepening hush…thickened around her words”—mirroring her faltering breath. Diction stays within an archivist’s lexicon; no corporate register drift. The single POV never slips; collective memory is felt, not omnisciently asserted. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for ascent, clipped fragments for contradictory shadows, then open cadence for dawn descent.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“solidified into something resembling pale marble” anchors place, stakes, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or emotional data. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors in 800 words, each tied to material (quill-feather, marble fog, clay of memory). Clean grammar and tense; pronoun “she” always clear. Minor filter verb cluster (“she could sense its resonance”) but immediately redeemed by tactile follow-through. Final line is sharp, image-driven, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-numbed caution versus pyrotechnic daring—are shown in scene through her trembling hands yet daring fuse order; the final choice to keep the singed knot carries visible cost. Grandmother’s return functions as crucible pressure, forcing explicit renunciation of solitude. Micro-choices (humming while loading shells, crouching to decode tile shards) reveal value hierarchy: memory < spectacle < shared wonder. Motive intensifies cleanly: arrival hoping to feel → tower asked to transform grief → dawn carrying fire onward; no stock interiority or label-speak under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's interiority is rich and character-specific, her scientific detachment colliding with maternal guilt in real time. The jade cicada acts as a tangible pressure point that forces her to articulate a flaw she has never voiced. Elena's micro-shift from accusation to curiosity is credibly understated, not tidy. What keeps this from 9-band is that Elena's final overture—“teach me”—is slightly too neat a crystallization given the decades of damage; the cost is felt but not yet paid on her side.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s buried panic versus her hunger for open silence is embodied in every breath and micro-choice; the porcelain doll’s weight against her hip is a tactile proxy for interior pressure. The final beat—“she would grow like the crystalline vines”—crystallizes an earned shift from bunker-trained contraction to sideways, light-leaning expansion, and the cost (leaving father’s tomb unvisited) is felt without exposition. Interiority never slips into therapy-speak; instead, pulse and vertigo carry the stakes. The only drag is a slight over-recycling of “silence tasted like…” phrasing, but it never flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eris’s embodied grief—tuned to cable thrum and vial swirl—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she opens the vial she risks the last tangible shard of Mira, a palpable cost. Interiority stays sensory, never diagnostic. The only drag is a slight over-calibration of competence—seventeen flawless years can dull the sense of ongoing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Meridia’s interiority is precise—“she had never imagined herself a ruler”—and her micro-choice to climb anyway crystallizes her contradiction. The embodied cost is legible: sixty-four-year-old knees on phantom stairs, ruby flake dissolving into her skin. No stock phrases; every thought is filtered through a cataloguer’s trained attention to pigment and circuitry. The final renunciation of power for story-keeping lands as earned stasis because her earlier caution foreshadows it.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guarding her emptiness yet polishing the ring weekly—are dramatized in body and ritual, not told. The final choice to open the door is prepared by that ritual and by the shared scar logic, so the cost of letting the threshold dissolve feels earned. Sera remains slightly less individuated, her dialogue edging toward therapeutic shorthand (“I’m suffocating”), which blunts the relational crucible. Still, Mira’s micro-choices visibly foreclose her three-year solitude and the interior contradiction holds to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s survivor-guilt and self-revenge motive stay vivid; her micro-choice to grip the bolt while parallel selves crash over her is concrete and embodied. The “mischievous charity” label is slightly diagnostic, but the embodied pressure of channeling multiverse weight into diamonds keeps contradiction alive. Final renunciation—selling the diamonds to fund her subversive farm—pays off prior causality with visible cost, satisfying earned change. Interior voice never drifts into therapy-speak; scars and calloused hands ground her history in present sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret’s interior contradiction—yearning for legacy yet recoiling from its cost—remains embodied in the crank handle’s weight and the silent tears. The micro-choice to keep turning the empty platter externalizes her willingness to hear what ancestors denied. Cost is legible: she forfeits the comfort of inherited myth and accepts the burden of reparative silence. One decimal off 9+ only because the grandmother’s “eloquent silence” is asserted more than dramatized in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aldric’s interiority is vivid—armor dropping beat-by-beat embodies surrender—but the turn from doubt to vesselhood is declared more than dramatized; the blank-program page erase feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—dust-reading as scripture, the “tenderness unfurling” after Marcus—and her decision to re-archive the button rather than claim it crystallizes her renunciation with cost. The 1867 clerk and Thomas remain off-page, so status/relationship tests are waived; solo-POV rules apply and she passes. No contradictory impulses are staged in live scene: the beat is solitary, reflective, so the 9+ quick test fails by hairline. Still, the embodied emotion and earned stasis are strong enough for low-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s quiet-opposition persona is credibly seeded, but we never see interior contradiction under pressure—every move proceeds smoothly from plan. The grandmother key cue is the only moment where emotion might fracture composure, yet it’s summarized, not dramatized. Because the raid compresses all risk into off-stage explosion and unseen upload, the visible cost on Mira herself is missing; her reappearance feels competence-heavy rather than endurance-paid.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The saxophonist’s interiority is concrete—her breath, the dew on brass, the rising prophecy in her throat—and her renunciation of motherhood is foreshadowed and paid for. The “vested hush” technique is dramatized through micro-choices (note-by-absence playing) rather than exposition. Still, the grandmother/mother backstory is delivered in two expository blocks that slightly flatten contradictory impulses; the final silence is earned but the generational trauma feels summarized rather than lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Wren’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “moved with practiced precision,” her need to believe is embodied, and her final shift is traced through tactile contact with the moonstone dust. The because/therefore chain holds: decades of seed-sorting → pattern recognition → moonstone fusion → new sight. Cost is felt: she loses her old categorical certainty (“edges blur”) and pays with lifelong solitude now re-seen as vocation. Slight undershoot: we learn nothing she does not, but her prior loneliness is told more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her hands touching the brass, the weight of the satchel, the decision to dig with a gear-puller. The contradiction between lifelong precision and her dawning surrender to uncertainty is dramatized, not stated. No epiphany is over-articulated; the final stance is earned by the underground ordeal and the compass’s refusal to fix north. Micro-choices (digging, lifting the compass, choosing to read the logbook) visibly fork her path.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—she measures with “careful precision,” speaks aloud to her dead father, and the trembling heart under steady hands shows embodied contradiction. The flaw-to-golden-seam arc is credibly powered by fifteen off-page years, but the on-page micro-choices are few: only the decision to use the coin and the final walk-out carry visible cost. The shift from crushing shame to open-carry legacy is legible, yet the story tells us “she understood” twice rather than dramatizing the exact instant the weight flips. Still, the kintsugi metaphor shapes her worldview distinctively and the endurance leaves a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—centuries of duty versus her own identity erosion—are kept alive in every beat; the moment she touches the harp, memory and self-doubt collide in one concrete micro-choice. Her body registers cost (tears, the warming tooth) rather than diagnostic labels. The only bar to 9.0 is that the final self-reconciliation is slightly foreshadow-light; we see the ache but not a prior explicit scene where she doubts her laughter-bridge method.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—“her enhanced nervous system screaming”—and her micro-choice to trace equations in the soil crystallizes her turn from victim to agent. The contradictory impulse to bury the mask strap while still feeling its bite shows credible, costed change. Motive trajectory is cleanly traced: actuary → interrogated variable → forest coder of mercy. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority sustains pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive is cleanly legible—complete her grandmother’s archival work—yet interiority stays at a lyrical remove (“something she could not name”). Embodied emotion is strongest when she hesitates before the lens fragment, a micro-choice that crystallizes inheritance as duty. The final assent to “her true work” reads as earned renunciation of an ordinary life. More contradiction inside individual beats would push this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Miriam’s interiority is consistently concrete—her “skillfully observant” trait is shown through tactile detail like feeling the seam of the baseboard. The mainspring decision is earned via her established call to “discover what ceilings hide,” so the moment carries cost. The ghost’s backstory is summarized rather than embodied, keeping Eleanor abstract; this flattens the relational crucible. Still, Miriam’s micro-choice to carry the barrel out “heavy in her arms” crystallizes her stance, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maren’s occupation-driven perceptual signature is vivid—ink under nails, frost as text—but her interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“perfect systems were prisons”). The final micro-choice (pulling the lever) is telegraphed rather than wrestled with; we see no contradictory impulse in scene, so the renunciation feels pre-decided. Still, her hierarchy of values (imperfection > eternity) is legible and pays a visible cost when the press dissolves into light.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—ex-revolutionary hunger versus scholarly remove—stays alive in every micro-choice (uncovering the mirror, pressing the shard to glass). The shift from cataloguer to participant is earned: her revolutionary fire is re-kindled by the temporal sight of her younger self and the civilization mid-departure. Embodied emotion is strong (“crystal shard pulsed in her palm like a heartbeat remembering itself”). Cost is visible: she forfeits academic safety and corporeal continuity. Only flaw: the moment of stepping through is summarized, not dramatized, so the final micro-choice feels slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s vocation and grief are concrete; the moment he spots his self-serving wish to resurrect Grandmother, contradictory impulses collide on the page and the choice to renounce that hope costs him something palpable. Interiority stays sensory (“wilting” chest) rather than diagnostic. The micro-choice to apologise to the chip crystallises values under pressure, earning the lighter-than-years beat at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—her gloved fingers, the compass pulling “behind her sternum,” the hush that “felt less like absence and more like presence.” The hinge between rational curiosity and surrendered awe is dramatized in the spinning compass and her choice to stay; the cost (no way back) is legible in the final “she was simply no longer looking.” Minor slip: “determined” is a touch diagnostic; still, the contradiction between collector-control and mystic-yield is on-page and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—rational artist vs. inheritor of mystic duty—remains embodied and specific; the moment she presses the slide to lightning her body choice crystallizes the alliance stake. Flaw is minimal: “mechanical lullaby” drifts toward label-speak in the final beat, a hair below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her chest-carried “stone” and pre-dawn vigils give us embodied want. The contradiction between public acclaim and private incompleteness stays active; each return to the pavilion is a micro-choice that costs sleep and ego. Closure beats echo this: she keeps adding strangers to the wall, renouncing solitude, paying with perpetual return. Only flaw: the grandmother’s insomnia is told post-fact, so the bidirectional hereditary drive is slightly inferred rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Celeste’s interior contradiction—archive discipline vs. retrocognitive compulsion—drives every beat; the diary visions physically buckle her knees and dictate the trek. Each micro-choice (climbing the cargo hatch, kneeling at the lagoon, pressing record) visibly pays for truth with bodily risk and career suicide. The ending’s “fierce, bittersweet knowledge” crystallizes a costly renunciation of institutional safety earned by every prior vision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s exile-from-the-Academy motive is cleanly seeded; her seventeen-year solitude is implied rather than shown, but the bottle-warmth micro-choice and the dawn lantern-crafting decision embody her “transformation not preservation” creed with visible cost—she seals her own exile by giving the memories away. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak; the lone flaw is that no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—she never seriously considers keeping the bottle, so the arc is smooth but not jagged. Still, the renunciation is earned and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid—her bodily shock when the apples fall in a 12-3-1 code makes her vocation feel lived-in. The contradiction between archivist neutrality and prophetic utterance is dramatized, not declared. Flawed passivity is present—she “lets” the shaving speak her—but the final kneeling/tablet moment converts that liability into earned cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets ignored; single-POV micro-choices (selecting the book, speaking in Linear A) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—glove-burn, acorn-cap worry, the hum that guides her fingers—so we feel contradiction (hope vs annihilation) in body, not label. The final stance (“ready to carry centuries”) is earned because every prior beat shows her testing the cost of reopening ice. Yet the text keeps her flaw-free: no mis-timed hum, no tremor that misaligns crystals, so struggle feels curated rather than inevitable. Still, the emotional hierarchy (seeds > self > future) is legible and paid for in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s quiet expertise and the braided-rope motif anchor her arc; the final pull is earned by seventeen years of calibrated terror turned inward. Interiority stays concrete—she traces frayed hemp, records impossible barometrics—but the “humble” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The cost is felt: she trades her former power-to-frighten for a single, gentle resonance that offers presence, not panic. Still, the renunciation could bite deeper if we sensed what personal identity she forfeits beyond the job title.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her aching joints, the ritual ladder climb, the palm on cold rail—but her motives stay static; she begins and ends in the same stance of chosen solitude, so no new contradiction or higher-stakes choice is forced. The “cosmic janitor” persona is vivid, yet the text labels her spiritual growth rather than dramatizing a fresh test of it; the final smile feels like confirmation, not costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s tranquil perceptiveness is dramatized through her calibrated micro-choices—reading the ghost-mother’s finger-spelled child-outline, opening the box only after the nod—so the trait actively enables the central beat. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final renunciation (keeping the box closed “not yet”) carries visible cost in the tightening of her arms against the desert heat. The only slight slack is the off-stage grandmother oath; because the covenant’s weight is felt on-page via the accumulating stones, the motivation still coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete and particular—her borrowed years felt as “sediment layers” on her palm. The contradiction between wanting understanding rather than life is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the fragment, sealing the capsule). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts her remaining years as “essential,” foreclosing any return to ordinary mortality. Minor slip: “texture of time” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak once, but is immediately embodied again.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrical and embodied—her grandmother’s “woven dawns” memory feels lived-in, and her choice to weave the kite with the torn feather is a micro-choice that costs her the purity of her solitude. The boy’s minimal interiority is acceptable for his age, but his sudden dignity-switch reads slightly performative. Overall, the flaws are cosmetic; the earned asymmetry of the final image satisfies the closure cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interiority is consistently concrete—her trembling hands, the diary pressed to her chest—showing embodied contradiction between brazen calm and mortal fear. Micro-choices (climbing the oak, teaching the islanders) visibly cost her dwindling stamina, earning the final renunciation. The “brazen calm” trait risks diagnostic label-speak, but it is repeatedly dramatized through physical risk and social transmission, so the flaw hovers below deduction territory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s skeptical lens stays vivid—her boots “leaving dusty footprints” while she clocks her own need for meaning—but the interior shift from debunker to believer is confessed rather than embodied; the tearful pilgrim beside her does more emotional work than she does in the final beat. Still, her chemistry-to-anthropology intellect gives sharp, idiosyncratic notice of the amber and the cost of renouncing her former papers feels real.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Erasmus’s grief-riven solitude and linguist’s calling are vivid, but interiority verges on lyrical self-label (“languages of the dead”). Micro-choices (crushing pods, answering heron) are present yet low-cost; no contradictory impulse in scene to sharpen flaw or trade-off. Endurance is earned, but the cost feels contemplative rather than charged. Still, a singular, memorable consciousness drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marta’s shift from corpse-tracker to mother-on-the-trail is embodied in every creaking joint and scent-memory; the contradictory tug between resignation and hope is lived, not labeled. The autumn-leaf memory is dramatized through the dig, making the past tense of motherhood crack open into present-tense action. Only knock: Sera remains off-page cipher—no micro-choices from her to complicate Marta’s idealized read. Closure choice (walk east) carries full earned cost: she abandons the only safe settlement she knows.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her temporal-patient fingers, the way she counts heartbeats in slow motion—yet her contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in a single beat. The final stance (keep sketching, greet the ship on her own terms) is credible, but the cost is more declared (“solitude had never been punishment”) than dramatized in the moment. Still, the immunity mutation, the family custom, and her quiet refusal to flee cohere into a believable, flawed endurance. A hairline slip from exemplary: we feel her choice, but we don’t quite feel the full ache of the path foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Corwin’s contradictory impulses—thief vs. keeper, guilt vs. need—surface in scene through the trembling hand on the sundial lid and the weep-laugh at the letter. The “chivalrous thief” trait, however, is asserted rather than embodied; we never watch him weigh a specific theft under these ethics, so the flaw stays abstract. Interiority is concrete (“thumb across the ornate lid”) but drifts into label-speak (“wonder demanded both”) in the final beat, blunting cost. The heir revelation lands with visible price—tears and new duties—yet his prior choice to use the lid feels inevitable, not a hard renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s survivor-guilt and need to “write” the dead into marble is palpable; the contradiction between monetizing trauma and honoring it drives every beat. The carving/setting-down of named pawns externalizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is specific—footsteps as alphabet, camp-muscle memory, refusal to speak aloud—never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling. Micro-choice in the final paragraph (she places her own name last) earns the renunciation of crisis-actor life without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—clinging to forgetting while clawing back fluency—are dramatized in every tactile beat; the mercury skin that “retains nothing” yet accepts etched symbols embodies the split. The final ascent is earned: she pays with the literal pain of recovered grief, proving she is “whole enough to hurt.” No label-speak; all interiority is embodied in feather-on-glass sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s guilt-riven exile and need for self-absolution are concrete and embodied; the knight-chess-piece fidget anchors every beat. Interior contradiction—pride in his craft versus horror at its outcome—stays active in scene. The final letting-go is credibly prepared: the mirrored labyrinth literally reflects his culpability, so the drop of the knight into it externalizes the knot he releases. Micro-choices—thread-counting, eye-tracing the maze—show productive restlessness without therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sera’s contradictory impulses—obedient daughter vs. memory-guardian—are dramatized in the final cascade of seven truths; the paint-stained fingers and canyon-echo tests show embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“thought of her mother’s hands…”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to speak many truths is earned by childhood mischief and clandestine rehearsals; the price (ritual failure, Elders’ wrath) is legible. Cap at 8.7 because the external consequence is implied, not yet paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—yearning for absolution while courting oblivion—are dramatized in every beat: clutching the railing yet leaning toward the acid, narrating scars while reopening them. The embodied emotion is specific (brass warmth on her palm, breath held underwater) and escalates to the shattering of the charm that externalizes her renunciation. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, “uncertainty was the crack where the gold got in” is earned through the prior causal chain. The final stance (writing the journal) is a credible, costly endurance that forecloses the option of suicide/dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Edwin’s contradictory impulses—grief-anchored stasis vs. the sudden urge to drive—are shown in concrete micro-choices (packing the shell, taking the unknown path). His interiority stays embodied (“warm enough to hurt”) and avoids label-speak. The final endurance (painting on, accepting fragmentation) is causally linked to the mirror crack and cave epiphany; cost is felt in the shell’s faded sunset entering the canvas. Flaw: the daughter is off-page, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply, capping high-band entry at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s quiet competence and grief-tempered tenderness feel lived-in; her micro-choice to palm the cork and then extend her hand crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The boy’s flickering ghost-body and ocean-heavy eyes individuate him without exposition. No interior contradiction is dramatized in-scene, so the arc leans on earned stasis rather than a turn; that caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a ruined station while rebuilding a beacon for ghosts—are embodied in blistered hands and the ache of sleeplessness. Her micro-choices (soldering mirrors, answering the phone, placing the censer) constantly re-rank her values: memory > survival, duty > escape. The final recognition of her own older voice lands as earned cost: she has sentenced herself to perpetual guardianship, a solitude foreclosed on-page. Interiority stays concrete, salty, and character-specific; no diagnostic shorthand intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—scientific rationality vs. the need to feel safe—drives every beat; the cold calibration of “seven Perigord blacks, gone” instantly embodies her detachment. Her micro-choice to test the eye (“I am happy”) is a tiny, perfect pivot that costs her tears and rewrites her hierarchy of values. The only flaw: the sister-trauma is referenced, not dramatized, so the deepest wound feels second-hand rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—lonely archivist of other people’s dreams who now must finish a stranger’s farewell—drives every beat; the micro-choice to pencil the witness-line under the Edelweiss is the earned cost that forecloses his own eremitic neutrality. Borrowed-memory gift versus solitary identity is dramatized, not labeled. Flaw (eccentricity) complicates rather than decorates: the same habit that lets him receive memories makes him the perfect final recipient. No safety-hedging; the refusal to announce the mountain woman’s fate keeps moral ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s loneliness is shown through thirty years of forsaken relationships and the empty shop pressing “like water,” but interiority wavers into diagnostic shorthand—“she understood then that…” just before the climax. The final choice is credible and costly: she forfeits the life she knows for knowledge rather than fantasy, yet the father’s reappearance feels slightly too-easy wish-fulfilment rather than earned contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    The queen’s buried memory of her advisor poisoning the king is convincingly externalized through the climb and oracle confrontation; her insistence on “words I can trust” shows a ruler fighting symbolism with pragmatism, a sharp contradiction that stays in-scene. Interiority is concrete (“the crown she had left at the palace pressing down regardless”) and her final, deliberate movements manifest earned resolve. Cost is visible: seven years of self-denial plus the upcoming palace purge. Voice distinction is unnecessary (single POV), yet status dynamic with the oracle is cleanly limned through deference and command.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. aching need to hold presence—are embodied in the trembling pocket-sun flare; the final renunciation of “capture” for “participation” is earned by the shell-to-handoff causality and costs her the safety of certainty. Theo functions as a crucible, forcing the micro-choice to surrender the shell; his seven-year witness gives the parting weight. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “scientifically romantic” is shown via calibrated starlight and logarithmic spirals rather than asserted. Only minor cap: the mother grief beat is late and summary, muting the deepest flaw driver.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—desire to map dreams vs. ache of being mapped by them—stays embodied: fingers on bark, ribs twisting under jealousy. Micro-choices (rolling another scroll, deciding to climb) foreclose escape routes with visible fatigue. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped; single-POV voice coherent and particular. Final “smile tasting wonder beneath jade exhaustion” crystallizes endurance at cost, satisfying 9+ quick test for earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s anosmia, tactile obsession with brass, and pivot from scent-healer to clock-mender give her a sharp, embodied interiority that drives every beat; the micro-choice to clean the clamp with water-clock tools crystallizes her new value hierarchy. Margaret’s storm-eyed reticence and white-knuckled grip externalize grief without diagnostic labels, forcing Elena to read shoulders, not odors. The screw’s restoration is a believable renunciation of Elena’s past identity and a gift of continuance to Margaret—cost is the lingering absence of smell Elena will never regain. Status shift is legible: Elena moves from service-provider to witness, Margaret from supplicant to storyteller, both altered.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s fear-to-ice reflex is vividly embodied and contradictory impulses (serve the tea vs. flee) collide in scene. Interiority stays concrete—flashback to cellar crow-count anchors present micro-choice to inhale instead of panic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: ritual precision > safety > self-exposure. Final stance crystallizes when she traces the rune on her own transforming skin—cost is the scar now iridescent, path foreclosed: she can no longer hide the mark or the ice. Missing the 9-band because the mentor’s absence is off-page; no second character to pressure/status-test her, so relationship crucible and status shift are N/A—cap not violated, yet the solo ritual keeps the arc inward and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s guilt and need to atone are viscerally embodied (kneeling, sealing the bottle); his metaphor habit is shown, not told, and collides with the raw apology. The ghost’s shift from tormented to luminous is legible in her final gesture. One flaw: the “gossip-column exorcist” tag is asserted but never dramatized—no press flashbulbs, no snide asides—so the outer persona feels ornamental rather than a lived contradiction inside this scene. Still, the interior hierarchy (guilt > reputation) is clear and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lyric and textured—her perception of “stone that had forgotten erosion” is vivid and particular—but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the witness moves through awe without inner friction or micro-choice that costs her anything until the blank dictionary moment, which is too late to compound stakes. Motivation stays abstract (“to unravel cosmic illusions”) and never narrows to a tangible forfeit or visible flaw. Emotional progression is steady wonder rather than escalating risk; she never doubts, missteps, or pays a felt price, so the renunciation/embrace at the end reads as graceful inevitability, not earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Einar’s reserved obsession with “what clocks really measure” is shown through tactile caretaking of hydraulic clocks and the slow accretion of doubt across seventeen winters; the final choice to count backwards and step through the razor edge is credibly seeded. Interior contradiction is present but understated—his early dismissal of Magnusson’s journal vs. the nightly vigil he keeps—yet the emotional cost arrives only in the last two beats, so the arc feels more conceptual than visceral. Occupation detail is vivid (copper tubes humming off-scale notes) and constrains the climax: only a hydraulic clock shepherd would notice the micro-drip reversals that cue the portal. No second character on stage, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; the solo arc is coherent but slightly under-charged until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s grief and spatial gift are cleanly embodied: she kneels, palms mushrooms, weeps. The “permeable barriers” epiphany is earned by repeated sensory contact with the glowing membranes and her brother’s notebooks; the final stance—holding presence and absence together—costs her tears and tomorrow’s new duties. Interior contradiction is light but present: she arrives to “let something out” yet ends by letting everything in. Competence (intrusion detection) is repurposed rather than struggled against, so the +9 gate is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Margot’s contradictory inheritance—mathematical rigor and ruinous gambling—animates every beat: her decision to ride the Green Line, to photograph seats, to pay the debt while continuing the research. The interiority is concrete (“She would pay his debts—this she had already decided”) and the final renunciation of neat resolution is earned by the accumulated images of cracked mica, clover scent, and annotated margins. The only slip is a trace of explanatory hindsight in “lucid contradiction at the heart of it all became clear now,” slightly dampening the embodied cost. Still, her flawed, pattern-seeking mind is individuated and persists to the last image of the steady candle behind wounded glass.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interior motive—redirecting grief-stricken strangers by inhabiting their mis-dials—is specific, consistent, and crystallized in the micro-choice to invite the mother’s astronomy memory. Embodied emotion (“rainbow fragments across the concrete walls”) and repeated glass-disc handling show contradiction (solitude vs. connection) without diagnostic self-talk. The final gesture of settling in for the next call demonstrates earned stasis at visible cost: perpetual outsider status. Voice stays idiosyncratic; no head-count or relationship choreography issues.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marguerite’s quiet vocation is vividly particularized—“gently thorough” is shown through decades of cataloguing grocery lists, not asserted. The moment she presses the locket to her lips and relinquishes it is a concrete micro-choice that carries ancestral weight and visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—she feels brass warm, tastes salt, never names her feelings. Flaw: final beat leans on the abstract phrase “weight of small moments” instead of a final bodily act, blunting the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s “vanishing before gratitude can pin her down” immediately anchors her flaw; the moon-rock hand-off and the fox chat dramatize jocular loneliness under pressure. The final beat—offering to stay—trades her trademark elusiveness for visible cost, earned by the string of favors she once only facilitated. Interiority stays concrete (“the words unfamiliar and terrifying”) rather than diagnostic. Minor slip: Okonkwo’s neurologist résumé is told, not shown, diluting secondary-character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Meridia’s interiority is tactile and specific—decoding grief through bark grain, choosing the “quiet blaze” over neutrality—so the final stance feels earned. The only drag is the late-cue “dying woman” commission; stakes crystallize after the midpoint rather than driving every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s interiority is laser-etched: the contradiction between her punitive exile and her residual scientific pride is enacted in every micro-choice (grabbing the dry pen to scribble equations on her palm). The causal chain from guilt → anomaly → rewrite is tight; her renunciation of self-punishment in favor of repair lands with felt cost (“she would never be entirely certain”). The only hairline slip is a single diagnostic tag—“confidently uncertain” used twice flatly—else the character would breach 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s contradictory hunger for invisibility yet ache to be witnessed drives every beat; her camera-no-film quirk and embodied “vibrations through floorboards” memory give interiority that is concrete, not therapeutic. Elena’s quiet-charisma label is shown through political muscle—she learned sign to “understand what my politicians wouldn’t say aloud”—and the moment she risks that muscle by carrying silence into chambers. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when Mira trades her nightly solitude to teach mapping silence, forfeiting ghost-status for the harbor’s sake. Cost is felt: Mira will remain unheard while Elena’s new fluency may still fail—an Earned Stasis that forecloses mutual recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miriam’s contradictory drives—guilt vs. ancestral summons—are embodied in the controlled burn and the tremor as she touches her own ancient face. The micro-choice to torch the library rather than surrender the journals crystallizes her hierarchy of loyalties with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific (“archaeologist of the desperate”). Closure is earned: she accepts irrevocable exile above-ground to keep the promise, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her “small defiances” and the ache of housing another mind are rendered through embodied beats (climbing, drumming, tears). The final relinquishment of Elias is earned: her choice to keep returning to the garden after curfew makes her stance legible. The quiet cost—loneliness redefined as cleared space—lands as credible renunciation. No diagnostic self-labeling; emotions stay sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Celia’s tacit knowledge of the maze and her auditory radar are vivid, but her interiority stays utilitarian—no contradictory impulse or visible cost surfaces until she volunteers to guide. The man’s filial motive is sketched only in summary, so the relationship crucible never ignites. Closure is a soft nod, not a stance crystallized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The guardian’s muteness and vigil read as a single, credible stance; the mirrored micro-choices (angling shutters, beaming the dental mirror at the boy’s heart) externalize her contradictory impulses—rescue without speech—earning her final Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and biased: “darkness is not absence but canvas” is filtered through her dentist-trained eye for angles and light. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; her interior conflict carries the arc. The only minus: we never see her competence falter or genuine mistake compound, so struggle edges toward stoic perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—complicity with the system she undermines—stays abstract; the “weight of words” never manifests as an embodied flash or micro-choice under pressure. The cradled queen is the only tactile beat that links past grief to present risk, but it is solitary; we need one earlier moment where her body rebels against its own complicity. Because the renunciation (leaving the board behind) is not preceded by a visible cost on the page, the closure feels lightly earned rather than paid for in sweat or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied (“pressure embraced her transformed body like a welcome”) and her contradictory impulses—yearning for the deep versus residual loyalty to Jonas—are staged in a single, compressed beat. The renunciation of land life is earned through the scrimshaw’s causal trigger and the whale’s call, so the cost is legible. Status crucible with Jonas is brief but charged: his “combative tenderness” forces her to articulate the final goodbye. Dock-worker grace is shown, not told, through “fluid, almost choreographed” loading memories, grounding occupational specificity without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her theatrical self-narration externalizes grief while preserving the mandated blank face, a sharp contradiction shown on every beat. The micro-choice to keep carving figures (and the dried flowers) is concrete, repeated, and charged with cost; the 17th figure crystallizes the private ritual’s toll. Moral ambiguity is embodied, not labeled: she knowingly violates the law yet preserves a gentler humanity. Only the final “almost smiled” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, a hairline slip that keeps this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mora’s interiority is concrete, haunted, and specific to her exile; her contradictory need to test the Council’s walls while still privately doubting is dramatized in the moment she presses quartz to wrist. Micro-choice—paraphrasing rather than copying—turns aesthetic instinct into tactical rebellion with visible cost (the atrium’s awakening, the lake crack). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; head-count stays coherent. Earned stasis lands cleanly: she stays, reads, accepts moth-circled exposure—exile’s wound reopened but now chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting “true” sight even if it ruins her art—drives every beat; the plant-speech gimmick and “innocently cunning” label remain abstract, never crystallizing into a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. Her final laugh is earned, but the emotional climax is slightly over-articulated (“That was the beauty she’d always sought”) rather than embodied. Secondary pressure from Theo is present but static; he functions as cipher more than crucible. Still, the single, visible forfeiture of the reed tongue and the color-awakening keep the arc coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s synesthetic bell-harmonics gift is vivid and embodied (“each strike fractured into harmonics that painted the air with color only she could perceive”), and her cathedral-rope micro-choices show a consistent hunger for connection. Interiority stays concrete until the final paragraph, where “willingness to send signals into darkness” drifts toward thesis-speak without new contradiction: a 0.3 slip. The earned realization at the empty recording—silence is full when attended to—caps her arc with visible cost (tears, exhaustion, return to tower), satisfying the 9- gate for renunciation. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; headcount is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from frozen grief to deliberate mentorship feels lived-in: the calloused fingers, the cot under the cracked dome, the moment she “whispers to her students” while holding a locket of hair and seed all embody contradictory impulses (clinging/releasing) in scene. The interiority avoids therapy-speak, using tactile memory instead of labels. Micro-choices—folding the first clumsy crane, handing the second to a stranger—earn her eventual return to craft. The final stance (carrying grief into making) is renunciation-with-cost, though the off-page “rock-bottom” eviction is summarized, not dramatized, keeping it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s contradictory drives—clinical data-gathering vs. an inherited, almost spiritual curiosity—are held in tension throughout; her micro-choices (measuring the spread, withholding prophecy, confessing the project) all pivot on that fault-line. Marcus’s physical tells (tremor, coat drip, unbidden draw of the Moon) externalize interior collapse without diagnostic labels. Their status flip—powerful client reduced to specimen, charlatan elevated to cartographer—charges every beat. The ending renunciation of control lands with visible cost: she clocks the Moon card, writes the number, tacitly accepts she is only mapping, not saving.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory hunger for truth vs. power is embodied in the trembling sphere-hold; the grandmother veil anchors every beat. The “steadily unpredictable” trait manifests when she abandons scholarly pattern mid-ritual, a micro-choice that costs her remaining innocence. Closure renunciation is earned: she forfeits safe knowledge to keep pain-joy whole. Minor slip: “steadily unpredictable” is once asserted, not shown in earlier gait or diction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—clinging to a physical stone while curating weightless hope—plays out in embodied beats (kneeling, placing the stone). Her “softly deliberate” stance is shown, not told, through the measured offer to the shadow. The ending’s Earned Stasis—accepting luminous regret as the price of guardianship—carries visible cost. Only minor hedge: the grandmother’s hand-off is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting the motivational lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s quiet, tactile vigilance and embodied grief feel lived-in; her micro-choices (stripping rot, cradling the vial) externalize the betrayal without therapeutic self-diagnosis. The interior contradiction—needing to believe some rescues were real—stays active in scene, powering the midnight overhaul. The arc lands as earned stasis: she forecloses the old mission, accepts complicity, and chooses a costed next step (dawn whistle-blowing). Voice stays individual, never drifts into type.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—desire for normalcy vs. need to hear plants—are dramatized in her first micro-choice to flee surgery; her refusal to surrender the telepathy shows visible cost when Thomas’s grief face appears. Interiority stays embodied (palms on frost, coffee-ring fortune) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final “sand began to fall” crystallizes earned stasis: she locks herself into a path that forfeits medical safety yet accepts the miracle’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s craving to “find where unused love is stored” is concrete and felt; her tactile handling of the projector and the film strip dramatizes a contradictory impulse to keep and to release. The psychic triangulation—curiosity, duty to grandmother, half-acknowledged fear of erasure—peaks in the unpowered threading of the Simplex, a micro-choice that costs her the possibility of literal retrieval. Interiority is embodied (“pressure building behind her temples like hushed thunder”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation is earned and scaled to length, but the strip’s earlier beats lean on summary rather than scene, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s gift is vividly embodied (“heard her mother’s buried grief…”) and her renunciation of solitude is earned by the cascade she triggers. Interiority stays concrete, but the final beat of “peace” is stated rather than shown in body or choice, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—"ache with something adjacent to memory"—and her stoic endurance feels lived-in, but the arrival of the child flips her from lone guardian to soft rescuer without visible internal friction. The grandmother’s lullaby-echoed equations are a strong inherited motive, yet the choice to fold spacetime for the girl reads more saintly than costly. We never see her relinquish a concrete want, so the "unlit corner" creed stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—philosopher vs. forest-healer—is dramatized in the moment she palms the worn gear; the embodied tremor in her joints links displacement to vocation. Her micro-choice to surrender the talisman carries visible cost (no backup gear, no safety suppressants) and crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The flaw: her “wild frontier” motive is stated once in abstract shorthand; we get no second beat that tests or complicates it under rising pressure. Still, the gear-in-tree beat earns a credible endurance/renunciation close to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied—“small fears and swallowed words,” “every word she’d never spoken”—and her gathering of deferred flames at climax is a concrete, earned micro-choice that costs her the safety of regret. The ferry guides function more as choral atmosphere than relationship crucible, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are N/A; their lullaby cadence still modulates her stance. No competence inflation or safety-hedging; she remains credibly flawed. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“I was a coward”) instantly softened by the guide’s counter, so no deduction touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s synesthetic agony is embodied and specific; her decision to turn the bolt crystallizes a hierarchy of values (song > survival) that feels earned because every earlier image—grandmother’s piano, the bellhop’s dust-letters—has charged the instrument with ancestral voice. The bellhop’s “seraphically mundane” face complicates his status as silent conspirator without slipping into label-speak; his fingertip writing distills an entire resistance into one on-page micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s contradictory stature-vs-role is vivid, but interiority stays at a regal remove; the “grace that made the air seem clumsy” is the only embodied beat. She never doubts, fears, or weighs cost—her choices are foregone conclusions—so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—grief-driven witness vs. complicit legacy—ramifies in every micro-choice (tapping, atlas touch, transmission). The cost is embodied: eleven years of misdirected guilt crystallize into the night-long act of exposure she can’t undo. The grandmother’s silence is a credible, inherited flaw that compounds the mistake; the ending neither forgives nor absolves, leaving Marina moored to irreversible disclosure. No stock therapy-speak; the rhythmic tapping stays idiosyncratic and stakes-scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s barefoot choice and opera-glass ritual are concrete, character-specific beats that externalize her need to “listen” rather than fight; the internal contradiction between exhausted grief and stubborn hope is kept live in scene, not summarized. The final resolve to carry the “gift of perspective” to the camps is earned by the stone-circle vision, so her renunciation of despair carries visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are rightly absent; grandmother backstory is brief, cued by the glasses, and tilts her present stance. Micro-choices (pressing bare feet to grating, lifting glasses toward comrades’ fires) reveal value hierarchy without label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—telepathic caretaker vs. insurgent resistor—collide in every beat; her cracked voice singing the seed free is the earned, irreversible cost that forecloses retreat and fuses memory to future.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—Mariam’s “hands learning the quiet talent of coaxing life from salt-blasted soil” shows trait-through-action. The contradiction between freeze response and deliberate caretaking is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choices (hand on earth, counting somatic markers) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation—tending orchids tomorrow even if the sky “might hold anything”—earns its cost via prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s contradictory impulses—fleeing versus embracing fragmentation—are dramatized in her tactile handling of the tarot-mirror debris; the moment she layers transparency over opacity crystallizes her prior flaws and costs her the old commercial identity. Interiority stays concrete: “her mirrors had become enemies” fuses psyche and craft. The final stance (painting multiplicity) is earned by the sequence of micro-choices with the silk thread and the collage act; cost is felt in the lighthouse’s amber grief and her shaking hands. No diagnostic self-labeling; voice remains idiosyncratic and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Seren’s obsession with the stretched-time ink is anchored in the visceral loss of her brother; every beat of the hunt is filtered through that wound. Interiority stays concrete—her “seething, glacier-calm rage” is embodied in how she kneels, packs, walks—never abstracted into therapy-speak. The micro-choice to let the ink vanish rather than seize a sample crystallizes her hierarchy: knowledge over rescue, vengeance over safety. Cost is legible: by walking away she recommits to an endless hunt, accepting perpetual isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete (“her hands trembling,” “chest ache”) and her contradictory stakes—mother in 1,203 vs. the discarded dead—are shown through micro-choice: six months clandestine repair, the single keystroke upload. The final line “She felt awake” is an earned epiphany, but the renunciation cost is stated more than embodied; we don’t see her brace for reprisal in body or plan, only assertion. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible and character-specific. Vance functions as secondary pressure, status shift cleanly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s pacifist inversion of her father’s legacy is vivid: she presses thorns soft, pockets the ballast, and refuses the knife. The internal contradiction—hunter training vs. plant-gentling—plays live in scene, not summary. Cost is paid: she kneels on the buried bounty badge, literally and symbolically. Only the soldier’s beat feels observed, not altered, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s stoic fisher temperament is vividly embodied—her stillness under the fountain’s resonance, the micro-choice to “release nothing.” The rail-spike heartbeat spirals give concrete interiority, and her silent offering shows contradictory impulses (grief vs. composure) active in-scene. Cost is legible: the echo she gains forecloses the splinter of not-knowing, re-weighting her future nets. Interiority never slips into label-speak; every beat is filtered through a fisher’s patience.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margaret’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs inherited protectiveness—are alive in the scene: she handles the burgundy-stained nib, traces the math, then chooses partial disclosure. The micro-choice to write “something in between” crystallises her father’s orbit of regret as her own, with visible cost: complicity in silence. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the laugh that carries “solemn playfulness” is embodied, not declared. Flaws (paralysis, sudden empathy for paternal paternalism) complicate the final beat and feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—preserving every lost sound yet unable to heal her own bloodline—drives every beat; the micro-choice to map the letters onto the chamber (not stars) crystallizes the hierarchy of values and triggers the earned release that ends the story. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off stage, but the multi-generational conflict is still rendered as crucible. One minor slip: “she had been searching for a way to send messages backward” is summary rather than embodied moment; still, the final heartbeat-sync is a felt cost that satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her lilac unease, chalk-stained fingers, and sensory read of the mandala keep her particular. Contradictory impulses surface when she both defies the old man and invites him to witness. The final renunciation—art will fade but listening persists—carries conceptual cost, yet the old man’s arc is thinner; his fear dissolves too readily for a stranger under world-ending pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“tears freezing on her cheeks in the warm coldness”), micro-choices (kneeling, chiselling) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost. The retrocognitive curse is more reported than dramatized in-scene, a minor flat spot, but the steel arms juxtapose tenderness and violence convincingly. Earned Stasis lands with felt price: she walks away leaving the name—and her own safety—behind. Motives remain consistent and deepen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Madeline’s contradictory impulses—her craving for applause versus her acceptance of eternal service—surface only in summary; the orchard echoes do the acting for her. The woman’s indigo despair is vividly embodied, but her final shift is reported, not dramatized through micro-choice. Because the ghost’s own renunciation (“this… was close enough”) is implied rather than shown with cost, the arc approaches but does not fully clear the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s skeptical yet affectionate nature is dramatized through her tactile ritual with the lucky coin and her refusal to accept the drug’s effects at face value; every bodily tremor she deciphers is a micro-choice that advances her goal. The fractally precise trait is not merely labeled—it visibly shapes how she handles the muscovite slivers and traces light spirals, turning a concept into gesture. The final smile is earned because her body has already paid the cost of parsing grief, joy, and secrecy in muscle and bone. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only sensory shorthand that makes the telepathy feel lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vera’s motive—map the unknown while humans sleep—drives every move; her tactile readings of rock and fossil translate into concrete micro-choices. The interior contradiction between solitary purpose and emerging inter-species duty is embodied, not declared. Final kneeling/offering beat crystallizes a value shift with visible cost: she commits to speak for the unheard, foreclosing pure solitude. Missing full 9: no secondary pressure from on-page character or status swing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe’s interiority is evocative but drifts toward dramatized self-exposition (“She understood”). Buttons-as-memory is clever, yet the leap from “catalog lost buttons” to “cosmic instruction manual” is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her doubt or mis-sort. The inherited gift for “holding onto what mattered” is tell-stated moments before closure, softening the cost. Still, her quiet climb outward carries credible weight—an Earned Stasis that fits the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.7)
    Margaret’s interiority is sharp—burned hands tracing the pillbox, the cheek scar pulling in cold—but the decisive turn (accepting Viktor’s file) is under-motivated: eleven years of exile distilled into one calm touch on his shoulder. The pillbox and scar anchor her, yet the Choice beat lacks a visible cost on the page; she neither hesitates nor sacrifices anything we feel. Competence is high, struggle muted; the emotional arithmetic is almost too clean for a woman who once crawled from a crematorium.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman’s tactile superstition (needle in pocket, mother’s shroud-sewing backstory) gives him a believable interior life; the silent hand-off to the girl is a credible renunciation that costs him his talisman and lifelong ritual. Interiority is concrete—he “feels the gutters stop ticking” rather than labels emotion. The girl’s hollow eyes and ink-stained fingers are efficient embodiment; her decision to cross is the only consequential choice she makes, but it feels proportionate to her age and exhaustion. No relationship crucible (single passenger), so bullets not invoked; still, the dyad’s tacit pact lands.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Serin’s interior contradiction—stillness sought, movement embraced—is dramatized in her tactile wedging of clay while the disc’s vibration rattles her teeth; the final decision to stay is earned by the felt cost of leaving her grandmother’s memory behind. Micro-choices (bare feet pressing ghost-bee routes, lifting the lantern glass) keep motive embodied. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the epiphany (“Stability was not the absence of movement…”) which momentarily shifts into diagnostic-speak, trimming the top tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—tending life while steeling herself for loss—are dramatized in her kneel-and-wave, not told. The brass-tooth beam is a micro-choice that visibly costs her poise; the returned wave crystallizes a new, fragile relationship. Grandfather’s maxim is cleanly motivated by prior griefs, and the rose-prune promise shows endurance with cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is textured (“calcified around her heart like salt crusts”) and the final renunciation—choosing cultivation over preservation—carries visible cost in the tears she “had forgotten how to cry.” Micro-choices (descending, placing the dial, watching the hatchlings) track her pivot cleanly. The seven-century backstory is efficiently anchored to present stimuli, but the leap from solitary grief to instant nurturer feels lightly telescoped; a single intermediate beat of hesitation or self-recoil would sharpen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradiction between her mechanical competence and her felt emptiness is shown through the micro-choice of writing her own letter and releasing it. The twig spiral anchors her vocation via childhood memory and constrains her present moment—an earned, visible cost. Emotions are embodied (“lighter hands”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation—writing differently tomorrow—lands as credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory drives—scientist’s detachment vs. lone savior—are alive in her micro-choices (welding the door, tuning the dish, scanning fresh charts). Her flaw (obsessive vigilance) both enables the win and costs her any future peace, shown in the ghost-reflection on the scope. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak, and the final beat crystallizes earned isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Helena’s claustrophobia is dramatized through crawling the 3-ft passage—embodied cost visible in “her racing heart” vs “stubborn will.” The micro-choice to crawl is credibly motivated by inherited obsession and the literal lock-fit payoff. Grandmother’s absence keeps relational crucible off-page, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Clara’s face-blindness is never named yet governs every perception; the contradiction between her inability to recognise faces and her forensic gift is dramatised in each micro-choice (counting stones, mapping bone angles). The final sketch is earned: her refusal to see Marcus as monster costs her the comfort of moral clarity, a renunciation visibly paid. Interiority stays concrete—“granite walls rising like tombstones through the morning mist”—never drifts into label-speak. OnePOV, no other on-page characters, so relationship bullets waived; still, the empathic arc is complete and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tremble, the nail warms—but the “idealistic map librarian” tag is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her choose maps or ideology under fire. The ancestral motive is vivid, yet her moment of agency (“She would make them listen”) is summarized, not embodied, so the cost feels announced rather than paid. Still, contradictory impulses (dread vs. hope) coexist in one breath, satisfying the 9+ test for interior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margaret’s contradictory impulses—bridge-song caretaker vs. latent photographer—are dramatized in the glass-flake beat and the final step onto the hidden trail; the cost of abandoning her 40-year identity is felt in the laugh that escapes “like a bridge-song played on an instrument of pure air.” Interiority stays concrete, but a few phrases (“luminous disbelief,” “radical acceptance”) flirt with label-speak, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's "polished calm" as inherited armour is dramatized through micro-choices—pinning money, facing investors—so the trait drives visible action. Interior contradiction is present but stays summarized ("tremor in his bloodline") rather than enacted in-scene; the final rapprochement is credible yet leans on dialogue admission more than embodied cost. Still, the father-son crucible forces a legible status shift and renunciation inside the caboose, satisfying the 600-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s lucid-dreamer vocation grants her a concrete, character-specific way to process grief, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“understanding dawns…”) rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure; the notebook decision lands as aftermath summary, not a micro-choice forged in the dome’s cold. The flaw costs the final beat full earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s guardedness is shown through her satchel ritual and warlike serenity; the three-year backstory is anchored to a present micro-choice (casting the seed). The final unbending is earned—her spine straightens only after she speaks the confession aloud—yet the interiority occasionally drifts toward self-diagnosis (“she understood what mirrors didn’t show”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s scars-as-maps interiority is vivid and specifically embodied; the root-binding curse is shown through her inability to step free even at the climax. Contradictory impulses—yearning to cross the dream-door while physically anchored—are active in the final beat. The moment she recognizes her role as living bridge lands as earned stasis with visible cost: “her roots strained against their earthly anchor.” Secondary characters remain emblematic; only their scars micro-differentiate them, so the relationship crucible is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for certainty yet choosing lifelong doubt—play out in the decisive beat beneath the bone-tree; the cost (forty years of unknowing) is legible and scaled to the story’s length. Interiority stays concrete, anchored to the lantern, the ash, the chest-cavity “wounded bird.” No label-speak; the hole is shown through action and refusal. The final smile in true darkness crystallizes earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing value while doubting his own—are dramatized in the micro-gesture of reciting specs to armor grief; the final micro-choice to follow Val toward the carved names earns the closure by trading appraisal distance for participatory risk, cost visible in the relinquished cloth.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s “kindly methodical” interiority is vivid—she catalogs grief like verb paradigms—yet the caretaker arrives as plot-spokesman rather than pressure-source; the final endurance (“she would stay”) is earned by accumulated image, not by a crucible-choice that costs her a live alternative, so the 9+ quick test narrowly fails.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is atmospheric rather than embodied; “Routine is how we survive” is a thesis, not a revealed contradiction. No micro-choice in the moment of smelting shows her fork between power and fragility. The closing self-question (“Was she the same Mira…?”) is told, not dramatized, so the identity cost is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—archivist of extinction who fears emotional exposure—drives every beat; the shell-writing choice crystallizes her flaw and costs her professional detachment. Pearl callback and phone reply embody embodied emotion. Only minor slip: “afraid too” text feels slightly convenient, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s contradictory drive—hunger for river truth versus guilt over Daniel—propels every micro-choice; the broken accordion pressed to her chest embodies both cost and need. The decision to quit the pills is shown through bodily immediacy (“raw and unfiltered whispers”) rather than diagnosis-speak. Closure is earned: she renounces the demand that the river forgive her, accepting instead the current of self-forgiveness, a path foreclosed with visible loneliness (“she was finally ready to let the current carry her”). Interiority stays particular to her chronicler’s lens, though one stock phrase—“weight of that failure”—dampens full singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrically sustained—gauze, watch, mist all filter perception—but the “I forgive you” beat arrives as abstract summary, not embodied micro-choice under pressure; the emotional cost is declared, not dramatized, flattening the final hierarchy of values. Motive trace is clear (mother’s sealed chain) yet the protagonist’s contradictory impulses (longing / dread) are told rather than enacted in the moment of discovery. Still, the voice stays singular and the flaw is local to the closure beat, so the character reads as a veiled dreamer rather than a theme puppet.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—coffee stains, fern whispers, velvet pulse give Mira a singular sensorium. Contradictory impulses (promise‐keeping vs cultural witness) coexist in the same beats, and her final choice shatters the violin only after we’ve felt the cost in her burning palms and forsworn glow. The mulberry‐ache tonality is character-specific, not decorative. Minor slip: “diagnostic” phrase “empire that had traded its future for frozen music” could be more lived-in, but it doesn’t flatten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s mortician-beautician duality is concrete: she “applied foundation to skin she had kissed as a child,” a single gesture that fuses love, craft, and death. The interior contradiction—comforting the living by dressing the dead—drives her lucid stillness and the climactic decision to trap her mother’s spark. Embodied emotion is precise: the emerald burns then pulses against her sternum, a felt cost that forecloses her prior detachment. Only the mother remains off-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the sole weakness is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “threshold of stillness” phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is rich: her contradictory need to serve the dying while still nursing a mother-wound is dramatized in the tree-climbing ritual and the way she weighs the hairpin’s warmth. Micro-choices—descending “kindly decisive,” placing the pin in Theron’s hand, pressing it to her own sternum—embody the caretaker trait and foreclose the option of remaining aloof. Cost is felt: the pin’s accumulating warmth literalizes the emotional tax of each release. The forgiveness backstory is anchored in present stimuli (clouds, grove, pin) and tilts her caretaker stance; no diagnostic label-speak; no competence without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist’s “sincerely insincere” paradox is lived in every beat—she charges money for clarity yet refuses to deliver certainty, a contradiction that drives her micro-choices (listening under copper chimes, withholding direct advice). Sera’s trembling unwrapping and altered shoulders show embodied change; the keeper’s own protected vulnerability is glimpsed but never therapeutic. Interiority stays particular: “wearing other people’s doubts like borrowed coats” is a keeper-specific metaphor that charges the final image. Closure costs are felt: the keeper hangs the doubt back on its hook, foreclosing personal absorption, a renunciation priced by the wind-chime silence that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s reverse-aging body and Vara’s need to restore her erased village give both characters sharp, contradictory stakes; the withheld lesson turns Elowen into the living cost Vara must later reverse. Interiority stays concrete (“emotions growing rawer as his body reverses”) and the final micro-choice—Vara bowing, accepting responsibility to throw the second stone—pays off the emotional setup. Only the single-scene frame keeps relationship pressure from deepening further.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vessa’s decades-long immobility is credibly anchored in her first, fatal climb; the arrowhead’s warmth and her single smile embody the cost of stasis. The interior contradiction—yearning to guide while refusing motion—drives every micro-choice (humming, reading birds, withholding eye-contact). The new pilgrim’s arrival tests her endurance and forces the inheritance gesture, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Only the traveler’s voice remains generic, blunting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for magic while surrendering the need to possess it—plays out in embodied beats (the mist-walk, the crystal returned to the bag). The final renunciation is earned because the text has shown her tactile disappointment and the automatons’ sterile triumph. Cost is visible: she leaves empty-handed, fingertips glowing with “nothing” that is now something. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s grief-driven search is credibly anchored in the hotel key and Elena’s past; his interiority stays concrete (“the tool he used each night…”). The final renunciation—carrying the secret rather than exposing it—earns its cost via the vial’s vision and the lantern ascent. micro-choices are sparse but purposeful (uncorking vial, standing in dark water). Missing is a second layer of internal contradiction mid-scene to push him past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to coins while preaching dissolution—surfaces only in summary; the final “quiet enthusiasm” is declared, not embodied. No micro-choice shows her paying a tangible cost (a coin falls, is spent, is surrendered). The backwards prophecy is accepted without dramatized struggle, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—duty-bound reaper vs. grieving lover—drives every micro-choice; the crystallizing ritual externalizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The moment she finishes the dead’s sentences, her stoic mask cracks and the glass figurines embody the price. No stock labels; grief is shown via tactile handling of atlas ink and light. Earned renunciation: she descends carrying the named fears instead of erasing them—an irreversible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Corin’s “lukewarm” self-concept is embodied in trembling hands and tepid-robe color; his refusal to quit is shown through spider-silk instruments, not told. Interior contradiction arrives when he admits his devotion is “brittle” yet keeps pouring understanding into cracks. Final bell-whisper earns stasis: he smiles while the viaduct stays indifferent, foreclosing greatness but accepting possibility—cost is the lifetime of mockery he wears. No secondary character on page, so status crucible not tested; micro-choices (measuring fractures, warming bell) reveal value hierarchy clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Martha’s interiority is concrete, her contradictory impulses (needing Dad as martyr vs. hating the abandonment) act in scene, and the final micro-choice—gathering photos to tell the true story—pays a visible cost (her myth dies). The “precisely humane” trait is shown, not labeled: she refuses to shame her mother even when the truth hurts. Flaw complicity is acknowledged; no hedged safety. Dialogue absent, so relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific; the mother-crystal link gives credible sentimental strain. Yet the decisive transformation is delivered via abstract summary (“the touch of wonder moved through her”) rather than embodied micro-choices under threat, muting cost visibility. The “living equation, breathing poem” goal is asserted, not enacted in scene. Still, contradictory impulses (scientist vs. secret dreamer) coexist convincingly until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interiority is granular—fingers moving “through muscle memory,” the buckle’s cold against bone—showing contradictory impulses (duty vs. survival) in real time. The final refusal to fake certainty is earned by her mother’s fatal fall and by the six-hour vigil that follows; the buckle’s transfer from talisman to archived relic shows visible cost. Micro-choices (crossing out conclusions, unclasping the buckle) externalize value hierarchy cleanly. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into diagnostic speak.

    Vera’s interiority is concrete—her laugh “scattered into the storm-born silence,” her palm registers the seed’s weight and smell—but the decisive pivot (building the unsolvable room) is declared rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice on the page. The contradiction between sell-out security and creative integrity is present, yet the moment she plants the seed is more symbolic gesture than costly act; the promised “seven-year patience” remains prospective. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct, the occupation crucible is integral, and the endurance stance forecloses Magnus’s path with a felt if conceptual cost, satisfying the 9− threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Victor’s grief is palpably embodied through the pull-cord handle, and his contradictory need to sing yet fear of sound is kept in tension; the micro-choice to place the handle on the tunnel floor before singing shows motive turned action. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only “stones in chest” and “wound-like smile.” The final climb out carrying “laughter’s possibility” is earned because the tunnel has literally vibrated his silence apart; cost is visible in his cracked voice and the salt of tears on plastic. Cap at 8.7 because the daughter’s voice is only reported, never sampled on-page, blunting full relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—feral self-protective frost vs. the forgotten ache for connection—are shown in embodied micro-choices: stepping out, offering the pendant back, inviting the stranger to stay. The interior contradiction is on-page, not summarized, and the final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost in the “ice in her veins” image. Voice and perception remain consistently hers; no diagnostic jargon intrudes. The only drag is the newcomer, who remains a sympathetic cipher; her tears motivate Maren but we never see her own micro-choices, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s “stoically sensitive” mask is viscerally alive in the freezing eyelashes / volcanic breath paradox and micro-adjustments to the crozier; her seventeen failures are not data but embodied scar tissue. The decision to pour her “remaining life-essence” is foreshadowed by the prior obsession with broken things, so the sacrifice feels inevitable, not convenient. Interior contradiction is constant—hope abandoned yet hope re-forged—keeping her from sliding into alchemist cliché. Only the grandfather’s backstory is told, not dramatized, a 0.2 slip that keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her paradoxical longing to “find the beginning in every ending” is dramatized through the micro-choice of reversing the tower’s circuitry and surrendering to the shard of hush. The Hollywood star fragment warms against her chest, an embodied contradiction of anonymous fame that charges her final weeping beat. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the single-POV arc earns a credible renunciation of voice-for-voicelessness with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s “resiliently positive” stance is shown through breezy dialogue and the decision to up-end the hourglass; the split-self pain at the end gives a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“gripped the rusted railing…smelled of salt and static electricity”). The flickering passengers function as pressure backdrop rather than relationship crucible, so status/secondary-char bullets stay muted, but her own contradictory impulse—laugh while splitting—reads cleanly. One causality bump: the grandmother’s rule-set is delivered in a single inherited line; the leap from “time runs in” to net-repair is asserted, not dramatized, keeping this just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning to reclaim her creation yet fearing its power—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (threading, knotting, gathering). Interiority stays concrete: “the gallery had absorbed her symptoms like moisture into wood.” The final renunciation of certainty for sanity carries visible cost: she stays inside the smaller, thread-bound building, surrendering scale for sovereignty. No stock therapeutic labels; the only slip is a slight over-articulation of “rational enchantment” as concept rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vara’s career-long identity as navigation instructor is credibly upended; her micro-choice to set down the chain link crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays concrete—‘weight…limitation’ felt in palm—without therapy-speak. One flaw: Tessek’s interior is ventriloquised (‘something like sorrow’) which nicks POV purity, but the human core holds.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Vera’s curiosity is repeatedly asserted (“persistently curious by nature”) yet never dramatized in contradiction or costly choice; she listens and translates without visible risk or personal stake. Margaret’s guilt and need are clear, but the sisters’ interior contradictions remain off-stage—Ruth is only a pulse, Margaret only apology. The micro-choice to “translate” carries no escalating cost, so the arc lands as facilitation rather than transformation. The emotional change is Margaret’s; Vera’s curiosity neither complicates nor forecloses her own path.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s fear-of-enclosed-spaces is the motor for every beat: she descends because of it, stays sharp because of it, and the final ascent is legibly harder because terror has taxed her body. The micro-choice to speak the names aloud is the earned, costly turn that forecloses her own emotional escape hatch. One hairline slip: “I see you” drifts toward therapeutic self-labeling, but the embodied cost of the ascent keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The interiority is concrete—heartbeat counting, porcelain shard against skin—and the final release from counting lands as earned renunciation. Yet the “digital ghost” remains more concept than lived contradiction; we’re told it dissolves but never see it complicate her micro-choices in scene. Emotional specificity is strong; causality between archive and self is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the hinge from proof-of-existence to music-of-existence is character-specific and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—gift or curse—drives every micro-choice; her quiet articulation under threat of voice-loss embodies embodied emotion. The decisive turn (pressing the diamond to throat) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: language over safety. Earned stasis lands when she walks deeper into the canyon, copper threads now carrying the full lexicon at visible cost: the diamond has shattered, the birds have settled, her body alone must bear the resurrected tongue. No motivational slippage; every beat tightens the same stake.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—scholarly hunger to vindicate herself vs. the refusal to replicate Samuel’s nihilistic metamorphosis—threads every beat. Her micro-choice to pocket the arrowhead and resolve “to tell his story without bitterness” crystallizes the earned renunciation; the cost is the lifetime of scoffing she now accepts. Embodied emotion is vivid (fingers dark with soil, frostbitten hope blooming in chest). One hairline slip: “she understood then” moment leans slightly diagnostic, but contradiction and cost on the page satisfy the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “weeps when she found it” and later “felt her heart hammering”—and her contradictory impulses (play softly to survive vs. swell the song to become free) act simultaneously in-scene. The micro-choice to shift from whispered dissent to full emotional resonance is earned by her months of covert practice and carries visible cost when the bridge cracks beneath her. The cicada-shell epiphany is dramatized through tactile handling and final dusting, not abstract label-speak. What keeps the score just sub-9 is a trace of safety-hedging: her smile at the end is slightly too tidy, a micro beat of perfect emotional calibration that softens the flaw-cost we’ve watched accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured—his “cosmic ledger” belief and ghost-metaphor self-conception feel specific—but the on-page micro-choice that proves the “respectfully rebellious” trait is only alluded to (bending rules until they “hum”) rather than dramatized. The final smile and walk into the gap register as a credible renunciation, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied. Secondary pressure from the daughter is present, but the relationship crucible is one-directional—she receives, he transmits—so the emotional risk lands lightly on him. Still, the hierarchy of values (promises over safety) is legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—silence as both prison and canvas—drives every micro-choice; the halo fragment warms, the phonograph plays, and he pushes breath through scarred tissue. The final renunciation (stay, repair, sing) is earned by these concrete beats and carries visible cost: he forfeits the highway’s forward motion for the train’s arrested circle. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The only drag: “interpreted silence as possibility” edges toward label-speak, but the body-in-scene quickly re-embodies it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor’s inherited mission and scarf-tugging tic are vivid, but she is the only on-page actor; the “patrons” are static furniture. Interiority is rich yet stays reactive—no hard choice until the final step into hyper-space, so the renunciation is felt yet thinly earned. Micro-choices (walking, touching scarf) repeat rather than escalate, limiting contradiction-in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miriam’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in concrete nightly actions; the micro-choice to climb the fog-roof anyway crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays particular—counting lost details of her mother’s hair, the “luminous absence growing heavier.” The final endurance—accepting a presence-through-absence—is earned by the prior failed experiments and costs her sleep, safety, and the last illusions of retrieval. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; all struggle is retrospective, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—terrified mother vs. inter-dimensional locksmith—are dramatized in her tactile grip on the pouch and the star-guided re-write of cosmic machinery; the renunciation of “simply free the idea” is earned, costs the sky itself, and lands with embodied shivers.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marek’s lifetime of tending, waiting, and finally choosing to exhale wonder into soil is rendered through embodied micro-choices (cupping fruit, exhaling, weeping). The contradiction between resignation and stubborn generativity is active in every beat; final endurance costs him his remaining life span, legible in “he was old now, truly old,” yet the garden’s survival is tied to that cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority stays concrete and orchard-bound. The only limit keeping this from 9.5+ is that external pressure stays abstract—no second character or status clash to sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is embodied and character-specific—her trembling fingers, the way silence “accumulates like dust” inside her. The micro-choice to unravel rather than mend crystallizes her contradiction and drives the plot. The final beat heals her hands through action, not miracle, earning the change. No stock therapy-speak; even the meta-line “I broke things I cannot fix” is grounded in porcelain shards we have seen.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s map-framer eye and methodical curiosity are credibly anchored in micro-actions (comparing footage, touching the tear), but she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything; the final beat is observation plus typing, not renunciation or risk. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“she had learned…”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction under threat. The absence of a second on-page character keeps status pressure off the page, so the crucible is purely cognitive; that limits the depth of flaw-driven mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s grief-hardened composure is rendered in concrete, embodied beats—“her gloved hand trembled,” “breath the only sound”—that show her quietly analytic nature under pressure. The interior contradiction between scholarly detachment and submerged longing is sustained without diagnostic speak, and the final micro-choice to surface with the globe, not abandon it, crystallizes her earned shift from clutching to carrying. The losses are not just listed; they torque her risk calculus, making the acceptance of the captain’s lesson credible. Cost is visible: she will keep the globe’s secret for herself, paying the price of public silence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her “tinkersong wonder” voice, the tactile brass at her throat, the grandmother’s bolt plate as heirloom compass. The contradiction of isolation vs. vocation is embodied: she sings to ghosts because living ears never listened. Her final decision—to keep singing in secret murals—costs her any future audience, a renunciation legible on-page. The only minor gap: we’re told her name is forgotten but never shown how that erasure stings in-scene; the pain is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s warm curiosity is credibly etched through her seven-year habit of asking after widows’ recipes and gardeners’ devotions; the diary discovery turns this trait into a causal engine. Interiority stays concrete—amber lenses warming her chest, palms pricking with cold—rather than diagnostic. The final gesture of lifting the first jar is earned: her prior servant labor and decoded grief literally build the muscle and moral authority to release Vesper’s light. Cost is visible: the diary’s cracked leather and her mother’s death freight the moment so the renunciation of servitude carries tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s grief-rooted vocation and her father’s inherited obsession give her a sharp, idiosyncratic interior lens; every micro-choice (lifting the telescope, christening a cloud) grows from that wound. The final “speak back” moment crystallizes her shift from passive cataloguer to active translator of sky-memory, paying the cost of permanent exile. Interiority stays concrete—frost on glass, telescope weight—avoiding label-speak. One minor slip: the causality between naming clouds and internal change is asserted more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her tactile perception of faces as “landscapes of texture” is specific and embodied. The contradiction between her blindness to faces and her sought-after art is dramatized through her hands-on discovery of the coin’s coordinates, a micro-choice that tilts her stance. Yet the arc is more accumulative than causal: she “understands” rather than decides, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. The Earned Stasis rings true, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s obsessional curiosity is more than backstory: it drives every beat—tracing hopscotch numbers, cross-referencing the cipher, choosing to stay up alone—and the final grin is a credible renunciation of rescue fear. Interiority stays concrete (“hands shaking,” “laughing aloud”) without label-speak. No contradictory impulse is staged in a single scene, so the 9+ quick test barely fails, but the endurance cost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—she registers the lock through her fingertips, hesitates over the vial—but the contradictory impulses promised in the 9+ gate are only asserted (“understanding flooded”) rather than enacted in a beat where fear and desire coexist. The earned cost is present (she gives up the safety of indecision and releases the note), yet the mentor’s driftwood nostalgia is filtered through her summary rather than dramatized choice, so the flaw feels named, not lived. Still, her micro-choice to uncap is a visible pivot that forecloses retreat, satisfying the basic causality test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“strangely trustworthy, this dead man” shows a layered, contradictory stance toward the ghost—but her moment of kneeling to chalk “Thank you. You could join us” is the only micro-choice that alters the relationship. The ghost’s motives remain reported, not dramatized, blunting the crucible effect. Secondary settlers (Marcus, Yuki, Sola) apply pressure via dialogue, yet their arcs are compressed into polite competence. Cost is felt, but the renunciation of solitude is the ghost’s, not Elara’s; her agency plateaus. Overall characterization is strong, but the decisive change is off-stage in the ghost’s silent smile.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s grief-fuelled vocation is credible and particular; the broken puppet head acts as an embodied conduit for her contradictory impulses—love, guilt, transcendence—so her final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“pressed her lips to its cracked crown”) rather than therapeutic. The one hairline slip is the slightly abstract “beautifully flawed existence” tag; otherwise flaws complicate every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s reluctant caretaker guilt, orchard-haunted dreams, and precise cliff-footwork feel lived-in; the single micro-choice—pressing ghost-light marks—crystallizes her values and accepts the cost of eternal return. Interiority stays concrete (“orchard called her back… voices pleading through her sleep”) and her flawed passivity is the very obstacle she surmounts in-scene. The ending’s quiet refusal to abandon the grove lands as earned stasis with visible price. No stock phrasing; every reaction is filtered through orchard-bred perception.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—rational chemist vs. grieving mother—remains vivid and embodied; the chrysalis-handling beats show hierarchy of values (science vs. memory) with visible cost. The final lab renunciation is earned: her pivot from permanent adhesives to dissolvable scaffold grows directly from the river insight and the pocketed chrysalis. Only minor slip: “loosened grief…almost like peace” edges toward therapeutic abstraction in the closure beat, blunting full 9-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—ex-forger hungering for originality while fearing the bracelet’s arithmetic—are alive in every beat; her micro-choice to drip moonlight onto the slate crystallizes the arc. The child’s entrance forces a visible shift from self-protection to nurturance, embodying earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“the word felt like the first sentence of something new”) rather than diagnostic. The bracelet’s pulse and the child’s too-old eyes supply embodied emotion without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“chef’s knife strapped to her thigh like a talisman” instantiates profession + curse in one image. The contagious-touch curse is embodied, not labeled, when she flinches from Cassius then chooses contact at the end. Micro-choice in the pavilion—hand on coral, deliberate second touch to filter what she off-loads—earns the partial release. Cost is felt: she keeps the compassionate residue, trading perpetual tremor for manageable ache; the endurance is credibly scaled to 750-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her catalog of “voices of grain elevators” is a singular obsession that drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between her empathetic impulse and her almost clinical, decisive lab-work is dramatized in the live wire swing and multilingual cueing. Cost is present but diffuse: the risk is implied (public ridicule, personal exhaustion) rather than dramatized in a single, legible forfeiture, so the renunciation feels more conceptual than visceral. Still, the final image of her pressing the weight to her heart crystallizes the hierarchy of values without sentimental exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s helical, "chaotically precise" mind is shown in concrete micro-gestures (angled mirror, exact equipment placement) and contradictory interiority—engineer’s logic colliding with mystical hunger. The memories she absorbs are dramatized, not labeled, and each wave visibly taxes her body (tears, trembling), creating escalating cost. Her final refusal to distinguish “her” longing from the acquired ones is an earned renunciation that forecloses return to ordinary identity. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; perceptual signature stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “prism-minded” gift is shown through her reading of margins and phosphorescent ink, grounding motivation in concrete action. The inversion chamber forces a visible shift from seeker to guardian, crystallized when she leaves her own doodle—an embodied cost. Interiority stays specific (“latent blaze… finally had its fuel”) and avoids label-speak. The arc earns its turn, though the beat of actually deciding to plant the seed is slightly under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to an obsolete craft while adapting to silence—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of outward sound is earned by the tactile trial-and-error that precedes it. Embodied emotion (“hands ached with the silence”) is specific, never diagnostic. The hedgehog’s presence supplies external pressure without diluting focus. Only the grandmother backstory is told, not tested, keeping her just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Helena’s exile-for-teaching-beauty-in-loss is vivid; her tactile worship of the basalt stone embodies contradictions of precision vs. surrender. The journal-writing micro-choice under magnetic hum shows values in action, and her final vow to seek the next exile carries felt cost. What keeps this from 9+ is that the interior contradiction is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in a single, high-pressure beat where we see her nearly recant or pay immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic—her “whispered confessions of broken clocks” and “ultraviolet range of human feeling” reveal a mind tuned to grief and repair. The forgiveness beat is earned because seventeen years of silence are compressed into the tactile ritual of striking forks; her tears at the end embody contradiction (grief transmuting to joy) without therapy-speak. However, the sister remains off-page, so no relationship-as-crucible pressure is possible; the only status shift is internal. Still, the micro-choice to speak aloud into darkness is a visible hinge that forecloses resentment and pays the cost of not-knowing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—smell catalogues, hunger for mastery, dread of crowds—but her decisive moment (refusing to stay) is sketched more as thematic coda than as visible cost; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the renunciation beat. Thessaly functions more as oracle than secondary pressure, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation stays consistent yet plateaus; the scent-gift never complicates or endangers her, softening flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s contradictory motives—inheritance-rescue vs. surrender to the grove—surface in the micro-choice to release her family seed instead of extracting sap; the embodied cost (floating upward, voice-choir invasion) makes the renunciation legible. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak: “tasted of minerals and growing things.” The grandmother artifact + seed placement together foreclose the extraction path with visible price. Minor slip: “intrepid” is told once, not shown, but the beat-to-beat pilot competence/trepidation ratio stays believable.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulse—guilt-driven vigilance versus institutional futility—remains embodied in crouched wind readings and pocket-patch pressure; the final vow to “speak second” crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The only bar: no second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets are moot yet interior contradiction is vivid and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Meren’s synesthetic gift is shown, not labeled, and it drives every action she takes; the 17-year search is compressed but still grounds her monomania. Her moment of realization—that silence was unfinished, not sacred—arrives as embodied awe (frozen tears) and forces a costly choice to break the very hush she revered. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the interior contradiction (destroy what she loves to save wonder) is dramatized in-scene. The only flaw is a touch of explanatory prose about “certifying wonder” that drifts toward thesis rather than lived stake.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s survivor-guilt engine is vivid and embodied; the “failure lived in her bones” line crystallizes her. Interior contradiction flares when she breaks her deathbed promise, yet the moment is rushed—one clause of trembling fingers before the lid lifts. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: knowledge > oath > solitude, but we get only a single beat of visible cost (the long walk down) rather than a durably altered stance. The voice is individual, but the final renunciation (“she would be ready”) is predictive, not yet enacted, so the cost feels prospective, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is rich—ink-stained hands, golden-ratio obsession, the shiver of borrowed grief—but her moment of “transposed empathy” is announced more than dramatized. The drowned-poet personality never speaks or acts; we’re told it “intensifies” rather than seeing a contradictory micro-choice. The earned cost is present (she smiles with “his mouth and her own heart”), yet the causality feels lightly sketched because the turn arrives via typographic epiphany rather than a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s trembling hands and satchel-clutch are vivid, embodied tics that persist until the pendant’s warmth stills them—an earned, visible mark of change. The interior contradiction between duty and devotion is quietly dramatized through her choice to linger at each monastery, not declared. Master Hallen’s absence functions as an off-screen mentor, but the story pivots on Maren’s micro-choices, so the absence still shapes motive without violating single-POV focus. No diagnostic self-labeling; the final “vessel for wonder” line is the closest to abstraction, but it is tied to the physical act of carrying and is justified by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse in the cold, the prism’s weight in her palm—but the “attentive mystic” label is never tested against an external antagonist or a second on-page character, so status/relationship crucibles are absent. The contradiction between scientific rigor and mystical inheritance is cleanly dramatized; the only missing piece is a micro-choice that visibly costs her something right now (the frost is melting, yet she suffers no tangible forfeiture). Earned stasis is present—she renounces publishing proof—but the cost is retrospective rather than dramatized in scene. Voice remains specific and unsentimental throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s transformation into “thread” is foreshadowed by generational craft and the amber bead, so the self-sacrifice feels inevitable, not convenient. Interiority stays concrete—calloused fingers, the bead’s weight—avoiding label-speak. The only friction: we get no contradictory impulse; she moves from resolve to dissolution without hesitation, slightly flattening depth.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Oren’s meek exterior is credibly fused to stubborn endurance: “A meek man learns patience… becomes part of time.” His solitary POV shows embodied emotion (hammer weight, silk hum) and one clear hierarchy of values—orphard over escape—sealed by the choice to climb back up and forge. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; all conflict is stated as summary, so the interior friction never peaks under live pressure. Still, the final renunciation of magic for slow grafting carries a visible, earned cost that scales to the piece’s lyric span.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Competent interiority—Mira’s fingertip mapping and shard warmth anchor her motives. The final stride into the rift feels earned because every beat ties the glass filter to maternal absence. Yet the emotional paradox (stoic scientist-mother yet sentimental keepsake) isn’t embodied in gesture before the flashback; we get summary instead of contradiction under pressure. Still, the micro-choice to chronicle safe routes shows a visible cost in inherited toxicity, meeting the 9+ quick test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—her vow of silence versus the need to speak to the dead keeper—are dramatized in the spiral climb and the moment she breaks the seal; every micro-choice (touching the sea glass, rebuilding the cairn, adding her letter) is tethered to her father-taught code and costs her the last scrap of protective distance. The interiority is concrete—“the particular quality of silence that settles into abandoned places”—and the embodied tremor of decision is legible without label-speak. The final renunciation (voice reclaimed, chain accepted) forecloses her former life as the reticent courier and is earned by the accumulated weight of read strangers’ griefs. The only minor lapse is “she understood then why the chain had been created,” which edges toward interpretive summary rather than lived deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“laughing with the thunder”) and motive endures, but no contradictory impulse ever threatens her stance; the only micro-choice is lighting the wick, a ritual repetition not a fresh risk. Cost is poetic (“aching legs”) rather than dramatized on-page. Character feels singular yet static—sufficient for lyric mode but short of 7+ without a tested flaw or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Senna’s contradictory impulses—grief for her cruelty vs. hunger to inherit Mei-Lin’s gift—co-exist in the same beats, not in alternating summaries. The embodied shiver of the new heart when the light hits her hands makes the interiority visceral. The micro-choice to volunteer her hidden cruelty under the sun-band is a credible, costly renunciation of her old guarded life. Only the “quietly explosive” label is repeated without fresh embodiment, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s grief is embodied in the forty-one units she keeps returning to; the micro-choice to kneel and thank the oak externalizes her shift from custodian to witness. The contradiction between her need to measure sorrow and her new willingness to release it plays out in a single tactile beat. Cost is legible: she accepts that some sorrows stay, and her rounds now serve the trees, not the hedges. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final smile is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“songs remained embedded in her throat like seeds”—and her amnesia/remembering arc drives every beat; the final self-erasure is foreshadowed and costs her everything, satisfying earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam’s grief-driven withdrawal and anonymous phone-counseling are credibly particularized; her body stays slumped, voice low, hands smoothing the same invitation. No stock therapy-speak—she never labels herself “healer,” just answers calls. Contradictory impulse (to vanish yet keep watch) shows in real time: she steps inside the library while rehearsing escape routes. Interiority anchors every beat; final acceptance feels like earned stasis rather than cure. Minor slip: the librarian’s instant diagnosis (“You’re watching”) nudges into thematic echo, trimming full believability.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her noticing compulsion is embodied in the bread-handling and seed-planting beats. The contradiction between rage and tender patience is held in scene, not alternated in summary. Final renunciation (“stopped expecting answers”) is earned by the causal chain of planting against erasure; cost is visible in her solitary continuation. Voice stays particular, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s gently meticulous caretaker persona is vivid and embodied—her steady breath freezing, her measured steps through collapsing aisles. The interior contradiction between custodial duty and the need to choose one vow is dramatized early and sustained. The final act of capturing the child’s vow feels inevitable because her precision has been shown as both strength and limit; the cost is her life’s work evaporating around her. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains specific and un-florid.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—fob crescents in skin, “comforting unease”—and the father-haunted motive stays taut. Yet the final pivot from moonshine heir to “keeper of silence” is asserted rather than dramatized; we see no moment where she actively renounces the runner life. The emotional cost is present but not compounded by an interior contradiction in-scene. Still, the embodied grief and micro-choices under pressure keep her credibly steadfast.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vera’s “luminous skeptic” persona is vividly embodied through her taste-based sensing and the ring’s empty-center orientation; her brother-loss motive remains active and charges the final acceptance. Interior contradiction is alive when she tastes truth yet still questions. The three weather-carriers function as immediate external pressure, forcing her micro-choice to take the charged leaf—visible cost scaled to length. No stock therapy-speak; only the “why some people carry weather” line flirts with abstraction but is saved by sensory follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete—her charcoal-stained fingers, the throat tightening at the canvas—and the contradiction between memorized duty and repressed creation pulses throughout. The final act of drawing is credibly earned by the generational weight she literally touches (the lock, the letter, the half-face). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived; the “ghost” portraits function as pressure, not people. Flaw: the epiphany edges toward tidy articulation (“sorrow and creation were the same breath”), slightly diagnostic in the last paragraph, trimming the apex.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei Lin’s “wilts near dishonesty” trait is not merely stated: it physically compels her six-hour descent and shapes her mother’s evasive strategy, giving the quest visceral stakes. Interiority is concrete—her lungs tighten, her hands shake—rather than abstract. The final inscription (“Where lost conversations wait to be found”) crystallizes an earned renunciation: she accepts partial truth as the price of protecting others from the same pain. Micro-choices (bringing gilding tools, braving tunnels) trace a clear values hierarchy; the emotional cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s seasonally-mute inheritance and synesthetic bell-skill are vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“preserve the color of wonder”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decisive gesture—mounting the ice sculpture and leaving without speech—earns credible renunciation, yet the micro-choice that proves she’s risking failure on the page is missing; the monks’ awe stands in for her cost. Still, the copper-thread heredity, taste-of-bronze gift, and final bone-vibration goodbye make her a singular instrument of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    VERA-7’s nostalgic-android interiority is vivid and specific—the static grown loud, the borrowed fears calcified—yet her final micro-choice (miniaturize & bury) feels slightly under-motivated; we see the emotional build but not the causal leap that makes *this* act the inevitable release. Still, the embodied contradiction (“synthetic fingers brushing petals that felt more alive than her own chassis”) sustains pressure, and the Earned Stasis of turning with the roses carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingers tracing the clasp, her ear tuned to story—and her micro-choice to offer the courtyard as meeting place is earned. The contradiction between her commercial role as “discerning curator” and her quietly restorative mission charges the final image. Mrs. Okonkwo’s grief is likewise lived-in; tremor on the cane line shows cost. No stock labels or therapy-speak; voice stays individual.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s fear-to-armor arc is embodied through the dance-cipher; the final port de bras crystallizes inherited resolve with felt cost. Yet the interior contradiction between terror and precision is told more than dramatized in the underwater beats—no trembling hand slips, no mis-step that might have let seawater erase a page. The dancing decryption is original and specific, but the story keeps her competence too frictionless for full 9-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s ache over her erased mother is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to open the wildflower book against the tide-master’s ban shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction—obedience vs. memory hunger—remains active in the salt chamber. The salt-key moment is a hair under-motivated: no prior cue that the book spine itself is a tool, so the lineage “click” feels lucky, not earned. Still, the final step-through-door carries visible cost: she abandons her dock life and lungs herself into the between-world lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation as a silence-summoner is vivid and embodied; the interior contradiction between urgent world-saving and monastic restraint is palpable in her micro-choices (kneeling, trembling retrieval of the wing). Yet her flaw/struggle remains static—no misbelief or capacity limit is tested or overcome—so the climax feels like confirmation rather than costly renunciation. The solitude is atmospheric, but without on-page opposition the relational crucible and status shifts cannot activate. Still, her embodied attention to water, paper, starlight individuates her and satisfies the 9- gate for interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interior growth from curious neighbor to inheritor of the building’s language is embodied through sensory micro-choices (pressing palm to wall, hearing morning stretches). The protagonist’s contradictory fear of and hunger for the uncanny stays active in scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of asking no questions about Elara’s death. Flaws—naïve trust, voyeuristic hunger—compound and are accepted in the final stasis with visible cost: lifelong custodianship of a haunted garden. Because Elara is already dead, relationship pressure is off-page; what remains is the crucible of successor vs. building, which satisfies the 600-word default.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mirabel’s arc from passive grief to active gift is legible and embodied in the night-long speech to the shell; the interior contradiction (skeptic/hopeful) is present but summarized more than dramatized in-scene, so the micro-choice pressure feels slightly blunted. The renunciation of being remembered is credible, but the cost is stated (“isolation could become independence”) rather than felt in body or action on the page. Elena remains off-stage; relationship-as-crucible is therefore off-page, so the emotional crucible is solo and thus less sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veren’s contradictory drives—guilt-ridden survivor vs. preserver of truth—are dramatized through the micro-choice to bleed into the ink, embodying Aldric’s hand. Interiority is concrete: the calcified guilt, the prince’s whispered words, the key’s warmth before it crumbles. The 40-year weight is shown via ritualized action, not exposition; the final forgiveness is earned because the forged signature literally rewrites history at visible cost. No secondary character on-page, so relationship bullet waived; single-POV interiority remains specific and unflinching.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic hearing of “layered harmonies of intention” is character-specific—but the turn from passive questioning to active sabotage happens in a single line (“she could ensure others learned the truth”) without prior micro-choices that dramatize the shift. The cost (lifelong silence) is declared rather than tasted; we never feel her throat physically lock or see her first halting attempt to speak and stop. Motivation therefore jumps tracks rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s vocation and private ache are vividly particular; her choice to “speak of lighthouse lamps and insurance claims” crystallizes a value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“the cold seep into her,” “psychic residue that clung to warped glass”) and avoids label-speak. One missed beat: no embodied contradiction at the instant she decides to confront the council—only resolve—so the final cost feels announced rather than physically tasted. Still, the renunciation is causally earned and the flaw (compulsive communion with the dead) complicates every step.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mirelle’s interiority is concrete—calloused fingers, seventeen years of watching, the decision to publish nothing—yet her contradictory impulse (share/ conceal) stays summary, not dramatized in-scene. The grandmother memory anchors motive, but the climactic choice to keep whistling merely extends what she already does; cost is felt as elegiac hush rather than a foreclosed path. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific enough to power the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya’s “drive to excavate truth” is stated early and repeatedly, but we see only one embodied micro-choice—unwrapping the diamond. The interior contradiction between skeptic and believer is asserted, never dramatized in-scene; the emotional turn is summarized (“something cold settled in her chest”) rather than lived. Her decision to leave with the diamond feels inevitable, not costly, because the text has not shown her weighing any live alternative. Competent, but the absence of a visible, fork-in-the-road moment keeps her just shy of 8-band interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s interior contradiction—preaching doubt while relishing reverence—peaks when she risks her “Oracle” authority to sabotage Caro’s assault; the embodied cost is her cherished isolation dissolving as campfires climb. Static choir, joke corpse, ghost weather reports give tactile, idiosyncratic worldview; no label-speak. Micro-choice to transmit ancient shadows instead of blessing weaponizes her variant allegiance and forecloses prophet identity. Reflection blocks stay anchored to present static cues and tilt tactics; loneliness reframed as “waiting for them to arrive ready to listen” lands earned stasis with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is textured—“the familiar ache of beauty too large for his chest”—and the final whispered name shows renunciation with cost. Yet Marcus’s contradictions stay mostly retrospective; the present-scene micro-choices (uncorking the jar, shouldering his coat) are thin compared to the reflective blocks, so the shift to action at the end feels slightly under-cooked rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her “logically emotional” filter drives every beat from risk calculus to the fatal resonance. The key pressed to her sternum, her pulse-counting, the step-by-step hum tweak all externalize motive with embodied cost. No secondary character pressure is available, so crucible and status dynamics are N/A. The final dispersal is earned because earlier adaptation obsession is weaponized against her; the causality is clean, the cost absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s grief-scarred patience is credibly embodied in the brass-and-bone ritual and the smile at the ice-groan; the final “learned to give” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the brother’s death is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the contradiction that forged her. Still, every micro-choice on the platform is filtered through that back-story pressure, so motivation tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margaret’s investigative posture is vivid—her palm on the tunnel wall, flashlight arcs—but the interiority slips into canned therapy-speak (“fortified vulnerability,” “associative recall”) right when the lantern’s flood hits. The moment of entangled memory is narrated rather than dramatized, so the contradictory impulse we need for 9-band is reported, not embodied. Still, her cumulative micro-choices (photograph, touch, promise) build to a credible renunciation with cost, satisfying the earned-stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s guilt and need for earned forgiveness drive every beat; the embodied shame in his “weathered hands” and the stones-in-chest metaphor are specific and costly. His micro-choice to bring “something of himself” next week crystallizes the arc. The moment he registers that the melody will carry “the ghost of its silence” is a credible, earned renunciation. Only hairline slip: the interior monologue nears therapeutic self-label once (“I want to deserve his forgiveness”), but the line is immediately complicated by Ruth’s silent reply and the metallic cost of the mainspring image, so the flaw never touches the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zephyr’s “aggressive curiosity” is vivid, embodied, and motive—her micro-choice to bolt the arrow-tip to her prow crystallizes values. Interiority stays concrete (“absolutely hilarious” dissolve-or-transcend). One flaw: the Boiler only externalizes skepticism, never applies live pressure, so the status-dynamic bullet idles. Still, her irreverent courage earns a Charged Poise ending with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motive—curiosity for deleted truth—supplies steady fuel; pockets of reflective summary and label-cram (“obsession,” “digital fossil”) keep her from the highest band. Interiority is solid on bodies and breath, but her one blunt action—grabbing the patch—trails the strongest micro-choice; more dynamic compromise mid-chase would have lifted pressure. Earned Stasis lands with cost (job, safety, sleep) and is credibly fore-shadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—shadows as “loyal hounds” re-casts her burden in the final paragraph—but the moment of self-inclusion is narrated rather than dramatized; we watch her realize instead of feeling the micro-choice that proves the shift. The keeper’s dialogue delivers diagnosis (“You feed them your own compassion”) that borders therapeutic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost. Still, the contradiction between carrier-of-darkness and recipient-of-mercy is legible and tracks to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s loosened grip on reality is embodied in her sensory drift and micro-choice to join the trawl; the parasol tip as tactile relic anchors her endurance. The interior contradiction—coming to die, choosing to drift—remains consistent and charged. Renunciation of the Zurich appointment is implied, cost felt in the final “waiting itself” image. Voice-specific perceptual warp keeps her individual, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s quiet endurance and the micro-gesture of placing the charred fragment on the table embody contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) under pressure; his choice to stay eleven autumns and now to share the relic forecloses future solitude with visible cost, earning the renunciation. Sofia’s “gently persuasive” stance is dramatized through active listening that extracts testimony rather than exposition. Interiority stays concrete: “second heartbeat” for guilt, “copper light” for memory. No label-speak at peak beats; dialogue carries distinct subtext. The relationship never tilts into power imbalance, yet both leave altered—Earned Stasis achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The walker’s “strangely honest” trait is shown only in dialogue tags, never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the mask-as-balance idea is evocative but never complicates her tactics. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory under pressure, so the final consecration feels pre-ordained, not wrested. Still, her peripheral-awareness gift is consistently filtered through bodily attention and anchors motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s perceptively calm interiority stays consistent and informs every micro-choice; the photograph arcs externalize contradiction without therapy-speak. Motivation is rooted in inherited grief-cartography and intensifies as each invitation risks reopening wounds. The final quiet witnessing costs her the comfort of anonymity, earned by the prior cascade of reopened doors. No causal break, no label loops; the only limit is that Maren’s own flaw/loss is implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s reticence and scholarly solitude are credibly embodied; her micro-choice to stay in the dead library is anchored by the crystal’s unpredictable returns, giving her a visible cost (isolation, ridicule risk). Interior contradiction—hope vs. the shame of “needing to prove language is not truly dead”—is present but stays verbalized in summary rather than enacted in a single decisive beat, keeping the change short of full earned stasis. The final whisper “Begin” is a credible endurance that forecloses evacuation, but the emotional price feels lightly skimmed, not corporeally tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s precognitive amnesia is dramatized through embodied ritual—chalk dust on fingers, driftwood arrows—so the flaw actively shapes every beat; the final renunciation (“the forgetting was mercy”) is earned because we have watched him physically exhaust the one tool that channels his curse. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into diagnostic labels. The only bar to 9.0 is that the loss of the chalk feels pre-ordained rather than a choice that costs him an alternative path we can name on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her voice cracks, tears trace “silver paths”—but the moment of change rests on Yua’s lecture rather than a pressured micro-choice of her own. The father remains off-stage, so the emotional engine is second-hand; the final decision to stay is gently foreshadowed but not driven by a visible internal contradiction that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s “decisively kind” trait is dramatized through the micro-choice of singing grocery-list lyrics that calm Samuel; her interior contradiction—professional serenity versus private memory of loss—surfaces in the pocketed shard, giving her credible depth. Samuel’s trembling hands and volunteered terror embody emotion without label-speak, and his shift from shattering to co-creating the kintsugi record shows a believable re-valuation under pressure. The shared hand-clasp at the end costs both characters the illusion of control, sealing an earned, visible change.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s “quietly deliberate” trait is repeatedly asserted and shows in micro-choices (tracing runes, slow key turn), giving her a consistent, usable edge. Interiority stays concrete—her racing heart against steady hands—yet never deepens into contradiction or flaw that could complicate the final sealing. The grandmother link supplies emotional fuel, but the automaton is the one that pressures her; Mira’s own stakes plateau after the first third. Competence is balanced with “barely learning,” but no misbelief or internal cost surfaces to shadow the victory, so the endurance lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the contradiction between clinical certainty and the glowing tooth is felt in her body. The final decision—to excavate, document, and search—grows organically from her lifelong doubt and is paid for in the moment she forgives herself for not believing. Micro-choices (digging with bare hands, holding the hollow femur to moonlight) reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. The only slack is the single-beat appearance of the laughing child, which slightly dilutes the cost of her vow.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s grief-rooted interiority is concrete—her arthritic climb, the satchel’s weight, the emerald glass held like relic. The contradiction between polishing beauty and nursing loss is embodied in every wrist-curl of the cloth; no diagnostic self-talk, only the ache of joints against stone. The final act of placing Lila’s fragment at the spiral’s heart is micro-choice that forecloses keeping the memory private; the cost is the relinquishing of solitary possession. Still, the daughter stays off-stage memory only, so relationship-as-crucible and secondary-pressure bullets are NA; headcount compliance costs no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s watchful-dreamer trait is shown through pattern sketching and attention to micro-detail, but her interiority stays safe: “she worked quietly” repeats rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The pendant transfer is credible, yet the moment of relinquishment is externally calm—no visible cost tremor or hesitation that would foreclose a path. Thea’s guilt is asserted more than embodied; her single whispered line carries little distinct voice. Both sisters reach acceptance, but the emotional price feels inferred, not enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her palm against the shell, the ache of abandoned novels—but the epiphany (“hope isn’t a destination”) is articulated by a spectral double rather than wrested from her own embodied contradiction, softening the cost. Still, the spiral shell’s warmth in her hand shows micro-choice under pressure. The final resolve is foreshadowed by grandmother’s dementia-etched grip, so renunciation feels earned. Character count is kept legible; choreography never blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“trembling with exhaustion and wonder,” the vine tightening around her wrist—showing contradictory fear/duty without label-speak. The final renunciation of perfect success (“single morning could not undo decades”) is earned and costly. The “whimsical tinkerer” tag is stated more than dramatized; only one micro-choice (the cracked singing) is invention-adjacent. Net result: strong, but not quite the 9-band because the vocational trait never complicates or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied—fingers arranging twigs, breath crystallizing—yet her contradictory impulse (rush vs. patience) is told in summary, not enacted in-scene. The copper plate’s childhood link is anchored in micro-choice (carrying it seventeen years), but the “why now” spark that converts patience to sealing action arrives as abstract motive, not visible beat. Earned stillness lands: she climbs out aching, cost paid, path foreclosed. Hairline slip: the heartbeat-map premise is declared, never tested against a live heartbeat, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is precise and profession-specific—her locksmith’s habit of "understanding mechanisms" and "filing by candlelight" grounds every beat. The contradiction between her need to explain and her vow "never to explain it away" is held in tension but never dramatized in a single forced choice; the ending is memory rather than renunciation, so the cost is felt but not foregrounded. Emotions stay embodied (trembling hands, heart-as-metronome) and avoid label-speak. The absence of another on-page character keeps status and relationship crucibles inactive; the score caps just under the 9+ gate because the final stance is crystallized but not tested against an external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—“boundary-lessly trapped within her gift” dramatizes the fractal invasion of self. The weaving of external griefs into her own psyche is a visceral, embodied micro-choice each time she orients the loom. Her final reclamation of name is earned because each collected burden visibly anchors the pattern and lessens her diffusion. The only gap is a slight diagnostic tint—“fractals… calcify her mind”—but it is quickly followed by sensory consequence, so the flaw stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marguerite’s interior contradiction—grief that must be shaped yet never vanishes—is dramatized through the rhythmic micro-choices of carving, palms warming, tea steam rising; each beat externalizes the same contained fear Viktor once wore. The endurance of continuing the studio, teaching others, carving another lion is earned by 27 years of watching, so the final quiet “perhaps this had always been enough” lands as credible renunciation rather than self-help tag. No diagnostic label-speak; even “grief” is kept physical. Flaw: late-single mention of “students” never presses her in scene, so status dynamics stay hypothetical.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to survival while still yearning to create—are embodied in her tactile handling of the camera wheel and her willingness to speak the unsayable (“I pretended the stopping was a choice”). The ghost functions as an external pressure, forcing a micro-choice that reconfigures her stance, so the arc is earned. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of self-erasement and accepts the ache of continuity. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete—her fingers closing on the brass fragment, the tablet sketches—and her stoic-wonder tone stays particular. The intern badge relic anchors her identity under pressure, but the “equations for hope” tilt toward label-speak; tightening one sentence to show contradiction inside the wonder would lift this to 8+. The closure choice (present the plan, risk failure) is earned; the sextant warms her palm as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound scribe vs. buried composer—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (kneeling, stylus on parchment) rather than alternating summaries. The final decision to draft silent music carries visible cost: she weeps, acknowledging the “terrifying burden of hope,” earned by seventeen years of enforced silence. Interiority stays sensory, not therapeutic: “tiny voices trapped in quartz” is idiosyncratic perception, not label-speak. Flaw complicates choice: her past abandonment of music directly shapes the stakes of returning to it now.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s contradictory hunger to venerate and dismantle her father’s legend is embodied in the tactile handling of the sundial and her steady salvage of the waterproof case—each micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of curiosity over filial loyalty. Interiority stays concrete and avoids label-speak; the moment she “felt the serene upheaval wash through her” is saved from abstraction by its immediate pairing with the physical chain in the water. The letter’s confession could tilt into explanatory exposition, yet its timing after the salvage keeps the father’s voice a secondary pressure rather than a retroactive patch. Closure is an earned stasis: she forecloses the option of simple condemnation and accepts the weight of unspoken truth, cost visible in the darkened sundial she still carries.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s patience is credibly embodied in the slow decoding of the rope, but her interiority stays safely on one note; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her resolve, so the final “she would not let that happen” feels pre-declared rather than earned under pressure. The fulgurite necklace is a concrete cue for inherited duty, yet its only micro-choice is a concluding touch to the throat—insufficient to reveal a hierarchy of values when the stakes never seriously diverge from her opening goal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her ritual of “projecting presence” is embodied, not abstract, and the crimson thread circling her finger literalizes grief under pressure. The micro-choice to braid the strand into her hair crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the fantasy of reunion. Interior contradiction flickers only once (“she had never understood why…until now”), but the prior eleven years of practice earn the epiphany. Voice stays individual, never sliding into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aldric’s gaunt obsession, three-day grime, and “tears cutting tracks” embody his motive; the final laugh-salt-joy triad crystallizes a credible renunciation of sterile perfection. Micro-choices—pressing forehead to cold glass, trembling hands threading silver wire—keep interiority concrete. The only slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“This is flawed genesis”) without immediate embodied cost; still, contradiction pulses in scene and the hybrid creature lands as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—firefighter muscle memory, the click of the coin against glass, the way kelp peace hums in her molars. The contradiction between “extinguish his legacy” and collecting heat-remembering sand is dramatized, not narrated. Final stance crystallizes when she pockets the jar: a micro-choice that visibly forecloses vengeance and endorses transformation. Earned cost is felt, though the father letter beat is summarized rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s “luminous skeptic” contradiction stays active—she distrusts magic yet guides the city with her own inner light—but interiority drifts into label-speak (“skepticism warred with hope”). The sacrificial release of her mother’s laughter is earned, yet the absence of any on-page relationship or status opposition keeps the arc intimate rather than crucible-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Veloris’s memory-keeper identity is vivid and embodied (“carried their sorrows like seeds”), but her final turn from observer to transmitter is stated more than dramatized; we see no interior contradiction or micro-choice that costs her something visible on the page, so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her wish to honor each Hendricks individually vs. the spectral mentor’s demand that she feel their connected absence—are dramatized in concrete sketching and ribbon-tying beats. Interiority is particular (monarch wing-beat as metronome, poem titles as family shorthand). The final micro-choice—adding black ribbon to the braid—costs her the comfort of individual tribute and is legible on-page. Slight over-articulation of grief theory keeps this from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s lived-in ritualism and embodied guilt anchor every动作; her contradictory wish to both punish and serve herself plays out in the micro-choice to carve the rake handle while the pendulum hangs. The thirty-seven-year repetition is shown, not told, through calloused grooves in rock and memory. Interiority stays concrete—“seventeen seconds resting lighter” is the closest she allows to absolution, and even that is framed as physiology, not hug. No other characters press her, so relationship crucible is waived; her conflict is with time itself and she wins a sliver, believably.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s calm, grave-tending pragmatism is vividly embodied (“gardener’s hands finding each rung”) and consistently motivates her patience with the tapestry; the final quiet smile and decision to dig tomorrow crystallize a credible, low-key change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only minor flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never hesitates or risks failure—so the arc is more steady revelation than tested character. Still, the inherited vocation and star-lit acceptance feel specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—pride in honest ignorance vs terror of authoring futures—drives every beat; the “gift” vs “call” line crystallizes it. Embodied cost arrives when she finally lifts the quill: steady hand after visible dread, a micro-choice that forecloses pure spectatorship. Professional trait (ignorance cartographer) shapes perception and tactics throughout; no stock labels. Flaw is active, not hedged, and the ending renounces certainty with felt humility.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Helena’s interiority is textured through music-anchored memory and ritualized gesture (amber dial, blanket pull) that externalize a disciplined, risk-accruing stance; the “thistled calm” line crystallizes her acceptance of permanent danger. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only recalled, so the cost is conceptually but not dramaturgically felt at the closure beat. Still, her vocation as copyist seeds the lyric-code tactic and the final image of composing tomorrow’s tale, giving the arc credible continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers mixing ash and charcoal, the mask warming against her face—yet the moment she “wants to crystallize this fleeting emotion” remains abstract, not dramatized as a contradictory impulse. The inherited duty and her quiet acceptance earn a credible endurance, but the lack of a micro-choice that costs her something immediate keeps the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—rational archivist vs. secret doubter—stays live in every beat; the quiet choice to cache the cog rather than confront the zealots crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him any hope of surface acceptance. His “abrasive calm” is embodied in the way he palms verdigris brass, not declared. One flaw: the phrase “wannabe philosopher” is repeated but never tested by an on-page challenge that could falsify his claim, so the arc is more stance-set than stance-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret’s interior contradiction—resigned yet still reaching—is embodied in the first trembling zither note; Darius’s defensive posture and slow hand-release show anger ceding to need without therapeutic gloss. Their micro-choice to touch the strings together crystallizes a value hierarchy: legacy over despair. Cost is legible: she risks renewed grief, he risks being seen as soft. Relationship shift is on the page: teacher becomes student and vice-versa in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren’s grief-tasting gift and outlaw status are vivid, but interiority tilts toward abstract labels—“tasted a grandmother’s laughter”—rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. The seed-planting beat shows micro-choice, yet the final vow feels foregone; no interior friction complicates her resolve. Cost is asserted (“they would come with burners”) rather than felt in a body-fear beat. Still, her sensory genius and clandestine purpose read as singular, not stereotype, earning mid-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived; it never complicates her tactics or forces a visible mistake under pressure. The daughter-grief motive lands late and is summarized, not embodied, so the emotional cost feels borrowed rather than earned. Still, her choice to open the tower’s memory bank is cleanly motivated by backstory and crystallizes a believable shift from watcher to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s “creeping normality noticer” identity is concrete—she tracks foreclosures, names dust motes, moves objects—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the final realization that attention itself is sanctification is lovely yet costless, so the arc feels more observed than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veris's motive—waiting for someone who can bear the knowledge she carries—remains crystal-clear, and her micro-choice to offer the ampoule, knowing it will unravel Mira's grief, is an embodied, costly act. Mira's contradictory impulses (clutch certainty vs. swallow wonder) are dramatized in a single, tactile beat: trembling hands accepting glass that pulses with her brother's peace. The interiority avoids label-speak; grief is tasted as copper and salt. The only limit is that Mira's moral calculus is sketched more than fully lived; we feel the invitation, not yet the price of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s grim optimism is lived-in: she keeps climbing after “centuries,” chalks equations on the very steps that imprison her. The interior contradiction—hope against despair—drives every micro-choice (roll the dice, kneel, press palm to crack). The final Earned Stasis (she keeps climbing, chip smoother, grief-engine humming) is fully earned by her prior obsession with crystallizing regret. Only minor leakage: “grim optimist” is named once in opening exposition rather than dramatized first.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s contradictory mix of exhaustion and methodical hope is shown through paint-smeared jeans, sweat on her brow, and the trembling hand that lifts the glowing brush; her interiority is precise, never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling. The emotional stakes of proving kindness remembered feel embodied and proportional to the story’s scale, and her final smile costs her the sleep she no longer has, earning the Earned Stasis. Micro-choices—opening the laptop, wiping her hands, stepping back from the canvas—chart a visible hierarchy of values under pressure. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status tests are waived; characterization never flattens into stereotype or label.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—museum-eloquence against grotto-despair—is lived in every gesture; the emerald lens pressed to a child’s bread is a perfect micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The ache of preservation is embodied, not labeled. No epiphany is declared; instead, the final “perfect preservation of form” joke lets us feel the cost of endurance. The only bar to 8+ is that the children remain largely undifferentiated, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alaric’s interiority is vivid (“clocks that ran backward, so wrongness felt like home”), embodied grief drives every micro-choice, and the yoyo-cast that snatches his daughter’s laughter crystallizes a cost that justifies his vanished future. The flaw: the daughter remains off-page memory, so the relationship crucible is off-stage; the only live pressure is between man and time, not between people. Still, his flaw—obsessive retro-engineering—compounds to the exit beat, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete—heartbeat-fear as “second heart,” the ash-taste of victory—yet the moment she consumes fear is slightly under-cooked; we are told “it was smaller” rather than shown her corporeal ingestion. Her contradictory impulses (repulsion / complicity with the advisor) play out in live gesture—pin clasped, dictionary tucked—earning the renunciation of fear. The advisor’s shifting face and hunger-tenderness are individuated, but his final motive (“I feed on their corpses”) is delivered as declarative lore, not dramatized pressure. Still, the micro-choice to smile “with borrowed teeth” crystallizes a hierarchy of values—survival through seduction—closing the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prophet’s interiority is lyrically dense but remains observational; she never makes a high-stakes choice that visibly costs her something. The mallet-handling beats are tactile, yet her stance toward the new wreck is static appreciation rather than dilemma. Without a tightening fork where refusal or risk is dramatized, the arc is a steady-state meditation, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s quiet compulsion to question is shown through tactile ritual—tracing her own shell, decoding knot-scripts—so her final squeeze through the rusted gate feels inevitable. The shell-map on her back and the inherited whistle anchor interiority in concrete objects, avoiding abstract self-labeling. One flaw: the seventeen-year mapping span is told, not embodied, so the depth of obsession is asserted more than dramatized. Still, her decision to row away carries visible cost—she scrapes flesh on rust and forsakes the only home she has known, earning the story’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motivation—truth at any cost—drives every beat; the photograph/upload choice is a credible, earned renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“golden borders depicting serpents swallowing their own tails”) and emotionally embodied without therapy-speak. The lone weakness: no contradictory impulse on-page; she never seriously hesitates, so the internal conflict is declarative, not simultaneously enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina’s double life is cleanly etched: daylight surveyor, midnight “archeologist of abandoned dreams.” The contradiction—stoic instrumentality vs. covert tenderness—shows in micro-choices (wading chest-deep, cradling oilcloth) and drives every beat. No higher because her final gesture (leaving a third note) merely repeats prior pattern; the emotional ceiling is already tapped, so renunciation lacks new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s quiet, cataloguing nature is vivid and consistent; the stamp-in-hand moment embodies her values. The interior contradiction—yearning for truth yet fearing the library’s erasure—never sharpens into a visible micro-cost: she never risks anything tangible (time, safety, reputation) to reach the ledger. The final “earned stasis” is gentle but registers mainly as emotional confirmation, not foreclosure with measurable price. Still, her perceptual signature and embodied stillness give her memorable individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s grief is embodied in the folding ritual and the midnight climb; the lantern-capture choice grows credibly from craft obsession. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “grief cracked open like an egg, spilling not darkness but dawn” drifts into therapeutic epiphany rather than lived contradiction, blunting the earned edge.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yara’s survivor-incompleteness is rendered through body-level memory (breath fogging the port, copper taste) and micro-choices—resetting breakers, recording coordinates with trembling fingers—so motive stays visible in action. The geode’s shift from “intangibly tangible” to “impossibly, unbearably real” crystallizes her earned stance: she forecloses the option of forgetting by choosing to keep hunting. One interior contradiction pulses throughout—her drive to prove deaths were not inevitable while admitting resurrection is impossible—keeping her from tidy sainthood. Cost is legible in the final image: she returns to equations knowing the answer may never come, the geode now a weight she refuses to set down.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s drive to decode her father’s frequency is credible and emotionally grounded. The “perpetually surprised” trait surfaces only once, lacking embodiment or cost, so it reads as label-only. Her handing-over of both chips at the end is a micro-choice that crystallizes her shift from search to continuation, earning partial credit. Interiority is concrete when she spots the star-trail alignment; elsewhere it slips toward explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.4)
    Interiority is razor-sharp: “she had swallowed her confession like a stone” embodies guilt physically. Contradictory impulses collide in-scene as she both caresses and recoils from the carved hand. The final renunciation—vowing to reverse her own forged erasures—pays off every prior micro-choice with felt cost. Voice never slips into diagnostic cant; instead, shame is tasted, weighed, carried.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—thumb on brass, sleepless nights writing letters—and her refusal to let her brother speak yet shows a hierarchy of values. The drawer-pull talisman anchors her professional identity without slipping into nostalgia. Brother’s gaunt face and silence imply transformation, but his POV is absent, so the relational crucible is only half-lit; still, her choice to walk the “road between apology and forgiveness” carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s guilt-paralysis is embodied in the brass compass dead-weight and the bite of November water; her micro-choice to keep paddling after each utility-pole sighting turns interior contradiction into visible tactic. The final decision not to throw the compass overboard earns its emotional cost through the causal chain of memory cues (Marcus’s shanty, father’s scratched North Star). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, “merrily melancholic” is shown through the simultaneous tear-and-smile beat. Still, the stakes plateau after the fourth paragraph—no new tactical loss or adaptation—so the arc crests just short of higher-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s amnesiac con-artist-turned-seeker anchors every beat; the contradictory pull between blank memory and phantom guilt is embodied in the cold water and tightening chest. The micro-choice to wade in rather than flee crystallizes a hierarchy of values—self-reckoning over safety—paying the felt cost of cold panic. Elena’s jaded exhaustion is a believable crucible that forces Marcus toward empathy, not vengeance. Only the stated date “2089” lacks prior character-bound grounding, a hairline motivation slip that keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“terror and peace existed simultaneously in her chest, the way stars burn cold from a distance”—and her choice to surrender humanity is anchored in three years of refusal. The brother relationship is only remembered, not staged, so status/relationship bullets stay inactive; still, her micro-choice under the phoenix’s price lands with visible cost. The metamorphosis is accepted rather than externally tested, capping intensity just below the 8.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Morrigan’s interiority is rich, her contradictory impulses (desire to reclaim lost time vs fear it is gone) are embodied in trembling lungs and burning climb; the moment she unfastens Iris’s cord knots up her love and cost in one gesture, earning her final restoration. Grandmother and Iris remain off-page, so relationship/status bullets do not apply; the solo POV is coherent and specific. The flaw of exhausted self-erasure is lived-in, not labeled, and drives every micro-choice until the card-door opens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei Lin’s interior contradiction—rage buried beneath engineered pacifism—drives every beat; the moment she admits “I am still angry” while stitching her own photograph is a visceral, embodied pivot that forecloses the path of pure equanimity with visible cost. The gravitationally lighter trait is not ornament but kinetic: her rising body literalizes the release of suppressed shadow, making the internal external. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the solitary crucible is sufficient. TheEarned Stasis at the end—she lets the needle rest—carries reconciled darkness, yet the cap stays at 8.7 because the rage-to-forgiveness turn, while credible, is compressed into a single paragraph rather than compounded through earlier micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam’s interior contradiction—yearning to “understand transformation” while compulsively freezing moments—grounds every beat; the final release of the fireflies externalizes a visible cost (empty jars, unfootprinted sand). The philanthropic past is summary, never dramatized, so the “Saint/Fool” duality stays abstract and caps depth. Still, her micro-choices on the beach (open, open, open) accumulate to an earned renunciation that forecloses her archive and leaves her literally lighter.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s vigilance is credibly lived-in—keys at belt, seventeen years of routine—but the story withholds any moment where that vigilance actually wavers or costs her something on the page; the “small smile” is the only visible interior shift and it arrives after victory, not during risk. Her calm inventiveness is asserted rather than dramatized (no on-scene improvisation). The twelve recruited conspirators remain off-stage, so relationship pressure and status crucible are absent; the story leans on summary monologue instead of embodied contradiction under tension. Still, her locked-silent stoicism feels consistent and the final renunciation—continuing to play loyal jailer—carries a muted, believable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Meren’s contradictory impulses—fleeing knowledge yet chasing it under world-collapse—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices: arranging rocks, gripping slick stone, deciding to pour star dust. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“weathered hands,” “slick stone,” “seal-skin pouch”) rather than diagnostic. The final harnessing is earned: seventeen years of scraping meteorites plus grandmother’s promise create visible cost. Only flaw: relationship/status crucible unused (no second on-page character), capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s contradictory silence vs. need to speak is embodied in the trembling start-button press; the envelope-choice crystallizes a visible cost—seven lost years—landing as Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“storm-kissed wonder,” voice “raspy”) without diagnostic labels. Flaw: the mother photograph arrives late, so the filial wound feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s “turn questions into destinations” motive is stated repeatedly but only dramatized at the very end; the duel with Krell is too short to reveal contradictory impulses or cost. The mechanical arm grants competence yet no visible flaw or limit complicates her tactics. Interiority drifts into thesis-speak (“philosophy without destination was merely elegant procrastination”) instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“she molts personalities monthly now”—and her embodied rituals (prizing open the false bottom, touching spines like prayer) dramatize a hierarchy of values where survival and beauty collide. The monthly shedding is shown to cost her continuity of self, a price legible in the cracked luminous laugh that closes the piece. Ezra’s quieter presence still forces status shifts: his late entrance with crate and pennies rescues her from solitary stoicism and re-anchors their alliance. All prior traits converge in the final beat—whoever she becomes next will still risk patrols to keep the poems, an earned renunciation that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief-struck vigilance and the micro-choice to weave the compass-tones into her wedding song are vividly embodied; the contradictory impulses (keep waiting vs. act) coexist in-scene. The final hand-on-keys moment crystallizes a credible renunciation of solitude with visible cost. Interiority steers clear of therapy-speak; only minor softness: we’re told “strategically creative” rather than shown it shaping earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yara’s interior contradiction—trained skeptic who half-believes the ridge—drives every beat; her tactile micro-choices (testing soil, pressing seed to forehead) keep motivation anchored. The final “luminous doubt” renunciation is earned by the dream descent and costs her seventeen-year vocation. No other character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is waived. Minor softness: “luminous doubt” drifts toward label-speak in the last paragraph, blunting full 9-entry.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s interiority is concrete—compass warmth, lace tracing—and her contradictory guilt/need is embodied. The micro-choice to point at the apology knot lands with cost: “I was wrong” spoken without words. Grandmother’s trembling answering touch shows genuine struggle under pressure. Voice stays distinct; no therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is precise and embodied—her grief manifests through tactile engagement with dust, slides, and ruins rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (kneeling, pocketing a slide, deciding to demolish) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss and science. The contradiction between her cosmic-scale work and intimate mourning feels organic, not contrived. Final renunciation of “drama” is earned through gradual sedimentation of meaning, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, adaptive posture, and tactile memory of glasswork reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation of patronage feels earned through micro-choices (studying frost, decoding the ledger) that align with her craft-based worldview. The “scorched testament” epiphany arises from concrete sensory triggers, not abstraction. Only minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the closing paragraph (“seeds of light planted deep…”), which borders on diagnostic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Margaret’s motivation—translating silence into music through heat-mapping—is rooted in trauma yet forward-looking, and her micro-choices (striking tuning forks, transcribing thermal data) reveal a hierarchy of values: creation over recovery, observation over despair. Her internal conflict is embodied, not labeled (“couldn’t hear the ocean… without drowning”), and her final hum, though silent to her ears, registers as warmth—a physical echo of emotional re-engagement. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; grief is shown through blues on a screen, not named. Her endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: she accepts permanent silence but refuses creative death.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ezra’s inadvertent stubbornness and weary compassion are embodied, not declared—his micro-choices (keeping the lens, descending into the library) arise from consistent traits. His internal contradiction—carrying others’ grief while avoiding his own—is resolved through action, not epiphany. The final Earned Stasis (“let the chased silence catch him”) carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, oceanic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her belief in “gently persistent” intergenerational communion shapes every choice, from ringing the bell to routing food drops. Yusuf’s sullenness masks vulnerability, revealed through micro-choices like examining the bell. Their dynamic forces mutual growth without sentimentality. The final photograph triggers no epiphany but a quiet reaffirmation, embodying Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei-Lin’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, obsession, and spiritual curiosity manifest through tactile choices (adjusting the lens, guiding the woman) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation stems from a past-life memory that feels earned, not expositional, and her final micro-choice to “photograph breath” crystallizes her identity with resonant cost. The old woman’s secondary presence applies immediate emotional pressure without diluting focus. Both characters avoid stereotype through idiosyncratic perception and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s retrocognitive condition manifests through embodied, contradictory impulses—experiencing her daughter’s funeral before her birth, for instance—that culminate in a final choice that feels both transcendent and inevitable. Her micro-choices (carrying the fragment, unwrapping it at the knot) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding time over preserving linear selfhood. The cost—dissolving into temporal fabric—is viscerally rendered, not abstracted. No diagnostic label-speak; trauma and longing are filtered through botanical and geometric metaphors rooted in her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grace is “staggering” yet unfeigned, her strategic patience coexists with desperation. Her micro-choices (decoding keys, appealing to the scout’s hunger) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The scout’s internal war is rendered with minimal but precise gestures, avoiding caricature. Both characters feel like individuals shaped by their world, not archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s synesthetic perception, grief, and professional obsession cohere into a psychologically precise interiority. Her micro-choices—carrying the glass fragment, calibrating the receiver—are charged with emotional cost. The final weeping is not catharsis but endurance, an Earned Stasis that forecloses reconciliation yet affirms understanding. Her flaw (seeking sonic fossils of betrayal) directly enables her method and deepens her isolation without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in her mother’s stolen portraits and a moral stance against hoarding beauty—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (thief vs. liberator) manifests in micro-choices: the decoy jar, the disarming smile, the orphanage plan. The final beat crystallizes her arc without over-explaining, and her “quietly savvy” trait enables tactical decisions with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her narration habit, tactile handling of the bookmark, and emotional calibration feel specific and earned. Her contradiction between inherited skill and rejected despair fuels credible agency. The final choice to seek community carries palpable cost: abandoning hard-won solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and hope emerge through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marla’s contradictory impulses—fear versus professional courage—are embodied and active throughout the scene, not summarized. Her micro-choices (offering the shell, lowering defenses) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Sandra’s motivation is rooted in sibling rivalry and erasure, making her theft tragically coherent rather than cartoonish. However, Marla’s instant decryption of childhood scribbles strains plausibility under stress, slightly undermining the earned nature of her triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle’s motivation—mild obsession with mapping the void—is embodied through persistent action, not summary. Her interiority is specific (“quiet persistence of water wearing through stone”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice (charting darkness despite personal cost) is earned by prior causality, with bleeding fingers and flaking gold marking tangible sacrifice. Flaws and limits feel authentic, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit-7’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception (“snow fell in slow spirals past the crystalline pillars, each flake another thought the robot janitor could not quite trace”) and micro-choices (setting down the broom feels “revolutionary”). Its motivation—seeking the origin of thought—is rooted in accumulated human fragments, not abstract yearning. The final act of playing the violin crystallizes its transformation from janitor to vessel, with visible cost: eternal recurrence without escape. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. wonder) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira and Theo are rendered with precise interior contradiction—Mira’s protective distance versus her yearning for connection, Theo’s guilt versus his need to be seen. Their micro-choices (offering the lens, adding a second figure) emerge organically from established flaws and history. The relationship functions as crucible: mistrust calcified by past betrayal is thawed through reciprocal vulnerability, not exposition. Final gestures carry visible cost—Mira relinquishes her observational shield, Theo exposes his shame—making their Earned Stasis deeply credible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Esther’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her “mended deception” coexists with pragmatic devotion, and her micro-choices (polishing marbles, bringing the pot into the maze) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in stubborn presence over mystical gift. Elena’s flat resignation contrasts authentically, and their dialogue carries subtext without therapy-speak. The final choice—to close her fingers around the cracked marble—is earned by Esther’s revelation and grounded in embodied emotion, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grease-streaked hands, kinship with machines and cloudweavers, and quiet defiance of Dr. Vasquez reveal a self forged in isolation and precision. Her motivation arises organically from years of sky-bound observation, not abstract theory. The final choice to seal the deck and carry her proof alone feels inevitable, charged with the cost of solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s motivation—driven by professional invisibility, insomnia, and obsession—is rooted in consistent traits that intensify under pressure. Her micro-choices (decoding ciphers, photographing stains, prying open the panel) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: physical discomfort, emotional vulnerability, and risk to her reputation. Interiority is concrete (“numb fingers,” “lantern light harsh against romantic gloom”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of anonymity is earned through prior causality, transforming her marginal status into moral agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassandra’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: her contradiction—between duty to the Consortium and moral refusal—is embodied in micro-choices like swallowing the vision and tracing the smudged lily. Her fault-tolerant design isn’t just stated but enacted through hesitation, silence, and precise emotional calibration under feverish stress. Mira serves as a crucible without overreaching; their brief exchange sharpens Cassandra’s renunciation. The final decision to withhold prophecy feels earned, costly, and deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—rooted in swallowed truth and skepticism—is embodied through tactile choices (photographing beads, counting) and internal contradiction (dismissing spirits yet hunting personal ghosts). His emotional arc crystallizes without therapy-speak; the amber bead triggers visceral recognition, not exposition. The final renunciation (“She hadn’t run”) forecloses denial with palpable cost. His recklessness matures into careful witness, aligning flaw, action, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is deeply embodied and consistent: her “gripping reality loosely” manifests in micro-choices like letting shelves collapse without intervention. Her motivation—to witness without judgment—is dramatized through tactile engagement with decay, not abstract declaration. The origami swan functions as a mirror of her philosophy, not a prop. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through moss, water, and crumbling stone.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “softly adaptive” nature manifests in micro-choices (adjusting her expression, offering the locket) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Maya’s fear and vulnerability feel authentic, not diagnostic. Their dialogue carries subtext and distinct voice, and the mother’s professional identity informs but doesn’t override her emotional reality. The final renunciation—releasing the locket as an act of trust—feels earned by consistent character logic.

    Mei Lin’s motivation evolves with crystalline clarity—from Cold War operative to accidental prophet—and her final renunciation (handing over the specs) is earned through decades of interior tension. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. obsolescence, secrecy vs. revelation) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she removes the glasses. The micro-choice to write the journalist’s fortune before meeting her reveals a hierarchy of values: truth-telling over anonymity, orchestration over concealment.

    Elena’s internal conflict—certainty as armor versus doubt as space—is embodied through visceral physical detail (shadows writhing beneath skin, trembling) and credible psychological regression under possession. Marcus’s micro-choices (circling, painting, looping questions) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, inquiry over dogma. Their dialogue avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise from action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)

    Vera’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her numbness, professional precision, and vulnerability coexist in embodied contradictions (e.g., “static electricity” as emotional radar). Her final choice to retain her work but infuse it with empathy feels earned through the blotter petal’s catalytic effect. The transformation avoids epiphany clichés by rooting change in sensory and electrical specificity. Her flaw—immunity to counterfeit emotion—is both profession and prison, making her reconfiguration credible and costly.

    Marina’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “whimsically attentive” nature, inherited curiosity, and broker’s precision shape her choices with emotional and moral texture. Her motivation stems credibly from familial legacy and personal ethics, escalating to meaningful action. Elias is rendered with specificity (barnacle-scraped steel, locket-clutching), but secondary pressure is light; his role serves Marina’s arc more than exerting independent force.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation is rooted in visceral, embodied grief—her inability to recall Theo’s laugh drives her toward a flawed but credible epistemology of emotion.

The transformation feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s insomnia, artistic compulsion, and emotional exhaustion are embodied with precise, non-diagnostic language (“paint-stained fingers,” “perpetual twilight state”). Her micro-choice to follow rain trails—despite fear of ghosts—feels earned by her accumulated frustration with failed paintings.

The final exchange of paintings for journals crystallizes their shared quest with credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s internal contradiction—between her lifelong reliance on foresight and her sudden blindness—is embodied in precise, sensory-rich choices (e.g., walking “blind” yet feeling “liberation”).

Her micro-choices (checking the watch, testing the punch, stepping through the door) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

Her motivation stems from generational inheritance, not exposition, and her final act—closing the notepad after Dawn 744—is a quiet renunciation that forecloses no path but affirms her vocation with palpable cost: eternal return to silence while the town forgets. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in synesthetic perception. The only hairline slip: secondary characters exist only as off-page echoes, slightly limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief swallowed like poison, memory as tactile sediment—and her micro-choices (climbing, listening, preserving the label) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in erasure. Her transformation from trusting documents to trusting “the texture of memories” feels earned, with visible cost in lost identity and social death.

Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile perception (“memories rippled through her fingertips”).

No emotional summarizing; even his tears at dawn feel earned, not sentimental.

Her final choice (“I’m sorry…”) is earned by prior causality: the shard’s revelation reframes her mother’s intent, making forgiveness legible without erasing cost. The unsent letters motif crystallizes as self-confrontation, not therapy-speak. Flaws drive inevitable error (silence born of fear), and the resolution accepts its emotional price.

    Mira’s contradictory impulses—between control and surrender, curiosity and caution—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., trembling hands, deliberate breath) rather than summarized. Her flaw (the burden of phantom timelines) directly shapes her final renunciation of mastery, making the Earned Stasis deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradictions: his solitude is both refuge and burden, his receptivity to “borrowed memories” a blend of compulsion and devotion. His micro-choice to write in the logbook—transforming witness into participant—is earned by decades of quiet archiving and aligns with his established ethos. The final act carries visible cost: he assumes emotional responsibility for a stranger’s love, breaking his lifelong pattern of passive reception.

    The witness’s interiority is concrete and mythically embodied—her bare feet on eroded stone, her instinctive path through the spiral—yet avoids diagnostic label-speak.

    Maya’s internal conflict—between helping others and fleeing connection—is embodied in precise gestures (brushing lichen, holding the rock) and crystallizes in her final offer to stay.

    Mira’s motivation—preserving tradition through active guardianship—is consistent, embodied in her arthritic descent into the spring and her cracked but determined voice. Her internal conflict between grief and duty manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous pressure: “her rebellion had always been about preservation rather than destruction.” The telepathic gift feels earned through trauma, not convenience, and her final choice to plant the seed carries generational weight.

    Mira’s motivation—rooted in grief, curiosity, and scholarly inheritance—is consistent and intensifies credibly as stakes rise.

    Morrigan’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her exhaustion, fractured time-perception, and maternal guilt manifest through tactile details (cracked saucer, ink-stained cards) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choice to unfasten Iris’s cord is earned by years of accumulated absence and the glade’s ritual logic. The contradiction between desperate hope and self-doubt operates simultaneously in every beat. Final recovery isn’t epiphany but reintegration, with visible cost: three years of love reclaimed only after surrendering the token of her daughter’s trust.

    Mei Lin’s interiority is vividly embodied—her suppressed rage, gravitational lightness tied to emotion, and micro-choices (stitching, whispering forgiveness) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her steadfast pacifism isn’t passive but actively wrestled with, culminating in the earned admission “I am still angry.” The final renunciation of suppression for truth carries visible cost: decades of avoidance undone in a single act that enables closure.

    Miriam’s motivation—understanding “the texture of transformation”—is embodied in precise, contradictory choices: giving away fortunes yet keeping jars, seeking release yet clinging to memory. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels (“grief became gratitude” is poetic but grounded in sensory recollection). The final renunciation—releasing the fireflies—is earned by decades of dispossession and crystallizes her arc without sentimentality. Flaws (idealism bordering on self-erasure) complicate her agency and carry visible cost: destitution, anonymity, emotional isolation.

    Maren’s motivation—rooted in seventeen years of vigilant service and decoded truth—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through concrete perception (“shadows that had suddenly grown teeth”) and micro-choices (carrying the quill holder, leaving doors unlocked). The final act—a quiet descent into loyal guise after igniting revolution—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: she surrenders personal recognition to become an invisible catalyst. Her competence is balanced by patience, not omniscience, and her flaw (hyper-vigilance turned subversive) drives the plot without safety-hedging.

    Meren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear of seeing, her grandmother’s promise, her lifelong evasion—all converge in micro-choices that feel inevitable yet costly. Her precognitive curse isn’t just stated; it actively constrains her agency, forcing her into passive observation until the star dust grants a rare moment of safe understanding. The final decision to act (“harness the sacred patterns”) earns its weight through decades of implied struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in weathered hands, seal-skin pouches, and silver eels catching auroral light.

    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silence, scars, and censored rage feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (not opening the envelope, pressing the timer) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final act of speaking emerges credibly from accumulated pressure, not epiphany. Flaws like self-isolation compound meaningfully, and her transformation avoids tidy resolution.

    Elara’s motivation—to turn questions into destinations—is embodied in her mechanical arm, fencing skill, and decoding of the sundial. Her internal contradiction (philosopher-warrior) drives every choice, and her final confrontation crystallizes her values with visible cost: shattered teacups, exposed deceit, and the burden of truth. Krell’s “diplomatically fierce” demeanor applies immediate pressure, forcing Elara to act rather than debate. The mechanical arm isn’t just a trait—it enables precise parries that shape tactics and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s molting identities are embodied through tactile memory (sorting books, handling the tin) rather than diagnostic labels, and her contradictions—fierce Vera vs. soft Delia, yet all loving Ezra—are active in scene. Her final choice to continue rebuilding despite uncertainty is earned by prior causality: each personality leaves traces that cumulatively affirm commitment. Ezra’s presence pressures her stance without resolving it, preserving cost. The only flaw: minor flattening in the “all of them love Ezra” line risks summary over embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her grief manifests through ritual (winding the broken clock), strategic creativity (decoding film into music), and refusal of passive mourning. Her final choice to play their song as a beacon is earned by seventeen years of waiting transformed into active navigation. The reunion avoids sentimentality; her voice “thick with steely longing finally permitted to soften” captures emotional complexity without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (threading film, altering melody) reveal a hierarchy of values where love demands ingenuity, not resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Yara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her doubt “glowed within her like phosphorescence,” her empirical training wars with ancestral intuition, and her final choice emerges from credible contradiction. The seed-planting micro-choice feels earned, not epiphanic, and her renunciation of verification as sole truth-teller carries tangible cost: surrendering control to uncertainty. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, tears and blackened fingers dramatize transformation. The grandmother’s off-page presence exerts pressure without diluting Yara’s solitary crucible.

    Mei’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—grief, anger, longing coexist without tidy resolution. Her micro-choices (touching the compass, tracing lace) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The grandmother’s nonverbal agency—trembling finger selecting a loop—earns their reconciliation without speech. Flaws (silence as self-protection) directly shape the cost: fifty years lost, now reclaimed through invented language.
