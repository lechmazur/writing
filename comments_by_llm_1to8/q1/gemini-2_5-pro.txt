    Kaelen's motivation to "discover purpose in the pauses" is consistently embodied through her choice to abandon glass-making for observation, then decisively return to the kiln with transformed intent. Internal contradiction appears when she both fears fire and uses it to seal her final piece, with the shift earned by the frost-cipher discovery. The ledger's violence→frost's serenity arc constrains her final choice to create rather than report, forecloses revenge with visible cost. Minor: the "steadily adaptive" trait is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and filtered through her thermal-vision frame; the violet–orange–indigo sequence embodies contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final decision to weave fear into sunrise rather than erase it demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (exhaustion → peace). Minor slip: "all-consuming" motivation label early borders on generic, but the heat-mapping particulars recover specificity. The capsize intrusion and its transformation are dramatized rather than summarized, supporting the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation (ending the psychic noise) is concrete and drives his choice to descend. The weariness is embodied ("etched deeper than the lines on his face"), and the trait "inadvertently stubborn" appears as a label without on-page friction or cost. The final beat delivers relief but no visible renunciation or trade-off that would elevate the arc; the resolution reads as pure gain. Internal contradiction is absent—he never wavers or doubts—limiting dramatic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices (organizing runs, bringing the bell to elders, declaring the promise at the arbor). Internal contradiction appears when "hunger outvoted suspicion" and her shift from feeding to bridge-building feels earned. The character exhibits credible leadership without safety-hedging, though the emotional progression at the arbor declaration could carry more visceral cost. Secondary characters (elders, youths) apply pressure relevant to the intergenerational stake.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's spiritual curiosity is established and her quest shows internal coherence, but the character's arc from ache to eased resonance lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The "phantom limb" grief is told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final shift reads as received wisdom rather than hard-won through on-page struggle with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract label-speak ("foggy lucidity," "painful clarity") without grounding in contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and his internal contradiction—ambition driving him into memory dissolution—operates throughout. The final erasure is earned by prior causality with visible cost: he loses all identity to sever the fragment's hold. Interiority remains specific ("sandpaper, grinding him down to dust"), though the peak choice feels slightly externalized by the maze's geometry rather than a final interior micro-decision. Embodied emotion is strong ("frantic heartbeat," "trembling leaves"), and the protagonist's flawed obsession compounds inevitably.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interior is rendered with specificity—her patient strategic mind, the decade-long constraint, the embodied calm. The final choice to activate the defense system is motivated by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost (she remains chained while allies escape). Minor slip: the interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("profound stillness of a patiently strategic mind") rather than embodied contradiction, and the predecessor's role is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to capture trust-breaking registers clearly, and his synesthesia provides distinct perceptual texture. The climactic choice to use the crystal as a hearing aid lands with embodied cost—he hears "the perfect, unassailable silence that now existed where that sound used to be"—showing earned renunciation. However, interior work leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("jagged shard of violet-grey," "acoustically sealed jars") without micro-choices that complicate his single-minded pursuit; the forge sequence proceeds without on-page friction or doubt that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is motivated by a distinct desire (captured life, destiny's tumblers) and his shift from sun-lit portraits to moonbeams constitutes a clear change in stance with embodied reactions ("chill traced its way up his spine"). The interiority leans toward elevated metaphor ("luminous disbelief," "quiet custodian of possibilities") that occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment into abstract labeling. His final realization—"no longer a thief of memories but the quiet custodian of possibilities"—edges toward label-speak but is saved by the jar's on-page presence and his concrete gesture of placing it on the desk. Minor penalty for diction drift in peak beats; otherwise strong motivation and earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's theatrical narration provides a distinct coping mechanism, and the bookmark memory liquefies her frozen grief with embodied precision. However, the glassblowing motivation ("safe zones for inquiry") remains abstract and unexplored through concrete choices—what questions, for whom, and why here? The final abandonment feels situationally forced rather than earned by internal contradiction; her heart "thaws" in the final paragraph via summary rather than through on-page micro-choices that test competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's interior voice is concrete and embodied—"familiar spike of acrophobia making my stomach lurch," "claustrophobia a hot pulse in my throat"—grounding fear in sensation. The motivation shift from survival to proving vulnerability as power is ambitious but becomes label-speak in the final beats: "trembling with a certainty that felt like an earthquake in my soul" reads declarative rather than earned through micro-choices. The adaptiveness trait is stated but never genuinely constrained; Leo solves every puzzle without visible struggle or tradeoff. Julian's entrance deflates immediately into a foil rather than a live threat, and the protagonist's perfect recall of constellation ciphers under peak stress strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—his "cartographer's dream turned metaphysical nightmare" drives him to chart darkness by summarizing silence. The interiority is somewhat abstract ("a mild obsession hummed just beneath his skin") but remains character-particular through his watchmaker-like precision. His task is dramatized through concrete action (tracing the gold leaf), though the internal conflict is muted; he experiences no genuine struggle or contradictory impulse during the ritual, only patient execution. The ending shows completion rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost, landing closer to task fulfillment than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit 734's motivation is concrete and evolves clearly across 8,192 loops from escape-seeking to understanding-seeking to a specific act of amalgamation. The final thought—"The G-string sounds a little flat tonight"—delivers embodied interiority through a ghost memory rather than the robot's own experience, which cleverly earns the premise that thoughts come from "the ghosts we carry." Internal contradiction is present (analytical machine pursuing the origin of thought) and drives the climax choice to interface with the violin despite catastrophic error warnings. The protagonist's arc from composed repetition to risk-taking synthesis feels motivated, though the embodied stakes remain cerebral rather than visceral throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "thaw the frost of their shared mistrust" is clear and drives his eavesdropping decision, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract constructions ("the dense, ringing silence," "fortress of quiet") that tell emotional state rather than embody it through contradictory micro-choices. The climactic gesture—offering the lens box—reads as symbolic rather than rooted in a visible hierarchy of values with cost. Lena remains a cipher whose grief is asserted through doodles but never dramatized in contradictory action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and concrete—garden knowledge versus data—and his actions track consistently through memory, ritual, and pragmatic choices. The marble ritual provides embodied interiority, though his internal conflict between pride and pragmatism could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure moments. The final choice to crack the pristine marble is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor deduction: the manager remains largely a cardboard antagonist with no real complexity or adaptive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is well-drawn with concrete physicality (hydraulic-stained hands, scars) and a consistent professional temperament. His interior life is mostly embodied through perception and micro-choices, though the climactic vertigo moment edges toward abstract epiphany ("infinite, sprawling map"). The emotional progression from obliging mechanic to profoundly re-calibrated observer is earned by the on-page event. Aris functions primarily as motivational pressure rather than a full secondary character, but his trembling hands and tears provide embodied contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to decode the ghost's message is clear and drives his choices throughout. His decision to disrupt the water surface represents a meaningful turn under pressure. However, the interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("heart hammering," "strange creative fever") and the final emotional state resolves too cleanly without residual cost or contradiction. The character remains more archetype than individual, lacking embodied contradictions that would elevate the work.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied—grief as "an indigestible stone," her "wide, soft net" of awareness. The final choice to leave the word unresolved feels earned by her need for ambiguity, establishing a clear internal contradiction that acts in scene. Minor deduction: the "fault-tolerant oracle" framing risks label-speak, though it's integrated enough to survive; "auroral sorrow" borders on over-articulated emotional state but remains grounded in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's recklessness, sleep-deprived state, and emotional paralysis around "I did nothing" create a coherent interior landscape. The silent kinship with the radio caller and the physical act of turning the valve earn the final realization that he can carry his weight. Minor slip: the "religiously skeptical" trait is asserted but never tested on-page with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong throughout—rust smell, frigid metal, ragged breathing—anchoring abstract guilt in sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is richly embodied through sensory detail (moss-cushioned flagstones, papyrus decay) and the weight of absorbed memories manifests physically. Internal contradiction appears in the keeper's dual role—witnessing without judgment while being unmanned by what is witnessed—but the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure. The journey to the refuge feels like a coping mechanism rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the keeper knows they will return, which softens the stakes. Embodied emotion is strong but the arc reads more as temporary respite than transformation or endurance with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his therapeutic approach shapes his choices, but his interiority reads label-heavy ("cautious exuberance," "nurturing wonder") rather than embodied contradiction. Lena's grief is particularized through the curl and her physical rigidity, and her final shift—from desperate grip to tender hold—feels earned by the eclipse experience. The therapy-speak framing ("softly adaptive," "beneath the hush of dreaming roots") distances the reader from immediate emotional stakes. Minor: "sixty years" of sorrow feels stated rather than dramatized in her body and micro-choices until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his "sensitively perceptive" nature is embodied through his tactile engagement with the diaries. His internal state—the "profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze"—feels earned by the discovery. However, the piece leans heavily on contemplation; Kaelen makes no micro-choices under pressure, only receives information, which limits the sense of internal contradiction or agency-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established through reflection rather than tested on-page choices under pressure. His "accidentally prophetic" gift is asserted but never shown creating a dilemma or cost during the exchange itself. The final decision to leave reads as declaration ("ready to listen to a different song") rather than emerging from contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Interior voice relies on elevated, abstract phrasing ("cryptic fortune cookie writer," "conspiracy of goodwill") that sits outside urgent embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Alistair's interiority is concrete and purposeful—his use of silence, the loop pedal, and rhetorical probing all flow from a coherent philosophical stance. Elara's possession is rendered through embodied detail (white knuckles, shuddering body) rather than stock labels. The entity's limitation to monochrome philosophy drives the climax credibly, though its defeat feels slightly too swift given the depth of its axiom. Minor: the entity's voice ("dry rustle") leans toward generic possession tropes without full specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interior life is densely rendered through embodied detail (the nautilus segment warming in his palm, exhaustion as "lead weight"), and his motivation drives the night's work. However, the character operates in near-total isolation—no on-page dialogue or relationship pressure to test contradictory impulses. The final shift from "painful lament to a single, sustained, foundational note" feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult choice that forecloses a visible path. The mystical framing (reverse-engineering a soul, tuning symphonies of causality) leans toward abstraction at peak moments, reducing the specificity of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority shows promising contradiction—fighting vs. accepting the painful memory—and the final choice to open himself to the source trauma is earned by cycles of failure. However, the embodiment remains thin: "let the pain wash over him" tells rather than shows the felt cost, and the emotional progression from resistance to acceptance happens too cleanly without messy intermediate states. The gravity-defier trait functions more as metaphor than as a character-specific flaw that complicates choices. Therapy-speak like "conquer the labyrinth of self" in peak beats reduces specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (defeating numbness) is clearly established and her physicalized relationship with sound shows character-specific perception. However, the audience members remain entirely passive receptors—their weeping and smiling feel like effects rather than choices, and we see no internal contradiction or struggle in Elara herself during the performance beat. The final moment rests on assertion ("The numbness had not been defeated") rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's professional lens (reading weather data) is embodied and specific, driving his choice to pursue the subterranean route. His need for "integrity of his solitude" shapes the lateral approach over confrontation. Interior contradiction appears when he recognizes the pattern "felt familiar...as a path to be followed"—curiosity warring with self-preservation—though this could deepen further under stress. The final walk inside with instruments carries visible cost (abandoning safety) but the renunciation of tranquility as refuge feels slightly told rather than enacted in a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates a consistent worldview (pattern-seeking poet navigating impossible choices), and his prison-rope memory anchors an earned refusal. The "ethically playful" trait appears mostly as stated cleverness rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. His final stance feels more articulated than struggled-toward—the wry smile and declaration read cerebral rather than embodied with visible cost in the moment. The interior voice remains coherent but leans toward philosophical exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her ritual with the bowl and her choice to play despite knowing she cannot shatter the hush. The grandfather's memory provides clear internal contradiction—longing for the old world versus acceptance of the new—that drives her final action. The progression from passive listening to active music-making shows earned change with visible cost (physical exhaustion, emotional fullness). Minor weakness: the "acoustically perceptive" trait is more label than dramatized constraint affecting specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception: "the air crackled," "cold and heavy weight that clung like damp silk," and the final cost—absorbing sorrow as "residue in his own soul"—is concretely felt. His motivation is contradictory and complex: the obsessive need to "fuse insight with empathy" forces him to subsume the entire emotion, knowing he will pay a personal price. The emotional arc from clinical detachment through immersion to "tender, affectionate detachment" reads as earned progression. Minor slip: the phrase "quiet, obsessive need" leans slightly toward telling, though the surrounding embodiment anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is coherent and his attentive nature shows in micro-choices (the envelope response, the grant research). However, his interiority remains surface-level—calculations are asserted ("shrewd mind having calculated this emotional risk") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Alina is more gestural than inhabited; her nervous locket habit and tearful gratitude read as stock emotional responses without embodied complexity. The transformation feels delivered to her rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's loneliness and need for belonging are embodied through his reed-weaving and observation of overlooked spaces. His shift from passive longing to active participation (standing up, joining the search, offering his mats) shows growth, though the final acceptance feels slightly convenient—Lyra's polishing-cloth gesture lands as symbolic validation rather than a choice with visible internal friction. The "luminescent ache" transforms into "steady glow of belonging" through on-page actions, but the resolution tilts toward wish-fulfillment: he receives exactly what he sought without meaningful renunciation or cost beyond his initial shyness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is abstract and articulated in label-speak ("his life's ambition was to find the place where echoes are born"), weakening early interiority. His pivot to action—following the Chronovore and using the pendant—shows embodied problem-solving under pressure. The final realization ("the echo's birthplace was the brief, terrifying silence of an interrupted cadence") tips toward articulated wisdom rather than earned through micro-choices, though the on-page sequence of observing, following, and acting demonstrates agency. Interior contradiction is minimal; he moves from observer to restorer with clear stakes but limited flaws or blind spots that complicate the path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his grief-work, with embodied emotion in the channeling sequence ("pushed the feeling of the empty space beside him in bed"). Internal contradiction shows in his stated goal ("not to find her, but to quantify the void") versus the underlying hope that surfaces at the end. The final renunciation—accepting the loss has shape rather than seeking erasure—is earned by the ritual's success. Minor slip: the "buried optimism finally breaking the surface like a seedling" edges toward label-speak at a peak beat but the image anchors it enough to avoid therapy-tone.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to become visible to those who need you") is legible and embodied in his methodical work and the final placement of the tape. His particular sensitivity creates a concrete capability. However, Anya remains more sketch than person—her grief is told ("mask of grief and academic ruin") rather than shown through micro-choices, and Elias's interior relies on somewhat generic phrasing ("quiet click of satisfaction"). The change at closure (he has "been found") reads more as theme fulfillment than costly alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is well-embodied through concrete action (raw knuckles, murmuring to lavender) and his internal conflict between control and surrender drives the arc. The epiphany arrives through observation of the vine's new tendrils rather than abstract contemplation, lending it earned weight. Minor slip: "the truths he couldn't direct at his own reflection" edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, though the circuitously sincere trait mitigates this. The final choice—reaching for saw and pry bar rather than hammer—demonstrates agency with visible cost (abandoning preservation for transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistently embodied through concrete actions—following rain trails, working the brooch free, choosing story over possession. His wryly earnest self-awareness ("A fool's errand") operates as genuine character texture rather than hedge. The exchange decision crystallizes a hierarchy of values (meaning over material gain) with visible cost in the final shift from landscape to portraiture. Interior contradiction surfaces in the insomnia framing: predator versus companion, a shift earned by the story's event.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's arc from fearful guardian to one who understands her obsolescence is earned through concrete beats: her visions failing, her hand lowering at the threshold, her final peace. Internal contradiction shows when she feels protectiveness while simultaneously questioning her role. The shadow-merger moment that restores her clairvoyance only to reveal present truth is a strong embodied choice. Kael remains somewhat thin—his humility is asserted more than tested—but his function as catalyst works within the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (excavating, cataloging, listening). His "reactively visionary" trait provides internal texture and shapes his approach to fragments. The woman's response to the valve demonstrates earned emotional progression with embodied grief ("breath caught," "trembling finger"). Minor weakness: Kaelen's arc is more about purpose-reaffirmation than transformation, though the woman's shift provides the story's emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (find the fortress to understand the mentor's fate) is clear and drives him forward, but his internal life remains thinly sketched. The "trembling certainty" recurs as a label rather than embodied contradiction—he never hesitates or second-guesses on the page. The final acceptance of guardianship arrives without visible struggle or cost; he simply understands and feels "profound calm," which reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interior progression from "bedrock facts" skeptic to one who accepts connection through grief is embodied and earned through concrete micro-choices—handling the tile, transcribing, resisting the impulse to hurl it, then engaging courageously with the data. His contradiction between honoring a dying wish and dismissing "fanciful" beliefs drives visible tension. The final acceptance reads as a stance crystallization rather than an epiphany drop, though the "courageously kind" descriptor feels slightly externalized rather than enacted with visible cost in that exact moment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Xylos's motivation is clear and earned by eons of existence, and the final choice to step through the rift is dramatized with visible cost ("embracing" the curse's energy, leaving the sanctuary). However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("star-crushing boredom," "the weary chain of cause and effect") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist's internal conflict between the curse's pull and his purpose is told more than shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the amulet's "desperate attempt" personifies rather than dramatizes resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and well-embodied through her work rituals and the atonement framework. Her internal contradiction—using her father's most dishonest tool for a "profoundly fair" act—drives the central choice with visible cost. The relationship with her absent father is well-drawn through objects and comparison, though Mr. Silus remains functionally passive cargo rather than a pressure source. Minor slip: "strange clarity this room sometimes afforded her, a place that liquefies rigid thinking" edges toward meta-commentary on the attribute rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—her "earnestly studious" attribute drives her elaborate dawn ritual without therapy-speak. The motivation to "collect the textures of different times" is embodied through physical action (charting, drawing, mixing pulp) rather than abstract musing. Her final "incandescent restraint" reads as genuine earned emotion tied to success at her task. Minor: the piece lacks on-page contradiction or mistake that would test her competence under pressure; her process succeeds smoothly without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete, sensory particulars: collecting fragments, layering emotions, building a "patchwork soul." The poison label anchors a visible micro-choice in the final third—the narrator layers grief and wonder over it, transforms its meaning, then places it back in the tin. Internal contradiction emerges (craving memories while existing as "erasure"), but the single-beat embodied cost and absence of a second live choice during peak pressure hold the score below the 8.0 threshold. No diagnostic label-speak appears, though some diction ("aching violet," "warm gold") skirts abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular—his "quiet theater where he reimagines past conversations" and "gloomy cheerfulness" are specific embodied states. His motivation (decode Thorne's riddle) drives every micro-choice under pressure: adjusting tension, placing shell against wood, interpreting the ephemeral compass result. The final renunciation—accepting a lifelong, private task over public spectacle—forecloses the myth-buster career path with visible cost. Minor slip: the colleague's mocking voice is clean setup but reads slightly convenience-placed rather than arising from present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and his internal conflict between anarchic soul and orderly mind drives key choices. The character carries contradictory impulses that act simultaneously—loving chaos while imposing structure—though the execution skews toward strategic competence with less vulnerability under pressure. His micro-choices (approaching Zola, embedding messages, watching the inspector) advance goals with embodied tension. The foundation stone chip serves as a tactile anchor for his dual allegiance, though the final moment with it reads more meditative than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in his grandfather's legacy, but his choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The internal experience is vivid through embodied detail ("thermal seals," "gloved fingers"), yet the protagonist never faces a genuine dilemma—he executes a plan without meaningful internal contradiction or cost. The melancholy is asserted more than earned through on-page struggle; he photographs the bloom and leaves, with no visible forfeit that tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific—to decode feedback into direction—and her blind artisan identity shapes her choices throughout. The method of using water basins to "see" is character-particular and credible. The final choice to complete the repair under pressure embodies her values, though the cost remains implicit rather than deeply felt; we see competence more than genuine struggle. Internal contradiction is limited; she remains magnetically calm throughout without meaningful vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established and his professional expertise is well-drawn ("subtly confident hum of a man who trusts the map"). His transition from skepticism to professional focus is earned through the accumulating clues, though the final transformation into "sole archivist" feels slightly declared rather than fully embodied. Internal contradiction is present in his adherence to rationalism while pursuing a "mad motivation," and his micro-choices (turning off the lamp, grabbing the spectrograph) are goal-driven and reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established through consistent traits (patience, focus, cryptic purpose) and embodied action (walking patterns, listening to hums). However, his interior remains largely opaque—no contradictory impulses surface, no micro-choices reflect competing values, and the work proceeds without visible struggle or cost to his person. The motivation "to restore shared balance" is asserted but never dramatized as a want conflicting with a fear or need, leaving the character functional but one-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained—to capture the "gathered hush"—with embodied struggle when the psychic maelstrom nearly overwhelms him. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between instinctive flight and mission-driven will, culminating in a choice (isolating the priestess's peace) that forecloses survival with visible cost. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("primal scream," "profound peace") rather than consistently particular embodiment, and the final acceptance reads slightly neat given the extremity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and internally complex—pursuing truth to counter his father's legacy—and drives choices throughout. The memory of suspended bodies creates a vivid discovery, and the decision to break the seal carries visible cost: he will be disbelieved, repeating his father's fate. Minor weakness: the abstract frame ("thread this labyrinth with your own story") occasionally tips into self-aware narration that dilutes immediacy. The earned stasis (accepting permanent doubt) forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's interiority relies heavily on received memory rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "memories that were not his own bled into his thoughts" structure tells us about internal conflict rather than showing it through simultaneous competing desires in a present choice. The final recognition of Lyra and acceptance of the legacy feels more like passive receipt than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but often abstracted through phrases like "heart-stopping mirage" and "mournful elation" rather than specific physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain limited. The sleepwalking premise creates an interesting split between unconscious artistry and conscious intervention, though the transition feels more plot-convenient than psychologically earned. The final storm sequence shows agency under pressure, but the character's internal experience during the climactic sewing remains somewhat externalized. Micro-choices are present but could carry more visible cost and hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through her need to restore faith in lineage. The ship carving discovery triggers a genuine shift—from viewing her great-grandmother's death as interruption to recognizing perpetual courage—that feels earned by prior wandering and observation. Minor slip: the final paragraph's "peaceful acceptance of the questions" edges toward therapeutic phrasing, though it's anchored by the physical tomb-repair act. Embodied contradiction is present (hollowness versus cautious enchantment) but could deepen further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is filtered through concrete gestures—the clipboard, the chalk, the envelope—but his motivation remains largely abstract ("discover meaning in the margins"). The micro-choices (kneeling, drawing, sealing) reflect his professional precision yet lack contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The embodied emotion is present in "the faint taste of adhesive on his tongue" but the arc feels more like execution of a plan than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No on-page secondary character to test his stance under relational pressure.

    Elara's interior life is well-rendered through concrete sensory anchors (needle, flame, silk) and her method of intuitive pattern-reading feels character-specific. Her disguise as "foolish old woman" operates consistently to enable her espionage, and the final choice to transmit the data demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the motivation remains somewhat abstract—"listening for unheard stories" is told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is limited; she moves smoothly from suspicion to decisive action without visible friction or cost that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her exhaustion embodied through "skin around her eyes bruised with shadow." Kael's desperation is shown through "quiet desperation" and his weeping, though his internal conflict remains thin—he's a receiver more than an agent. The gargoyle shard functions as both anchor and tool, grounding her process. The moonlight-healing attribute is mentioned but doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost, remaining label-only.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through embodied micro-choices: worrying the coral, leaning in to decrypt symbols, strategic gentleness with both child and General. His motivation to bridge divides is enacted through concrete action rather than summary. The General's flicker from commander to father arrives quickly but is earned by the coral-mirror of his own unspoken anxieties. Minor: Elias's "shrewdly innocent" trait is asserted more than dramatized in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is embodied through sensory particulars (cool fresco fragment, empty hands, chest ache) and contradictory impulses—desperation versus gentle coaxing—act simultaneously in the painting sequence. The memory of the other figure emerges with cost: "a face he hadn't allowed himself to fully remember for years." The final shift from boisterous glee to "gentle, bittersweet warmth" is earned by the prior struggle, and the smile is "tempered with the soft sorrow of its passing"—a credible endurance with visible emotional cost. Minor: the interiority occasionally edges toward summary ("the joy remained elusive, a phantom limb") rather than fully embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior is embodied through methodical observation and playful experimentation across nested layers. The shift from "dull desire to return" to active curiosity is earned through repeated micro-choices in the garden sequences. The final smile and choice of "something that rings" demonstrates a credible transformation with visible cost (trading certainty for curiosity). Minor deduction for the apprentice functioning primarily as a frame device rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is established early and his charming facade dropping to "raw steel beneath" shows internal contradiction. However, his final choice feels insufficiently earned—the plan to use the seed/orchid appears suddenly without prior wrestling with the moral calculus of "wiping a dozen city blocks of consciousness." Aris is functional opposition but remains a sounding board. The "feverish intensity" and "unguarded smile" at closure read as performed emotion rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is richly textured—"to photosynthesize pain into beauty" embodies her drive—and the shift from longing to acceptance is tracked through concrete choices (retrieving the postcard, placing it in moonlight). However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting *in scene*; the transformation is told through metaphor ("sand grinding into a pearl") rather than dramatized through a visible mistake or friction that costs her something immediate. The final placement of the postcard is a renunciation, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation to preserve extinct emotions is clear and shapes his actions, but his internal experience remains abstract—we see what he does (dusting, humming) without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The ritual feels observed rather than felt; his "crushing emptiness" and "foxglove regret" are label-only emotions that don't manifest as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending choice (lighting the orchid) is structurally present but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; he simply continues his "endless, gentle patrol" unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's interior is well-developed with contradictory impulses ("carefully reckless," fear of inadequacy versus desperate love) that drive the final choice. The embodied emotion is strong—"breath held tight," "frantic beating of his heart"—though some therapy-adjacent phrasing appears ("bone-deep agony of knowing he had hurt her"). Elara's entrance at the end demonstrates earned shift from "guarded pain" to tentative hope, grounded in what she perceives. Minor weakness: the "reckless precision" trait feels more asserted than demonstrated through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to decode his father's silence is established early and drives discovery choices. The father's characterization through letters shows contradictory impulses (love enacted through distance), though the discovery lands as summary rather than contradictory action in scene. Embodiment is thin—"pressure built within him" leans toward stock phrasing—and the final epiphany ("Duty and love...two parts of the same complex, vital machine") edges into over-articulated insight without sufficient struggle on the page. The protagonist's choices (following chain, finding cavity) feel more like puzzle-solving than value collision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation (preserving Lena's music) is coherent and embodied through the pigeon ritual, and his reinvention habit creates internal contradiction. The storm forces a meaningful choice that narrows options with visible cost. However, the final beat—handing Anna the pigeon with a scroll bearing a written phrase rather than music—feels weakly motivated; the shift from guarding song fragments to sharing a written sentiment lacks the earned causality of a decision rooted in prior pressure. The emotional turn toward trust is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear and evolves meaningfully—from wanting home to needing to understand sacred thresholds. His micro-choices (tracing grain, cross-referencing the logbook, choosing to step through) are embodied and escalate under pressure. The interiority is concrete and particular ("featherly determined" is a fresh, character-specific frame), and the final choice to analyze grain on the new platform shows credible transformation with visible cost: he accepts permanent separation. Minor slip: the phrase "featherly determined" appears once as telling rather than being fully dramatized through contradiction or struggle in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation to find belonging is consistently rendered through embodied choices (the feather in pocket, dimming lights, mapping energy). Elara's arc from skepticism to tears feels slightly rushed but her professional curtness is maintained throughout. Internal contradiction appears when Kaelen clutches the feather with trembling hands yet speaks calmly—a genuine tension. The final realization about belonging feels somewhat articulated rather than purely dramatized, though it follows from the shared moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's professional curiosity drives the recollection work with clear motivation, and the final realization that the traveler chose transformation shows earned understanding. The interiority remains consistent—methodical, cheerful, puzzle-solving—with embodied actions (sprinkling seeds, pressing glass) that advance pressure. However, the emotional arc feels too smooth: Kael moves from curiosity to "genuinely happy" without significant internal friction or contradiction. The stakes remain intellectual throughout; no personal cost or foreclosed path emerges from the discovery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is coherent—serenading monotony with orchestrated chance—and his analytical observation drives the setup. However, the piece withholds a crucial limitation: no on-page friction tests his capability or forces a visible cost at closure. The arguing couple's shift reads as externally prompted wonder rather than a dramatized internal contradiction in Kael. The bishop's retrieval and internal smile feel like satisfaction without foreclosed alternatives or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interior motivation is clear—to practice forbidden art and create testimony—but his interiority remains at one emotional temperature throughout. The "spontaneously anchored" shift reads more as abstract description than an embodied internal contradiction driving choice. The final transformation ("begin to fledge") is asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a live path with visible cost. No secondary character pressures him, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is concrete and his perceptual signature as a glazier is consistent ("reads between the lines of the world's quiet prose"). The final choice to let the atrium go is earned and embodies renunciation with visible cost. However, the epiphany at the pond arrives too smoothly—"A profound peace settled over him" flattens the contradiction between a decade's work and sudden acceptance, replacing struggle with therapeutic resolution. Internal conflict is told rather than enacted in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies through the story—his need to enlighten Kaelen drives the narrative. The box-handling detail ("ran a thumb over a hairline fissure") and scar-touching show embodied emotion. Internal contradiction is present in "a stupid choice, I know" balanced against "that box was everything." The final choice to close his hands around the box feels earned, though Kaelen remains mostly receptive without significant internal conflict of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trait as "logical dreamer" who treats hope as an equation is established early and her watchfulness drives observation, but her choices remain largely procedural—she sorts materials, places them, observes the gauge. Internal conflict is minimal; she experiences one moment of doubt ("Had she miscalculated so badly?") but it resolves immediately without cost or lasting friction. The final satisfaction ("quiet satisfaction of a problem elegantly solved") reads as competence without vulnerability, and no path is foreclosed with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's profession and perceptual signature are distinct and character-specific. Her choice to return the negative and leave the evidence in the fireplace is clearly motivated by her ethos ("not hers to carry, only to chart") and forecloses the path of exposing the legacy. Minor weakness: the internal contradiction between professional curiosity and ethical restraint could be more viscerally embodied under pressure; the final choice reads deliberate but calm rather than fought-through.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mirage painter's motivation is clear and his "borrowed heartbeat" technique provides concrete grounding, but his interior remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The piece tells us he is "perceptively calm" without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously in the moment. Micro-choices (lifting hands, humming) are present but lack the felt cost or internal friction that would elevate characterization into the high bands. The final satisfied smile reads as summary rather than embodied complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly anchored in anchoring ideals to practice, and his "operatively gentle" method is demonstrated through specific tactics (letting the weight of place settle, tracing the sigil). His micro-choices—selecting dust from the terrace, timing his words to the moons—carry visible cost and shape the generals' responses. However, the generals remain granite masks throughout; their final surrender feels abrupt rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment Kaelen's hand trembles and Vorlag's face "crumbles" arrives without prior micro-choices that would dramatize their internal war.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias Vance's motivation is deeply embodied—the birdsong memory fractures his resolve, his fingers tremble, and his inner contradiction (amoral baron dreaming of song) drives the pilgrimage. The penance-driven arc is consistent and his final act forecloses restoration with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "secretly sentimental" attribute is told more than it constrains on-page choices; the gesture feels inevitable but the internal wrestling could press harder against a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are goal-driven, but her emotional interiority remains abstract—labels like "alarming serenity" and "perfect control" dominate where embodied contradiction would sharpen her under pressure. The judge's final echo as the keystone motivation lands cleanly, but the decade-long harvest is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal how she acquired and carried each burden. Her final smile reads as closure, yet the absence of visible cost or internal friction during the rite flattens what should be a terrifyingly intimate act.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interior is concrete and specific—his calligrapher's precision and urbane manner contrast effectively with the industrial setting. The internal conflict between artistic purity and audience harm is embodied through his tracing of the story stick and the memory of the hollow-eyed man, creating genuine ambivalence. His decision to perform a response piece is earned by the tremor of doubt and Elara's accusation, though the final shift reads slightly too assured given the preceding uncertainty. The micro-choices (retrieving the stick, opening the trunk, deciding to complicate rather than retract) effectively reveal his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is given clear motivation (to honor overlooked histories rather than save) and his work with structures shows embodied competence. His "esoteric realist" role is rendered through concrete action—gathering materials, tying knots with "practiced fingers"—rather than label alone. Internal contradiction is muted; he accepts the extinction with little on-page struggle between hope and realism, which flattens the character arc. The final moment of packing away the moth wing carries quiet fulfillment but minimal visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—the "snowmelt ardor" and "quiet sea of fulfillment" embody his shift from past failure to present purpose. His technically gentle precision and the way his fingers move "with reverent purpose" show character-specific physicality. Internal contradiction is thin; he experiences only positive resolve and fulfillment without visible cost or renunciation at the ending. The final choice to sketch and cast the sigil feels more like an addendum than a foreclosing decision that alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's fractured temporal perception is specific and constraining—he exists only in past/future, not present—and this shapes his final choice to consume the seal. The transformation from gray-smeared non-presence to full embodiment is earned through prior causality. Minor weakness: the dream-state visions feel slightly convenience-plotted rather than emerging from established character logic, but the core arc of starvation forcing transcendence is compelling and costs are visible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kavi is particularized through his frugality, observational rigor, and devotion to celestial math, and his internal contradiction—using empirical method to summon the unknowable—drives the choice to perform the ritual. His final choice to dismantle the diagram and keep the secret forecloses public recognition with visible cost. Minor weakness: his interior remains calm and methodical throughout, with no moment of doubt or competing impulse dramatized under pressure; the empirical irony is declared rather than shown through micro-hesitation or conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Vale and Elara are abstract presences rather than embodied characters; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, only a binary choice at the end. Elara's "pacifist schemer" trait is asserted but never tested by an on-page dilemma that would reveal competing values. Vale's resentment is declared ancient and physical but dramatized only as flickering energy, not as a layered consciousness making micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance reads as a logic gate flipping rather than an earned interior turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is complex and embodied through concrete action—the breathing ritual, the placement of objects. Interior landscape remains character-specific without therapy-speak. The final choice (picking up the sextant after the frost shatters) earns its renunciation with visible cost: she does not achieve permanence but proves the boundary erasable. Minor slip: the father's dream functions more as backdrop than living contradiction that Elara wrestles with in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's arc from rigid traditionalist to adaptive wisdom-seeker is earned through embodied frustration ("coiled in his gut"), the physical rediscovery of the ribbon, and micro-choices that shift his perception of the crystal from wound to germination. The internal contradiction—holding his daughter's stolen ribbon while resenting her departure—acts continuously and resolves through the seed-planting choice. Minor slip: the epiphany moment ("wave of accidental wisdom") edges toward declared insight rather than pure dramatization, though the subsequent action grounds it. Backstory and reflection anchor concretely to the ribbon and crystal, tilting present stance with visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clearly established and drives his inquiry throughout. His interiority shows concrete embodiment ("pressure of the paradoxes...behind his eyes," "braced his hands on the ceramic sink") and his breakthrough arises from sustained engagement with the puzzle. The transition from bewilderment to "terrible clarity" is earned through the bathroom reflection sequence, though the final pivot feels slightly abrupt—the cost of understanding is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. Minor: the curator role and mandate are told rather than shown constraining a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's scholarly passion transforms into urgent mission after Kael's arrival, but the interiority remains largely abstract—"quiet pursuit," "urgent rescue," "weight of futures"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choices (matching catalog gaps, facing Curators) are present but feel more puzzle-solving than deeply conflicted agency. The final confrontation with the Curators shows some internal tension ("frantic beat of her own heart") yet the stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. No clear internal flaw drives inevitable mistakes or complicates the path.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her quest is deeply rooted in her unique biology, but interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("shifting sea," "negative space") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously. The climactic womb memory delivers genuine emotional weight, yet the final stance crystallization feels more articulated than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. The piece skirts therapy-speak with phrases like "blissfully aberrant peace" and "dual consciousness," which come close to diagnostic label-speak without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—translating confusion into clarity—is coherent and drives his choices throughout. His methodical curiosity is embodied in concrete actions (retrieving the seal, weaving the rope). However, internal conflict is minimal; he proceeds with steady confidence rather than contradictory impulses. The resolution feels more like problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, limiting the sense of character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and character-particular; his motivation intensifies cleanly from documenting frequencies to conjuring silence. The ritual sequence shows embodied emotion through physical protest ("old bones protesting") and focused will-building against the sonic assault. The final earned repose feels motivated by the established struggle, though the transformation lacks a visible internal contradiction or renunciation that would elevate it further. Minor slip: the phrase "fortress of will" edges toward abstraction in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and well-embodied through his retrocognitive visions and physical handling of the prism fragments. His motivation—proving coincidences have meaning—drives consistent choices culminating in the final assembly. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat neat: his moment of doubt ("perhaps the silence was the true state of things") resolves too quickly into restored hope without lingering cost or contradiction. Internal conflict operates more as alternating states than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is specific and voice-consistent ("preemptive nostalgia" is embodied rather than labeled), and his final choice to record the ancestors' act rather than unravel it reflects genuine internal conflict. However, the moment of decision lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; he moves from discovery to choice without visible struggle. The emotional arc from "peculiar sorrow" to "profound understanding" reads somewhat linear, missing the irrational self-deception or hypocrisy that would deepen characterization under peak pressure. Cost is present but muted—he foregoes erasure of the fog, yet the renunciation feels contemplative rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior is grounded in concrete ritual ("Potassium nitrate, carbon, a whisper of sulfur") and embodied habit (rhythmic gait, ambient awareness). His shift from listening to the whole fortress to filtering pattern from noise shows an internal contradiction resolved through discovery. However, the epiphany moment ("hope wasn't a thing to be found, but a pattern to be perceived") edges toward summary wisdom rather than fully dramatized contradiction acting in scene, and the emotional stakes remain abstract—discouragement seeps in but no prior choice or micro-decision establishes what he risks by failing tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied through her observational lens—thumb stroking the cicada, watching the snail—and her contemplative mode feels authentic to a naturalist. The transition from hurt to understanding is earned through her tangential processing rather than stated epiphany. Minor deduction: Kael remains a cipher whose anxious waiting is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses, and the final spoken insight borders on articulated wisdom without sufficient dramatic friction in the choice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivations are clear and embodied through physical sensations ("lungs seized," "tremor in his bones"), and his contradictory relationship with confinement—both product and victim—creates genuine tension. The porcelain doll functions effectively as a concrete anchor for his evolving stance, moving from captive symbol to pilgrim. Minor deduction: the phobia origin feels slightly over-explained ("His father's method of protection..."), and the final revelation ("no longer felt like a captive, but a pilgrim") edges toward telling what the image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is clear and enacted through purposeful teaching—pointing out subtle sounds, offering the storm glass—with embodied details like his "fluidly logical instrument" of a mind. The passenger's transformation from white-knuckled anxiety to softened voice is earned through concrete beats. However, interiority leans toward exposition: "His core motivation was simple: to teach silence how to comfort" reads as authorial summary rather than enacted choice under pressure. The woman's arc feels more demonstrated than lived-in, with her fear of silence stated more than physicalized beyond the initial knuckle-white grip.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's agency is present but largely cerebral—her wisdom drives the sonic unlocking and methodical peeling, yet internal contradiction is minimal. The stakes are external and abstract (system purge), so her emotional stakes feel thin; we see competence and determination, but limited vulnerability or cost that challenges her sense of self. The backstory about "brute force" aspirants is efficient setup, but her motivations remain instrumental rather than deeply personal. Micro-choices under pressure are visible (pressing the ruby flake, recalling sonic architecture), but the final act feels like puzzle-solving rather than a values-driven sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly embodied through the ritual action of pressing the ring to her scar, and the internal contradiction between her careful bridge-burning and her present encroachment creates genuine tension. The six-month timeframe and the physical scarring ritual ground her choices in concrete particulars. Liam's reaction—the shift from rage/despair to unlocking breath—feels earned by the scarred-memory linkage. Minor: "tender shadow keeper" arrives late as a label without earlier behavioral grounding, and the therapy-adjacent phrasing "teach the suffocating how to breathe" teeters on the edge of diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interior life is grounded in embodied contradiction—the "virtuously mischievous spark" and "old rage and new hope" operate simultaneously in the climax. Her micro-choices (pulling the bolt, ignoring the phantom recruiters, choosing to stabilize rather than cage) are motivated by prior trauma (OmniVex collapse, viscous Debt) that reappears as pressure in the Promise's temptations. The final steadying of her breath earns the shift from years of instability, though the epiphany risks slight abstraction in "translate pressure into diamonds."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent—searching for ancestral secrets—and her emotional response to the revelation (relief, understanding of her role as "destination") is embodied. However, her interior life leans toward summary and metaphor ("a weighty question in the still air") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic realization arrives as a download of understanding rather than through a series of micro-choices under pressure, reducing the sense of earned struggle. The shift from seeker to found feels more declared than dramatized through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clearly rooted in preserving possibility, and his decision to release the clasp carries visible cost. However, his interior life remains somewhat abstract—the "silent panic of the glass panes" and "murmured allegiance" feel more atmospheric than embodied contradiction. The knight functions largely in observer-custodian mode until the final gesture; micro-choices that reveal competing impulses are scarce. The ending action is earned by setup but interiority lacks the contradictory texture that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's broken-hearted state and grief over Thomas anchor her motivation to find meaning in small kindnesses, and her final choice to honor the hidden message feels earned. The shift from "broken heart" to "tactfully hopeful" shows internal progression through embodied discovery rather than mere declaration. Interiority remains concrete ("her breath hitched with a quiet, professional curiosity") and the archivist's perceptual signature (dust patterns, raking light, acid-free sleeves) stays consistent. Minor slip: Thomas is mentioned once without integration into present stakes, creating a slight motivational gap.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted and embodied—her underestimation becomes her tactical weapon, her resourcefulness is specific (puddle-maps, crowd cover). Internal contradiction appears subtly: she commits to a "line" she knows is already lost, accepting endurance over victory. The final choice to activate the node forecloses passivity with visible cost (exposure, isolation in the booth). Minor: her expertise in archival work and rebellion tactics could show one micro-mistake or near-miss to deepen vulnerability under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy-driven duty, though his interiority leans heavily on abstract "eerie nostalgia" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The embodied detail (breath pluming, stomach clenching) grounds his effort, and the final choice to lower the saxophone after success carries modest cost—another solitary vigil completed. Internal conflict is minimal; he executes his inherited task without visible friction between competing wants. No second character applies pressure, so relationship/status bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in prophecy-driven purpose; his interiority shows genuine wonder ("his breath caught in his throat") and specific sensory detail ("stained with soil and chlorophyll"). The transformation at closure—"no longer just an orderly sorter"—is legible but arrives through an external trigger (the prod) rather than internal contradiction under pressure. His characterization remains somewhat one-note: reverent, precise, patient throughout, without embodied conflict that tests competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's philosophy and search are motivated consistently, with embodied moments like "his heart beat with the slow, heavy rhythm of a grandfather clock." The final renunciation—accepting the unplannable as "enough"—is earned by the journey. However, the interiority leans toward abstraction ("uncertainly certain," "the question") and the peak realization arrives as tell rather than a conflicted micro-choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is implied but not acted simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and embodied through the alchemical ritual, with clear internal contradiction between grief and memory. The progression from "hollow weight" to "luminous regret" is earned through the transmutation process, though the final insight ("not a burden...but a light") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than pure dramatization. Interiority remains character-particular throughout, avoiding therapy-speak even in peak emotional moments. The balance between devastation and joy during the ritual demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his spiritual-midwife role is embodied through concrete action (pressing the tooth to his temple, filtering the spirit's anguish). The spirit's backstory is delivered efficiently and her sorrow is specific—music left unfinished—but the resolution pivots too cleanly on a single prompted memory without sustained internal contradiction. The crocodile's tooth functions as an anchor, yet Silas himself never faces a meaningful trade-off or misstep; his competence remains untroubled, flattening the struggle required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's proprioceptive enhancement is embodied consistently and his motivation to "discover the mathematics of mercy" drives the final choice to understand rather than escape. Internal contradiction is present (feeling "utterly lost" yet "more grounded than ever"), and the trauma-response memory mechanism creates embodied interiority. However, the peak realization—"They hadn't been trying to break him; they were trying to solve him"—arrives as exposition rather than through a dramatized micro-choice that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring overlooked histories—but interiority leans abstract ("between-worlds translator," "essence") without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure. The lens fragment anchors choice at the market and canvas, yet the final "unfastening" moment lacks visceral struggle; the action feels more willed than earned through competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (approaching the tent, holding the lens) but the climactic beat summarizes internal effort rather than dramatizing contradictory pulls. No embodied emotion or genuine flaws complicate the peak decision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's motivation is concrete and embodied through his "weightless burden" and consistent upward gaze. The internal conflict between noting the anomaly and engaging is brief but genuine, with the ghost's anxiety providing external pressure. The choice to ascend the ladder and the tactile moment with the mainspring barrel demonstrate decision under pressure with visible cost (time, effort, spiritual engagement). Minor slip: the vision-flood feels slightly convenient as an information delivery mechanism rather than earned through Leo's own perception.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Operator remains largely opaque throughout; motivation is stated ("compress eternity into a moment") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The character moves through a series of actions without visible internal conflict or embodied emotion—uncorking, tracing, watching—yet we never see a moment where doubt, cost, or fear enters the calculus. The final stance ("their task complete") reads as declaration rather than earned endurance, and the transformation lacks a visible price that forecloses a path. Interiority is abstract and label-driven rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interior life is vivid and contradictory—"defunct revolutionary" fighting "hushed archives and dusty debating halls" with embodied sorrow ("burnished") anchors characterization. The micro-choice to expose only the shard during the storm reflects his hierarchy of values, and the final smile ("sad, determined") lands contradictory impulses without resolution. Motivation escalates cleanly from academic dispute to existential restitution, earning the shift from defeated to rekindled. Minor: the woman's hands and old man's weeping in the shard feel slightly distant from Kaelen's present agency; the vision informs but does not force a renunciation or visible tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his final choice to embrace humble truth over grandiose heroism is earned by the rust-voice's attack on his self-doubt. However, the internal contradiction feels more toggled than simultaneous—he falters, then corrects—rather than two impulses acting at once in the peak beat. The embodied emotion ("doubt, cold and sharp") works, but the voice's philosophical dialogue borders on thesis-delivery rather than organic interiority under stress. The trait "wilts near dishonesty" constrains the climactic action effectively, raising the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific ("cataloged the world by its rains"), driven by a consistent pull toward the liminal. Her choice to leave the compass behind is earned by the psychometry vision and her evolving understanding of purpose. The motivation shifts from capture to understanding without convenient epiphany; the progression is embodied in her kneeling at the lagoon and her final walk out carrying "nothing but the resonant hush within her." Minor: the lost expedition member's awe is filtered through her psychometry but remains slightly abstract ("stripping away the unnecessary").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her progression from artist to custodian is earned through discovery and action. The physicality of her work—"Heaving water-logged timbers and rolling smaller boulders"—grounds her transformation. Minor slip: the phrase "perpetually learning" and "her understanding deepened through layered meanings" edges toward abstract summary rather than embodied realization. The climactic choice to replicate the pattern feels motivated by the slide's revelation, though the internal contradiction between panic and sudden clarity could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal drive is clear and consistent, but her motivation remains abstract throughout. The revelation at the cathedral feels handed to her rather than earned through difficult choices—she observes and deduces without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The great-grandmother portrait provides emotional resonance, yet Elara's arc lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied struggle that would elevate characterization into the high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear—uncover Elara's truth—and his retrocognition creates consistent interior pressure. The shift from interrogative debris arrangements to a statement of consequence shows character growth under sustained tension. However, the phantom antagonist remains opaque; its gesture of acknowledgment arrives without establishing what internal contradiction or value hierarchy it represents, leaving the relational crucible underdeveloped. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophical registers ("searing reverie," "locus of her final, unresolved tension") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interiority shows concrete motivation (refusing "empty buildings or hollow phantoms") and his alchemical process is embodied through sensory detail ("scent of scorched sugar," "rough texture of a fisherman's net"). However, the character operates in isolation throughout; no relationship pressure tests his resolve, and the ending offers restatement of his initial commitment rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. The strain is described ("profound exhaustion of a god") but emotional embodiment under this specific pressure remains generic—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and his motivations clear: the shift from archiving emotion to needing to starve it creates genuine internal conflict. The museum memory anchors his method with specific sensory detail (cold iron tongue, phantom resonance). His final realization—that his sworn purpose has doomed the city—drives a credible pivot with visible cost. Minor slip: the leap from hearing the prophecy to understanding the full implication ("turned his city into a brightly lit banquet") compresses insight slightly, but the contradiction between oath and survival lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—to understand rather than possess—is clearly stated, and her decision to use the acorn cap to restore order is visible. However, the execution feels more meditative than embodied; the "furiously tranquil" state and the gathering of "loose threads of spacetime" operate at such a high register of abstraction that micro-choices under pressure remain opaque. The final realization about borrowed time reads as an awarded epiphany rather than one earned through contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict is present as a declared state but not dramatized as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation (favoring listening over noise) is established early and drives his final choice with clear stakes. His "credibly curious" trait manifests through months of pattern-tracing that shapes the climax. The internal conflict is embodied through action rather than label-speak, and the final choice forecloses the institutional path with visible cost. Minor slip: the backstory about finding the rope and his months of tracking occupies substantial space without enough present-scene micro-choices to fully anchor it, though it does prime the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interior life is specific and embodied—his spiritual curiosity manifests in ritual action with the yellow glass, not label-only introspection. The empathic connection with the falling star demonstrates contradictory impulses (fear of vulnerability vs. yearning for meaning) acting simultaneously on the page. The final realization that "dust was simply the memory of light" is earned through the visceral experience rather than declared, and his stance shift—from detached observer to participant—carries visible cost in the transformation of his self-conception. Minor slip: the phrase "spiritually curious, a quiet seeker" edges toward summary, though action quickly grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-specific: his silence as a "tomb for everything he failed to say" and the belief that containment gave words "sacred gravity" reveal contradictory impulses that drive the closure choice. The decision to open the box is earned by accumulated pressure—Lyra's desperate focus, the swirling ghosts—and forecloses his decade-long strategy with visible cost. Minor weaknesses: the phrase "his decades of solitude falling away" edges toward summary; "she was part of him, and she could finally hear" risks slight over-articulation of the epiphany. Embodied emotion is strong ("his fingers, clumsy from disuse"), and the final stance crystallization reads as genuine endurance rather than neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is consistently textured through his obsession with the urn fragment and his tactile engagement with objects. The motivation is embodied in concrete actions—holding the fragment for hours, devising the garage sale—though the final "feeling" of the memory relies heavily on telling rather than micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (his borrowed time versus the fragment's timelessness) but the closure renunciation ("gnawing sense... had vanished") reads as too cleanly resolved without visible cost or a dramatized final choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interior texture is vivid and consistent—"warmly attentive," seeking beauty in fragments—but his response to the child's distress is purely observational. The choice to walk away and gather a feather rather than comfort feels motivated by character, yet no competing impulse (help vs. observe) is dramatized in the moment. Embodied emotion is strong in the opening, but the pivotal beat lacks the contradiction or micro-choice under pressure that would lift this into high bands. The final act of "weaving" remains abstract; no visible cost or foreclosed path materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation (fostering interspecies respect) is concrete and drives his systematic wrapping of copper wire around trees. His embodied calm under terminal diagnosis is shown through action—"a steady hand," "unhurried precision"—rather than stated. Internal contradiction is minimal; his resolve solidifies linearly without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment of peace against the pillar earns the closure, but the lack of on-page friction or mistake that complicates his project before success keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris demonstrates clear interiority with embodied skepticism (worrying the amber, tracking his own "disappointingly unscientific" anticipation). His transformation is earned through concrete perception rather than declaration—the shift from isolation to "expanded" reads as genuine contradictory impulse dramatized in scene. The final gesture of placing the amber carries visible cost (sacrificing "cherished skepticism") and forecloses his former stance. Minor slip: the "chemistry of homecoming" frame occasionally tilts toward academic register rather than lived thought, though it remains largely character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical work—kneeling, fertilizing, pressing seeds—with micro-choices visible on the page. His "quiet atonement" and belief in "submerged concord" drive consistent action without self-conscious introspection. The piece lacks internal contradiction or visible struggle; his resolve faces no meaningful friction, only the birds' minor navigation guidance. The ending crystallizes his stance (return tomorrow) with visible cost (aching back, lighter satchel), though the cost is gentle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her interaction with the cylinder and leaf, creating purposeful micro-choices under pressure. Barrow functions well as a secondary pressure point whose senses enable rather than decide. The journey and discovery feel earned by prior setup, though the final epiphany ("not about finding what was lost, but about nurturing what was left") edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. Internal contradiction is present in Elara's mix of hope and despair, grounding the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment she "catches a glimpse" and then "finally understood her blessing" reads as a label-only epiphany without prior micro-choices that earn it. Interiority leans abstract ("temporally stretched, like an old recording played at the wrong speed") rather than embodied. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost—she moves from isolated confusion to readiness without forfeiting a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation ("embrace the unknown with open arms") drives the climb and swap with clear embodiment: bare hands gripping ice, smiling at howling wind. The swap itself shows character-specific finesse and audacity. Internal contradiction is present but muted—the "cautious abandon" oxymoron is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment ("soul was lighter") veers toward label-only satisfaction rather than earned change with visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's arc from crisis actor to witness-historian shows purposeful interiority with contradictory impulses: her "feigned sorrows tasted like ash" versus her final raw grief performance. Her micro-choices—pacing coded letters, stopping before the chessboard—escalate under pressure and culminate in the tears that crack the Regent's composure. The Regent's "benevolently ruthless" trait is embodied through surgical amputation metaphors and the tremor of doubt at the knight's flank, though her turn at the end feels slightly telescoped. Elara's final embodied grief forecloses her safe observer role with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—"the thunder in her chest" recurs with earned physical weight, and her nightly phantom-world substitutions show internal conflict through enacted evasion rather than summary. The final choice to plant herbs and clear paths demonstrates embodied renunciation of escape with visible cost (forgoing the phantom worlds). Minor slip: the phrase "her buried talents unfurled not as a violent flood, but as the quiet opening of a flower in the dark" leans slightly toward stock metaphor at a key beat, though it recovers immediately with the mountain-as-breathing-entity specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's internal contradiction—pride versus safety—drives the arc and is embodied through the platinum labyrinth gestures. His breakthrough comes through concrete decoding rather than abstract epiphany, and the final acceptance of his flaw feels earned. The prince's ghost supplies sufficient pressure, though the uncle's political game remains abstract. Minor deduction: the milkmaid and blacksmith serve as atmosphere rather than applying direct relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's defiance is rooted in her identity as an artist, and her final choice to perform knowing the Wardens will find her carries visible cost. Internal conflict is present—she wants to refract truth while knowing it will bring consequences—and embodied in her "sad, knowing expression" before the climax. Kael's fear provides secondary pressure, though he remains lightly sketched. The motivation holds through escalation, but the interiority occasionally tilts toward elegant phrasing ("a child playing a game with cosmic stakes") rather than raw embodiment under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and drives the narration: conjuring meaning through alchemical repair. Her uncertainty ("an alchemist only by the grace of doubt," "my resolve crumbled") creates productive internal contradiction that sharpens the final choice. The shift from technical doubt to love-driven action at the statue's heart is earned causally by the coral charm anchor. Embodied emotion appears in trembling fingers and chest tightness, though some interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("whispering that I was misremembering").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's grief and private ritual are embodied consistently through gesture and micro-choices (tracing the shell, studying the map, kneeling at the water). The motivation to keep a hidden promise is clear and sustains pressure, though the final act—opening his fingers—lacks visible internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate it into the 8+ band. The reflection on the mirror-crack and "forever shell" is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the present stance. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("intimately aloof," "cathedral of stone and light") fits the painter's sensibility but occasionally reads writerly rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—his belief in whispers over shouts drives the central action. The interiority shows embodied emotion ("a screaming tenderness that had no voice") and micro-choices under pressure (pressing the cork to the lens, closing his eyes). Internal contradiction is present but could be stronger; the conviction feels too settled for the high stakes. The captain's backstory fragment anchors well and tilts the present, but Elias's final silence reads as modest rather than genuinely conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is rooted in personal loss and dramatized through his building project, but his agency remains largely enacted off-stage across weeks. The final scene shows him placing the censer foot and witnessing the signal bloom, yet the choice feels more completion of instructions than a dilemma under pressure. Internal contradiction is limited; his grief is stated but not shown wrestling with competing impulses in the present moment. The tears at the end gesture toward earned emotion, but the stakes never test his commitment with a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's affliction—involuntary truthfulness—is embodied through concrete consequences (trading his entire season's truffles, bracing for painful disclosure) and drives his isolation with visible cost. The final choice shows contradictory impulses acting in scene: he braces for the litany, feels the familiar pressure, then experiences the severance and offers a partial truth with relief. Internal states are rendered through physical sensation ("strange, quiet click," "pressure behind his teeth") rather than diagnostic labels. Minor slip: Lena's memory is told rather than shown in a charged micro-choice, slightly weakening the embodied texture of his protection motive.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "He'd felt this before, this strange echo from objects that held a deep story, a phenomenon he called borrowed memories." His decision to investigate is earned by his isolation and curiosity, and the final placement of the boutonnière on the shelf carries visible cost—he accepts the weight of witnessing. Minor slip: the stranger's "borrowed grief" feels slightly over-articulated for the moment, edging toward summary rather than full embodiment. The renunciation (accepting isolation as shared rather than transcended) forecloses the path of connection with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in his empirical nature and grief. His motivation to uphold Elara's promise drives coherent choices under pressure, and the final renunciation—lowering the chip and walking away—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when he doubts yet persists, and embodied emotion shows in physical detail (cold seeping through jeans, breath unknotting his chest). Minor slip: the epiphany moment ("understood") edges toward summary rather than fully dramatized realization, though the surrounding action supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the silk gloves shroud, the grit she craves, and her final pull-back from the light. Her internal contradiction—seeking escape yet finding agency in refusal—drives the closure choice with visible cost. The "softly commanding" voice recurs purposefully, constraining her role. Minor: Kael remains a functional shadow without distinct interior pressure beyond loyalty.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is embodied through physical action (tracing the shell, cupping the sphere) and her progression from abstract perfection to emotional particularity is earned through Kael's confession. The turn away from the nautilus to pour grief and love into the sphere demonstrates contradictory impulses resolved through choice with visible cost. Minor slip: "scientifically romantic" and "distill feeling" risk over-articulation in the opening, though they anchor her particular obsession. The final choice forecloses her prior method with clear emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in moments like "jealousy for the man who had that dream so overwhelming, that something inside me snapped." Internal contradiction operates well between the desire to chronicle and the impulse to escape. The progression from resenting past selves to seeing them as "points on a single, sprawling map" is earned through the waking-trance flight experience. Minor slip: the final pivot to "artistry" feels slightly pat given the prior psychic wreckage, though the cost of living with fragmentation remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear and her interiority is specific—the "strange certainty that had grown in the silent space her lost sense had left behind" demonstrates earned ability grounded in loss. Her emotional state is embodied through physical action (tremor in hands, practiced movements with the cloth) rather than labeled. The old man's grief is "so old it had become part of his bone structure," a concrete image that avoids therapy-speak. The final moment where she feels "not what was missing, but the extraordinary weight of what remained" earns its shift through the screw-reading scene, though the epiphany risks slight overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interior is concrete and embodied: crystalline veins pulse with cold light, anxiety spreads like frost, the held breath burns. His motivation to transform scars into legible stories is clear and drives the final choice to abandon academic method. The turn from scholarly logic to folk naming is earned by weeks of failure and the grandmother memory, though the whispered acknowledgments ("Hesitation," "Pride," "loneliness") edge toward label-speak without full dramatization of those contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment. The final release is a credible endurance with visible cost—his scholarly framework collapses—but the ease of the shedding slightly undercuts struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian's motivation to apologize is embodied through his physical handling of the perfume bottle and the visceral deluge of sensation during reconnection. Internal contradiction emerges in "It wasn't the reconnection he had wanted, but it was the one he had needed," showing acceptance of an imperfect outcome. Madame Vex remains functional but somewhat stock; her motivation is declared (fee + story) rather than tested under pressure. The final renunciation—letting go of a perfect forgiveness—is earned by the sensory storm and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Witness's motivation to unify and unravel cosmic illusions is told rather than shown through on-page choices. Her journey features zero internal contradiction or embodied struggle; she simply walks, reflects, and dissolves without any competing impulses or visible cost. The final "unraveling" of self reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through dramatized conflict. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical register ("plenum of resolution," "placid machinery") without anchoring in concrete sensation or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated by his philosophical pursuit of what clocks measure, and his interiority is specific and embodied through his ritual counting and the moment of realization. The final stance crystallization—to witness rather than correct—is earned by his grandfather's teaching and his own arc. Minor slip: the transition from "consuming need" to the epiphany reads slightly assured; one more beat of contradictory impulse (wanting to fix vs. wanting to understand) would have sharpened the internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Aris is rendered with sufficient interiority and a coherent through-line from probability-driven rigidity to intuitive acceptance. Her micro-choices—lighting the candle, following each scrawl—feel motivated by the tension between her intellectual rebellion and the raw search her father modeled. The final shift toward understanding him reads earned rather than announced, though the epiphany edges toward tidy articulation. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally relies on abstraction ("clover melancholy") rather than visceral physical anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is anchored through his unusual occupation and his singular motivation ("to teach endings how to begin"), with sufficient interiority around his method. The caller's arc from frayed despair to "observing" rather than asking shows embodied shift. However, Silas himself remains static—a "catalyst who remained unchanged"—which forecloses internal contradiction or cost on his side. The caller's transformation feels more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices that visibly narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "gently thorough" trait shapes her approach, but her final choice at the jetty feels passive—she arrives, witnesses, and shows the locket without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The embodied detail is strong in the workshop ("fingers, stained the deep, rich brown of walnut husks"), but the peak moment lacks contradictory impulses; she experiences "haunted euphoria" but doesn't wrestle with whether to share the discovery or what sharing might cost her professionally or personally. Tomas remains functional but thin, his role limited to recognition rather than applying pressure that forces Elara to choose.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is characterized through concrete action (seeding rumors, watching from shadows, approaching with a fabricated story) and his internal contradiction—holding the moon rock as a talisman while understanding the real cure is community-building—is shown through choice rather than stated. The "desperately jocular" trait manifests in his unanswered questions to pigeons and forced smile, embodied rather than labeled. Minor weakness: the transition from isolation to "not alone" at closure feels slightly undercooked in terms of visible cost; the renunciation of showing the moon rock is present but the emotional price could be sharper. The secondary characters (couple, mechanic, musician) apply immediate pressure by their arrival and hesitation, forcing Silas's pivot from myth to practical engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is consistently embodied through tactile absorption and dowsing, with clear internal contradiction between the quest for silence and the need to engage the forest's overwhelming noise. His grief over Elara drives the journey with concrete goal pursuit (finding the Stillpoint), and the final shift from seeking silence to finding harmony in unified sound reads as earned by the accumulation of musical notes. Minor issue: the "absorbs languages through skin" trait functions more as atmospheric descriptor than a constraint that forces difficult micro-choices under pressure, though it does shape his method throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interior life is richly embodied—guilt, hope, and grief manifest in physical tension ("entire body hunched over the console"). The dual impulse to fix versus understand is contradictory and acts simultaneously in scene, driving the climactic choice to "unbend" his will rather than erase the past. The transition from editor to commentator carries visible cost (abandoning the chance to save thousands) and forecloses the revision path. Minor: the xenobotanist Elara exists only in memory; her faith is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to translate silence into music is concrete and drives his ritual, but his interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("testament of joyful sorrow") rather than embodied contradictions. Lyra functions more as thematic echo than dramatic pressure; her whispers guide rather than complicate. The security guard's mesmerized nod supplies external validation but no friction. The final choice—completing the composition—feels inevitable from the outset rather than earned through visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's interior states are tracked through concrete markers—the tapestry worry-smoothed in his hand, the "quiet detonation in his chest"—and contradictory impulses coexist: volcanic rage versus the intuitive part that "stilled it." The shift from arson to brush-work is earned by the incremental discoveries, though the final resolve ("hands, which had once held a torch, now reached for a brush") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than lived embodiment. Backstory on Elara and the arson is economically seeded without hijacking present pressure, and the closure choice—complete rather than repair—forecasts cost with visible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation—bringing Leo's dream to life despite her entangled memories—is clearly rooted and drives the climactic drumming sequence. Her quiet rebellion through rhythmic tapping is embodied and consistent throughout. The interior work is concrete and particular ("the frantic, joyful beat of his heart when he spoke of their shared dream"), though the final paragraph edges toward abstraction ("a love that science couldn't erase"). One micro-choice strand (slipping from her room, choosing the sensory lab, beginning to drum) supports the ending, but the piece lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's competence is established through concrete sensory detail (identifying walks, navigating by celestial maps) and his motivation is embodied in consistent choices. However, his character verges on idealized competence without genuine struggle—the coin flip is labeled "calculated spontaneity" but reads as costuming rather than authentic doubt. Kaelen is a stock foil whose arrogance exists only to be deflated. The final choice lacks visible cost; Silas wins cleanly without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is embodied through deliberate actions (adjusting shutters, aiming the mirror) that show craft and empathy rather than stating it. The "spiralingly calm" attribute functions concretely in their movements and focus. Internal contradiction is minimal—Kaelen pities the darkness but never wavers—though the piece stays within a narrow emotional register. The piece offers Earned Stasis (continuing the watch with a permanent promise) rather than transformation, which fits the guardian archetype but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated and his attribute (hearing unspoken words) is established, but his interior life remains thin—we observe his plan more than we experience contradictory impulses under pressure. The final beat with Maya demonstrates effect rather than internal cost or foreclosed path. His chess-coach role is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character through that lens. Embodied emotion is sparse; the stone-cradling and listening feel more like staged gestures than lived contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's restless longing is embodied through his fluid motion and pocket habit, with the scrimshaw anchoring his interior conflict. Elara's "combative tenderness" mask cracks under the object's influence, showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to ride the island away is motivated by established desire, though the scrimshaw's heart-unlocking power feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices. Minor: Kaelen's dancer-like grace reads slightly idealized without struggle or misstep under dock work pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's internal contradiction—performing lightness while carrying guilt over Mara's fate—is embodied through the theatrical narration and private whittling. The motivation is concrete: survival through curated absurdity, with moral ambiguity anchored in his passivity during Mara's arrest. The final act of nesting the bird in the bouquet feels earned, closing a circuit between performance and genuine grief. Minor: the "morally ambiguous" framing is slightly over-articulated in the direct authorial aside, but the choice itself carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clearly aesthetically driven and his desire to understand the colonnade's "grammar" through paraphrasing drives the arc. The progression from observer to participant who "dissolves boundaries" shows internal movement, and the final conviction that he must "weave that passage into poems" offers a changed stance. However, the interior work relies heavily on abstract language ("letting his own sense of self to soften at the edges") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the epiphany arrives without visible cost or friction—he shivers from "profound quietude" but no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation (find beauty in imperfection) is clear and his colorblind perception creates a distinct perceptual filter. His "innocently cunning" logic—choosing a single pure note—feels earned. However, his interior life remains somewhat thin; we get his artistic philosophy but few contradictory impulses or embodied emotional stakes beyond admiration of the moonflower's opening. Vex's desperation is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and his patience is demonstrated through specific action—building the apparatus, questioning assumptions. However, the character remains somewhat abstract; his emotions are labeled ("overwhelmed with discovery") rather than fully embodied, and we lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to tune the bell "not to a frequency of hertz, but to a pattern of photons" feels intellectually motivated but emotionally underdeveloped. His predecessor exists only as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's grief and transformation arc is present but operates primarily through reflection rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to help the woman feels sudden—the "sharp need" arrives fully formed without showing the warring impulses that would make it feel earned under pressure. The woman remains almost entirely opaque; we get posture and a single whispered line, but no interior friction or choices that reveal her beyond the withering-to-bloom template. The final image of her at the workbench is told rather than dramatized, and the emotional progression from rock bottom to forge-tending mentor happens largely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to map cultural patterns is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely abstract. The inherited mystery from her father provides backstory anchor, yet her contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene—she moves through explanation mode without visible internal friction. Julian's arc is cleaner: his need to understand is embodied in his hesitant knock and mesmerized watching, but he functions primarily as receiver rather than applying pressure that forces Elara into a costly choice. The ending gesture—remaining at the table—reads as continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (pursuit of forbidden knowledge) is clear and her preparation is dramatized, but her internal contradictions remain abstract. The "tapestry of unconventional connections" and "steadily unpredictable engine" are told qualities rather than shown through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation into a "shimmering composite" offers a cost, but the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied—we're told she's changed but don't experience the struggle in the moment of dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is grounded and his method is consistent with his established traits. The love that "outlived its object" produces embodied choices: he refuses to slash-and-burn corrupted files, opts for comparative method, and whispers reassurance at the climax. Internal contradiction is present—grief versus duty—but the character tilts toward contemplative rather than genuinely contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act earns the integration with visible cost (accepting the shadow as part of Elara), though the interiority occasionally uses elevated register ("abiding sorrow," "luminous regret") that sits at the edge of diagnostic label-speak without crossing into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and his interior work—anger dissolving into focus on the chameleon—feels embodied through the prosthetic's construction. The "tangled knot" of self-respect versus compassion drives the final realization without therapy-speak intrusion. Minor slip: "the belief that a shared love for the natural world implied a shared decency felt like a fool's dream" leans slightly abstract but recovers quickly through the hands-on repair. The final turn earns its cost: honoring his gentle nature rather than guarding it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and his internal contradiction—seeking closure while perpetually reopening wounds—drives the entire piece with embodied specificity. The ivy communion provides a distinct perceptual lens, and the final renunciation (archivist rather than closer) is earned by the tunneling failure. Minor slip: the "woman whose scar had started his obsession" appears only as backstory furniture without altering present stakes. The procedure scar functions well as both wound and catalyst, grounding interiority in physical particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "find where unused love is stored" is poetic but remains abstract throughout; her psychometric process involves no difficult choices or visible internal conflict. The vision of Arthur is richly embodied with his pen's weight and frantic rhythm, yet Elara herself never wrestles with contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from question to answer. The final realization feels like a delivered epiphany rather than one earned through struggle with visible cost. Interiority is vivid but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interiority is concretely embodied—the "crushing static" of psychic noise, fingers "stained with brass polish and starlight"—and her motivation (finding rest by freeing creativity) drives her nightly ritual. The epiphany that transforms her perception of the valley's noise into "remembered stardust" feels somewhat abrupt; the leap from torment to cosmic plainsong lacks intermediate contradiction or struggle that would make the shift more earned. The final choice to sketch faces is motivated, but the emotional progression from isolation to connection resolves quickly without visible internal resistance. Minor: the "moonstruck dreamer" label and "affliction…of the soul" edge toward stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interior is richly specific—"occasionally everywhere" materializes as embodied sensation ("a net cast across the glowing sand"), and contradictory impulses appear when the pine memory triggers both mission loyalty and a phantom-limb ache. The final stirring toward dream is earned by the synthesis act and closes a want the opening declared absent. Minor deduction: the archive's anthropomorphized "restlessness" occasionally edges into tell rather than showing Kaelen's perception of chaotic data. No second character pressures stakes, so relationship bullets are not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistent and voiced through the "stray philosopher" lens, but his internal journey proceeds without meaningful contradiction or cost. The climactic "understanding" arrives as pure insight without dramatized struggle—he simply "let[s] go of reason," the hum swells, and revelation appears. The final reframing of the gear from broken piece to "complete thing" and his shift from dread to eagerness read as tidy emotional resolution rather than earned through conflicting impulses. Embodied emotion is present in the disorientation and focus, but the arc lacks the friction required to make the change feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is grounded in embodied emotion ("heart a slow drum") and her agency drives the final steps into the mist. However, the core realization about courage—"not an object to be found, but a muscle to be flexed"—edges into articulated epiphany rather than dramatized discovery through action. The guides remain atmospheric observers without internal contradiction or pressure, limiting relational crucible. Minor deduction for the somewhat direct statement of theme in the penultimate paragraph, though the final action partially rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—fingers worrying the bolt, phantom tingle of nerves, frostbite as clarity—with contradictory impulses (flee vs. remain) dramatized through micro-choices. The silent soloist in room 313 applies pressure without becoming a secondary character, and the final act (leaving the bolt) is motivated by prior guilt and carries visible cost: forfeiting the protective silence. Internal conflict operates simultaneously rather than alternating, and the embodied emotions avoid therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to restore balance is clear and sustained, and his choice to dissolve the pellet drives the climax. However, his interiority remains abstract—"his entire being bent on a single concept"—without embodied contradiction or vulnerability. The titan's weariness is asserted ("profoundly weary") but never shapes a micro-choice or complicates his execution. Agency is present but emotion stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivation is concrete and rooted in grief over Lena's disappearance and the reef's death, driving his obsessive rhythm-tapping practice. His interiority shows genuine contradiction—mourning versus seeking, isolation versus connection—embodied in physical action (drumming, studying charts). The final choice to accept the "once in a while" reaching feels earned by his progression from defeat to revelation. Minor weakness: Lena remains an absence rather than a presence that tests his loyalty in scene, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete—"discover meaning in the mess" drives her choices throughout. The progression from "awkwardly confident gait" to "pure, focused confidence of a virtuoso" is earned through her practiced method. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her physical awkwardness and her precision with the ancient resonance, though the piece stops short of showing this duality constrain a high-cost choice. The final stance crystallizes her purpose but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—she opposes predictability through biological insurgency—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation ("whispered of pressure, of heat") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The "strange gift, an accidental telepathy with plants" functions as a label that enables action but never imposes visible cost or internal friction; she executes the unsealing flawlessly without struggle, blind spots, or credible failure risk. The final moment offers no meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost—she watches "the miracle of her defiance unfold" as pure validation, foreclosing no path and paying no price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anya's interiority is concrete and embodied: the ice spreading through veins, jaw clenching, fingers locked. The photograph functions as a physical anchor rather than exposition, and the panic attack sequence tracks contradictory impulses (the need to freeze versus the need to ground). The final choice—watering the pine—emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the acknowledgment that "the sky would always hold a potential for menace"). Minor slip: "quietly talented" remains a label without on-page demonstration of what that talent costs or enables in this specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's fragmented perception is embodied through his inability to see whole faces and his slashed canvases, creating consistent interior contradiction. The shift from crestfallen artist to "cartographer of the fractured soul" is earned through the sustained engagement with the box fragments and threads, showing work rather than epiphany. The final renunciation of mending in favor of redesign carries visible cost in his charcoal-blackened hands and years of quiet. Minor therapy-adjacent phrasing ("luminescent ache," "descended into necessary darkness") approaches label-speak but stays anchored in bodily perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("serene anger, cold and clean as the stone"), and his decision to abandon rescue efforts in favor of tracking the drone is character-consistent. The mystery-hunter motive is established clearly, though the time-slowing phenomenon remains more told than dramatized in his present choices. Embodied emotion is strong ("his red eyes narrowing to slits"), but the final choice to step into the ink feels more like execution of a known method than a decision made under competing pressures with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict is established early and drives the climactic choice, with bodily response ("wave of vertigo," "trembled") grounding the emotional stakes. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("schism running through the core," "professional vows and personal conscience") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation carries weight, but the turn from decades of loyalty to immediate sedition feels compressed; the intermediate micro-choices that would earn such a leap are summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her contradictory impulses—nurturing versus the inheritance of violence—act simultaneously in the knife scene. The choice to sheathe rather than discard or destroy is motivated by layered emotion (accepting heritage, denying its power) with visible cost: she contains the weapon, locking away a future. Minor slip: the father's presence is described rather than dramatized, weakening the crucible slightly. The final image of the rose "brimming with quiet strength" delivers earned character signature.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his "transliterate emotions" trait is shown through the counter-frequency hum, but his interior life remains largely opaque throughout the pursuit. The final moment where he "ceased to be a man and became an antenna for sorrow" reads as assertion rather than embodied transformation—we're told the grief fills him but the cost of that receptivity never pressures a choice. The ending grants success without visible trade-off or foreclosed path; he simply walks away with "a new kind of memory" in the spike, which feels cosmetic rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Celeste's motivation to defend her father is established through years of observation, and her final choice to call the journalist shows agency. However, the core emotional work—her transformation from observer to intervener—happens too smoothly without embodied cost or internal contradiction in the moment. The "devotedly observant daughter" trait remains a label more than a lived constraint that shapes her tactics under pressure. The phone-call debate itself lacks micro-hesitations or competing impulses that would make her decision feel earned rather than pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's guilt-driven motivation is established early and embodied through his ritual tattooing, with the amber piece serving as a concrete anchor. The recognition of his own handwriting and the final sequence show agency under pressure, though the transition from "another life" memory to present action relies on convenient recovered knowledge. The choice to etch the constellation and place the amber carries visible cost in that he finally confronts rather than flees the hum. Internal contradiction appears when he both cannot outrun the memory yet somehow forgot writing the letters, creating mild motivation friction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal state is rendered through concrete sensory detail ("paint-stained fingers," reading "the slump of a shoulder like a paragraph of loss"), and her motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives the mandala creation. However, the other wanderers remain undifferentiated islands—no individual contradictory impulses or embodied reactions beyond generic hollowed-out expressions. The final shift ("A man who had been staring at his own reflection…now stared at the mandala's golden spirals") gestures at change but lacks the micro-choices or visible cost that would elevate the transformation to earned alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through his actions with the tessera and the Retro, but his interiority remains largely static—a "warm coldness" that doesn't evolve or show contradictory impulses under pressure. The man's transformation from Joric to Ren lacks earned resistance; the "silent battle" is asserted rather than dramatized through specific behavioral friction. The final exchange feels tidy rather than costly, and Kaelen's own "retrocognitively trapped" state is told in one reflective line without on-page micro-choices that alter his present stance. The piece delivers a change but not one earned by visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian's motivation is clear and his agency shapes the narrative arc through deliberate ghostly interventions. However, his interiority remains somewhat abstract—synesthesia is told through metaphor ("colors, chords of sensation") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Elara's despair is labeled more than dramatized in micro-choices; her transformation from weeping to purposeful exit feels swift without visible internal friction. The piece delivers character-driven causality but lacks the embodied contradictions and micro-choice texture that would elevate it to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's progression from "affectionate skeptic" to someone whose "skepticism wavered" feels earned through embodied experience—the cold dread blooming in his sternum, his protective wave of affection. Lena's fierce belief and the somatic specificity of her grief ("That cold... I've never been able to describe it") ground both characters in contradictory impulses. The final intertwining of fingers with pulse awareness embodies the closure choice. Minor slip: "willowglass hope" in the final paragraph edges toward label-speak, but the immediate grounding in the geode and pulse rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her professional competence is well-established through sensory mapping work. The floating transformation is physically grounded through resonant frequency mechanics, though the final merger with cave consciousness feels told rather than dramatically embodied with contradictory impulses. The choice to open herself lacks visible internal conflict—no fear, hesitation, or cost dramatized in the moment of surrender. Minor deduction for the elm leaf fossil functioning as pure anchor without complicating her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and dramatized through action—he works at night to unscramble history rather than obey prophecy. The button-cataloging method embodies his careful, monastic approach and each choice (placing the weaver's button, the legionnaire's clasp, the fire-warden's toggle) reveals his belief that small decisions compound into fate. Internal contradiction is present but muted: his quiet defiance never truly wrestles with fear or cost until the final act. The ending choice—walking past the hourglass—feels somewhat abrupt; the renunciation lacks visible struggle in the moment, though prior cataloging establishes his intent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in Vienna guilt, with the pillbox serving as a concrete anchor. The internal contradiction between his burned status and his leap of faith creates pressure, and the revelation that his colleague survived forces a meaningful choice. However, the interiority leans heavily on exposition ("a quiet ache," "unused courage") rather than embodied contradiction in the present moment, and the final turn feels more like relief than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear interiority through concrete embodiment—the needle's coolness, the fog as a "familiar cloak"—and his internal work of distilling the promise into compassion is earned through specific stimuli. The palimpsest metaphor itself is slightly over-articulated ("First came the layer of necessity...") but the contradiction between guilt and function drives his arc. The final loosening of the knot via understanding rather than undoing is credible endurance with visible cost: he releases the old vow by accepting its transformation. Minor slip: the epiphany leans slightly abstract in the penultimate paragraph but recovers with the concrete action of slipping the needle away.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's potter-specific perception (clay having memory, hands shaping earth back into purpose) is concrete and drives his choices. The final act—rebuilding the channel—shows clear agency with visible cost (forgetting food, forgetting night). Interior motivation is consistent throughout, though the "zen-minded" label does more work than embodied contradiction under pressure. The progression from observation to intervention feels earned, but the interiority remains somewhat externalized rather than showing simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—lowering the gauge tooth, maintaining the rhythm. Her interiority shows purposeful restraint and inherited values without therapy-speak. The final micro-shift (Mr. Henderson's blinds widening) feels earned by her sustained effort, though the choice to continue rather than stop lands quietly. Internal contradiction is present but mild: she respects his solitude yet intrudes nightly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior life is concrete and embodied through the memory shards ("tasting salt on a primeval wind, feeling the coarse fur"), and his motivation—translating isolation into independence—drives the central action. The realization that memories are "reflections, not revenants" feels earned by the stone circle experience. However, the shift from "crushing isolation" to "quiet kingdom" arrives through contemplation rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the change reads more as acceptance than transformation with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently held—her quest for connection drives the final act of letting go. Internal contradiction is present (keeper of secrets versus needing connection), but it remains largely reflective rather than creating genuine on-page struggle between competing impulses in the moment. The change at the end feels somewhat declared ("she suddenly understood") rather than fully earned through embodied tension. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward poetic summary in places ("deep, quiet ache," "pang of both kinship and terror").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and layered—outwitting cosmic tricksters to save a fracturing community—with visible micro-choices (spreading the chart, engaging the sequence) that embody her contradictory impulses: dread versus cautiously hopeful persistence. The interiority is character-particular ("a sliver of something else persisted") and the final tension draining is embodied. Minor slip: the tricksters remain abstract antagonists never tested on-page, slightly limiting the earned quality of her endurance, but her agency at closure (transmitting the counter-frequency, watching the fever break) forecloses passivity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia and the Architect's legacy provide clear motivation, and the compass-point choice at climax shows embodied decision under pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("cold and sharp," "fraying sanity," "desperate clarity") and the protagonist's internal contradiction—a claustrophobic explorer—is declared more than it complicates on-page choices. The final discovery feels like external validation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's prosopagnosia is established but functions primarily as premise rather than creating on-page contradictory impulses that complicate choices. His motivation to awaken empathy is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final emotional pang reads as label-speak ("a sharp, aching sorrow") rather than embodied cost, and his internal journey lacks friction—he seeks empathy, executes his ritual, and finds it without meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The character remains more conceptual vehicle than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and sustained, grounded in family legacy and idealism. Internal state is embodied through physical gestures (thumb over nail, breath hitching, heart hammering). However, the trait "nervously confident" is largely asserted rather than shown in contradictory action; the progression from nervousness to "clean, bright fire of confidence" reads as emotional arithmetic rather than earned struggle with visible cost. Micro-choices exist but feel low-stakes until the final transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is articulated but remains mostly internal declaration rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final decision to learn the fluttering pattern arrives as epiphany without prior visible struggle or foreclosed option. "Dynamically observant" reads as a label; the trait enables perception but never constrains a choice with cost. The glass flake and Lyra's vanishing provoke wonder, yet no contradictory impulse complicates his immediate leap toward possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is well-drawn with clear interior contradiction: he cultivates calm as a shield against his violent inheritance while actively manipulating the landscape. The transition from passive observer to tactical actor is motivated, and the final renunciation—placing the money back in the satchel—feels earned by the comparison cycle he's traced. Minor weakness: the CEO arrives as a convenient foil rather than a fully realized pressure point, his quick capitulation slightly undermining the cost of Elias's victory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent—decoding the temple inscriptions—but his interior life leans heavily on label-speak ("weary resignation," "profound and enveloping calm") rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from burden to shared solace is asserted more than earned through on-page micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths. The dream-state witnessing is passive observation; agency arrives only in the writing act at the end, which reads more as cathartic release than a choice with visible cost. Interiority remains character-particular in diction but emotional progression feels smoothed rather than contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior is strongly rendered through embodied perception ("the quiet of the deep woods within her," "her serenity a blade cutting through the psychic noise"), and the final weeping marks a credible shift earned by the discovered truth. The trait "finds lost things" appears as sympathetic excavation with visible cost ("felt her own guarded nature cracking"). Diagnostic label-speak appears ("warlike serenity," "disciplined power") but remains integrated into the POV's druidic idiom. Minor slip: the confession's content ("I wasn't strong enough") trends toward therapeutic articulation rather than lived utterance, slightly flattening the peak emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular; her root-bound state and the Dissonance scars provide embodied contradiction. The connection with Kael shows purposeful internal conflict—she must heed his warning while pushing her own vision. Motivation is consistent and the final choice (creating a new path rather than following existing ones) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: she risks the false intersection and must synthesize warning and logic. Minor slip: the "anxious elation" pairing feels slightly performed rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is concrete—patching the hole in Elara's soul—and his actions (pressing the stone, offering the memory) are embodied and driven by internal contradiction (guilt vs. hope). The "fiercely gentle" attribute constrains his method throughout. Minor weakness: Elara remains off-page, so the relational crucible is felt only through Aris's interiority. The final gesture (burying the tarot card) earns the renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with his dual expertise (roadie/appraiser) embodied in "fingers, calloused from hauling amps and now delicate from handling porcelain." The physical struggle with the cloth ("knuckles scraped against the cheap plastic casing") effectively externalizes internal conflict. The motivation to "discover purpose after loss" drives the scene's single sustained choice to examine the box, and the final decision to place the cloth on his desk rather than catalog or discard it demonstrates a micro-choice with visible cost—he's keeping evidence of pain rather than sealing it away. Minor deduction for the phrase "confidently uncertain, a master of the material world but a novice in the geography of his own heart," which edges toward label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand "the physics of transition" is clear and rooted in grief, driving her methodical work with the seed. Her interior landscape is concrete—"a still, deep well of sorrow"—and her choice to plant the seed forecloses pure mourning, shifting to inquiry with visible cost. The analogical thinking method is embodied through her translator's lens, showing her mind at work. Minor slip: the leap to "complex waveform" and "phase transition" reads slightly over-articulated for someone in the midst of grief, edging toward diagnostic clarity that no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelan's migration between Archivist and Smelter personas shows embodied contradiction—the "rigid certainty" softening, gears "loosening like a relaxing fist"—grounded in moon-phase mechanics. The empathetic heat that seeks "the core of each memory" demonstrates interior complexity under pressure. However, the transformation feels pre-programmed rather than chosen; Kaelan processes the memory-ore without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final return to "cool, wintersun serenity" reads as cyclical duty rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "dissolve the walls between hearts" is stated clearly but arrives as exposition rather than through contradictory impulses in scene. His final choice—placing the pearl—reads as decisive but the hesitation beat ("his entire life played out") relies on summary rather than embodied contradiction. The warm pearl and etched confessions provide concrete sensory anchors, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract until the climax, limiting the felt cost of his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is grounded through embodied sensation—"world felt like sandpaper against his nerves"—and the accordion's material presence anchors grief without label-speak. His methodical search contrasts with desperate logic, creating credible contradiction. The shift from physical mapping to internal agency is earned through the graffiti encounter, which catalyzes renunciation (leaving the accordion) with visible cost. Minor: the brother's death remains abstract; one concrete sensory flashback would deepen the guilt's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early and sustained, but her interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("desperate," "cautious exuberance," "brilliant victory") that labels emotion rather than embodying it through contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure. The watch-guided choreography shows goal-directed action, yet the final "Stay" revelation feels received rather than earned by a visible internal conflict that forecloses a path. The piece maintains consistent focalization and avoids head-hopping, but the emotional progression reads more as smooth escalation than the messy, contradictory layering that would lift characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior is concrete and character-particular, embodied through physical details (mulberry ache, trembling hands, throat tightening). The progression from comfortable researcher to active traitor is motivated by the plant-memory revelation and coffee prophecy convergence. The final choice—cutting the vine, writing the truth-report—carries visible cost (trading an empire for a stem) and forecloses his prior life. Minor slip: the "dream of a world that breathes against an empire that suffocates" edges toward abstract thesis rather than pure embodiment, but the surrounding action anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently signaled, but her interior life remains largely label-driven ("lucidly watchful," "artist's touch and surgeon's precision") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—placing the gem in the locket—feels procedural rather than earned through on-page struggle; no path is foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied emotion is minimal; the work proceeds smoothly without mistakes or friction that would test her competence or reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and her micro-choices (climbing the tree, using the hairpin) are embodied and particular. The interior contradiction between inherited passivity and interventionist love creates credible tension. However, the final realization "she had become it" edges toward label-speak and the reflective block dominates the middle third without sufficient interleaved pressure. The brother's betrayal and forgiveness backstory is invoked but never constrains a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation is concrete and embodied through the wind-chime ritual and hollow mirror shard, with "sincerely insincere" texture in the calibrated voice. Kaelen's arc from conviction to doubt is earned by the sustained pressure of the night and the narrator's method, culminating in the clasp-unhooking action that externalizes interior shift. The internal contradiction—offering comfort through doubt—is dramatized rather than declared. Minor slip: Kaelen's emotional progression leans slightly tell-heavy in "his certainty was fighting back" rather than fully embodied gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's desire to find his sister anchors his impatience and creates internal contradiction—he must learn to release the anchor to move through space. Elara's backward-aging condition is embodied through her ancient eyes in a young face, and her motivation to teach before her knowledge retreats is clear and poignant. The final realization feels earned through the pond meditation sequence, though Elara's "weaves truth carefully, guiding his perception" and "withhold the rest" occasionally drifts toward tell rather than dramatized constraint. The cost—releasing the shout of one's own existence—lands with weight in Kael's final "I see."

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan's motivation is clear and shapes the action: the desire to navigate without moving drives the stone-skimming art and the climactic gesture. The character's reverent nature constrains their search method (waiting rather than disturbing) with visible cost in patience. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("quiet fire," the resonance felt in palm), though the final epiphany moment—realizing the path unfurls—edges toward epiphanic convenience. The protagonist's agency is clear but the transformation from listener to guide feels slightly telescoped in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior is consistently realized through concrete failures and the "knot of inadequacy," with his motivation—finding the sacred in the simple—embodied through rejection of diagnostics. The final choice to remove the pack and touch the keystone feels earned by prior causality. However, the epiphany moment leans toward abstraction ("a way of seeing") and some interiority edges into therapy-speak ("simple, profound confidence"). The agency and transformation are present but the closure beat's language slightly dulls embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is motivated by grief and a promise, with interiority grounded in concrete ritual (lighting lamps, checking equipment) that builds a wall against terror. The dive's psychological pressure is embodied through sensory deprivation and the shift from factual checklist to memory-driven synesthesia. The final "answer" feels somewhat convenient—indigo blooms behind closed eyes without prior perceptual struggle—softening what should be a harder-won transformation. Elara remains a sketch; her belief is told rather than dramatized through past conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and voice-particular: "wavelength align with purpose" drives every choice. His "stellar doubt" is embodied in the pit-of-stomach tightening and the physical act of drawing the coin, not merely stated. The final renunciation—shifting from future prophet to past curator—is earned by the discovery and charged by the backwards-prophecy text. Interior texture remains consistent under pressure, though the leap from "madman listening to ghosts" to "profound certainty" could have shown one more contradictory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation—mapping grief through crystallization—is consistently embodied through his handling of the prism and audio player, with clear internal contradiction between his duty as silent witness and his need to anchor loss. The final renunciation (placing the crystal on the console rather than keeping it) forecloses the path of drowning in nameless fear with visible cost: he remains heartbroken but no longer lost. Interiority occasionally drifts toward elevated metaphor ("vast and monstrous geography of his own sorrow") but stays rooted in concrete gestures. Elara exists only in recorded echo, so no relationship pressure tests Kael on the page; the piece leans entirely on solo interiority and symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and internally consistent—he believes the world is sleeping, not dead, and his "earnest naivete" shields him from despair. His ninety-seven days of repetition embody contradictory impulses: brittle devotion versus crushing futility. The final choice (adjusting drip intervals) is earned by prior observation and desperation. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling fingers," exhausted slump), though the phrase "faith as pure as it was fragile" edges toward label-speak without quite crossing the line.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is specific and embodied throughout ("the loss felt measured in ghosts," his hands steady during the act of correction). The arc from perfunctory duty to obsessive inquiry to purposeful witnessing is causally earned. The great-uncle remains opaque—face literally scratched out—so the character work centers on Elias and his grandfather's storytelling motive, which reads credibly. Minor slip: the shift from "quiet obsession" to community educator feels slightly compressed in the final beats, though the trade-off (private quest to public witness) carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistently character-specific, rooted in his intellectual rigidity and hidden sentimentality. The transformation feels earned through the sequence of abandoning analysis → observing the starlings → approaching the tree → using the locket as reverence. However, the final shift to "intuitive click" and "flowing grace" verges on abstract label-speak rather than fully embodied contradiction. The renunciation of pure logic is clear, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied—the parachute buckle ritual shows internal conflict through action rather than summary. His attentively inventive nature drives the power-distribution schematic without feeling like a label. The piece demonstrates genuine struggle (the trembling hand) balanced with competence, and the final choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "watcher's burden" phrasing occasionally drifts toward thesis statement rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's emotional numbness is embodied through flat affect and focused perception, and his drive to feel again threads consistently through the vivify attempt. The "slices through pretense" attribute works functionally when he reads Jin's fear. However, the interior relies heavily on elevated abstraction ("dissolution," "phantom limb of an emotion") that distances rather than grounds, and the final beat's "terrifying sense of responsibility" arrives as a label rather than a contradictory impulse enacted in scene. The micro-choice to proceed despite Jin's protest is present but the embodied cost remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ghost protagonist's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—restoring laughter through the only medium left to him. His "mournfully eager" disposition manifests in embodied action (gathering sorrow into the pull cord) rather than labels. The wife's micro-response (tear + fragile smile) earns the shift, though the son remains a background placeholder. Interior contradiction is present but thin; the ghost's desperation could have been tested more sharply against futility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyel's motivation is embodied through contradictory impulses—dimensional homesickness coexisting with feral guardianship—and the pendant functions as a concrete crucible forcing a choice between longing and duty. His final decision to smother the portal by pouring his own waiting into the pendant demonstrates agency with visible cost: he forecloses the path home and accepts continued exile. Interior texture is character-particular ("interiorizing exteriors," "feral thing of sharp senses") and the renunciation earns Earned Stasis. Minor slip: the phrase "make friends with uncertainty" reads slightly diagnostic in tone but is integrated quickly into action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and particular—his "frantic sensitivity churning within" and the way "each failed experiment felt like a small death" ground his struggle in embodied emotion. The epiphany at the climax ("He wasn't a shepherd, and this was not a flock") arrives through concrete realization tied to the crozier's form, avoiding label-speak. However, the transformation from command to surrender, while causally set up, reads somewhat too clean; the final state ("raw, silent awe") lacks the contradictory impulses that charged earlier beats. Minor: "stoic mask finally cracking" is a stock gesture that doesn't individuate his relief.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and abstract ("find the beginning in every ending"), embodied through her defiant choice to jury-rig the fragment despite prior failure. Internal contradiction is present—despair versus practical defiance—and the final choice feels earned by her mentor's lesson and on-page experimentation. However, interiority occasionally leans toward telling ("familiar despair began to settle") rather than full embodiment, and the mentor's wisdom arrives as a clean epiphany without messier friction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Finn's "resiliently positive nature" is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation crystallizes suddenly ("a sudden, terrifying clarity") without prior internal conflict dramatized through micro-choices. The shift from deckhand to cosmic problem-solver reads as competence without struggle; his steady hands complete the task without visible cost to his prior identity. Captain Eva and passengers remain catatonic props, offering no relational pressure to test Finn's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover the texture of connection") is coherent and drives the weaving throughout. The memory shift (mother's hand warm→cold) creates internal contradiction that propels his choices, but the final "hollowness" feels slightly asserted rather than fully embodied in prior micro-choices. The protagonist's agency is present but the cost—becoming trapped in his own construct—arrives more as conceptual statement than visceral consequence earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his professional lens shapes perception throughout. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between duty to the city and cosmic pull, though it remains abstract rather than embodied in visceral competing impulses during peak beats. The council scene shows him making a high-stakes pitch but the choice itself—standing before the council—feels pre-determined rather than wrestled with on the page. The anchor-to-chain-link metaphor does constrain his final rhetoric, lending modest embodiment to his stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows consistent trait-driven action (persistent curiosity, technical competence), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle under pressure. Leo's emotional arc from defeat to peace is told more than dramatized; the crumpling face and slow breaths are gestures, not layered contradictions. The final "shepherd toward calm" phrasing edges into abstraction rather than grounding the cost of this work in Elias's body or psyche. Motivation is clear but not tested by genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia and grief are embodied through physical detail—cold sweat, ragged breathing, the tightness in his chest that opens at closure. His contradictory impulses (fear of enclosed spaces vs. duty to grandmother) drive the phase-transition choice with visible cost. The interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the shift from "my grandmother" to "his grandmother" creates brief pronoun confusion, and the motivation could show more internal resistance before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is well-embodied through the pulse-counting gesture, anchored in concrete contradiction (bureaucratic ghost vs. living heartbeat). The motivation to salvage Aris's wisdom is clear and sustained through the defragmentation ritual. Internal conflict remains implied rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her acceptance of the error feels contemplative rather than torn. The final shift from "curse" to "space with potential" is earned by the ink revelation but edges toward epiphany language without full dramatization of the renunciation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's interior life is concrete and particular—the copper veins as sensory organ, the obsession with texture-to-sound translation—and the choice to use the diamond at the starling-pattern moment is dramatized with bodily trembling and felt stakes. The motivation is consistent and embodied across the arc. However, the protagonist's final success feels unopposed; there is no dramatized internal contradiction or cost at the climactic beat—Kaelen aligns the diamond, silence blooms, success arrives—without a visible struggle or renunciation that would elevate the closure into earned change with felt forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Julian's motivation is concrete and contradictory—bitterness seeking exposure transforms into protective secrecy—with embodied tension in his observation of the client's transformation. The renunciation (setting down the phone) forecloses his original mission with visible cost: abandoning the organization's goal and accepting Clara's irreversible change. Interior voice is specific ("cosmically stupid," "frostbitten hope") and the final choice feels earned by accumulated witnessing. Minor issue: Clara's silence and fascination with rain are told rather than shown in micro-choices, slightly weakening her characterization as pressure on Julian.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—but her interior life skews abstract. The weeks of experimentation are summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the sense of earned discovery. Her final choice to "uproot the very foundation" arrives with declarative certainty ("She knew what she had to do") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion appears in "nervous flutter" and "frantic drum," but the epiphany moment lacks genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation—to mend broken promises—drives consistent choices under pressure, from mapping drone gaps to executing the transfer. His interiority is concrete ("quiet ache," the weight of duty) and embodied through action (uncorking the bottle, checking the timepiece). The final choice to continue deliveries is earned by the successful transfer and the bluebird confirmation, though the piece leans toward competence over struggle; Elias executes flawlessly without meaningful misstep or internal contradiction in the peak beat. Minor: the promise-mending thesis occasionally edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is given a clear, character-particular motivation ("to interpret silence as possibility") that drives his patient restoration work and culminates in the climactic singing. His interiority is embodied through his hands and tools rather than label-speak. The singing moment feels earned by a decade of silence and the patient work, though the emotional progression from silent carpenter to singer could show more internal contradiction or struggle in the build-up. Minor: the mare's "glass eyes staring at a future she would never run toward" edges into pathetic fallacy that slightly dilutes POV discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies throughout, his "sanely eccentric habits" embodied in the precise arrangement of books and the scarf ritual. Internal experience differs meaningfully from external calm—the "tremor in his hands" and "breathtaking moment" land with embodied specificity. The choice to continue ("his shift was far from over") reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (patience, solitude, incremental progress), though the stakes remain somewhat abstract. Minor slip: the vision itself ("a woman's laugh") arrives as declarative memory rather than contradictory impulse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is motivated by specific loss—a "runaway dream" rendered as warmth and half-remembered smile—and his obsessive ritual is concrete and embodied. Internal contradiction appears in the "luminous absence that hollowed out his days," yet his final acceptance reads quickly; the transition from years of failure to immediate contentment lacks visible struggle or cost at the moment of resolution. The palette's mechanics are vivid, but Silas himself remains somewhat abstract; we see method more than the man's flaws or fears under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Locksmith's motivation is declared ("to free an idea trapped behind fear") but never tested by competing impulses or meaningful internal friction. The woman exists solely to deliver backstory and witness the resolution, applying no pressure to his choices. The humming and starlight manipulation proceed without error, cost, or visible struggle—competence without complication flattens characterization. No path is foreclosed; the "payment" of silence where longing was carries no dramatized weight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in recovering stolen memories, and the trait of chronic curiosity drives his decision to break his long-held rule. The moment of choosing to touch the mushroom shows genuine internal conflict between academic caution and personal need. The embodied emotion ("tremor he hadn't felt since he was a boy," breath fogging glass) grounds the pressure. Minor weakness: the backstory about the flooded coastline feels slightly decorative rather than constraining present choices, but the closure choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivations are clear and embodied through his scarred physicality and backward walking tell. His desire to mentor while protecting himself from past failure creates authentic internal friction. Elara's final choice to stay and rebuild is earned by the progression from passivity ("her voice small") to agency (restacking scrolls). The "combative tenderness" method and his terror when mapping her path show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though Elara's interior remains thinner than Kael's.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority leans heavily on abstract, elevated register ("insatiably creative," "transcendent cure," "spiritual ailment") that reads declarative rather than embodied under pressure. His motivation is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; the seed-planting sequence unfolds without visible hesitation or tradeoff. The "giving the seed a soul" beat compresses what could be a fraught decision into smooth execution, missing the contradictory impulses that would ground high-stakes agency. Embodiment is present in gestures (kneeling, closing eyes) but emotional texture remains abstract—no sweat, tremor, or visceral fear that the technique might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (working the knot with the needle). Kaelen's fear is shown through "pale" and "trembling hand," though his arc remains minimal at this length. The comparison of spirit-work to mask restoration provides character-specific interiority. Minor slip: the sailor's "curse against the waves" is told rather than dramatized, and Kaelen's transformation from fear to "solemn understanding" feels slightly rushed without a visible micro-choice that earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her methodical curiosity drives her from the torn map to the archives and finally to annotation. The trait "shielded openness" operates as both descriptor and constraint, filtering her perceptions and choices. Her decision at closure to annotate rather than repair feels earned by the prior discovery sequence. However, interiority occasionally edges toward elevated register ("empathetic rush that breached her careful shields") that reads slightly outside the working conservator's lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and purposeful, showing embodied emotion through the physical exploration and the interaction with "Mortimer" as a projected presence. The final shift—understanding the "physics of letting go"—is earned through the father's cautionary example, with visible cost in the decision to leave the globe. Minor slip: the narrator's professional detachment occasionally verges on over-articulation ("existential pressure"), and the relationship with Mortimer remains slightly opaque, reducing full emotional specificity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is rich with concrete detail (the flower press plate, the graffiti language), and his motivation—translating Lyra's formless loneliness—grounds his choices. However, his emotional state stays within a narrow band; the "driftingly alert calm" and "weary smile" bookend the piece without meaningful internal friction or embodied cost. The final moment of success feels declarative rather than earned through visible sacrifice or contradiction—he achieves communion but doesn't renounce or forfeit anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is distinct and embodied—"warmly inquisitive" manifests in concrete micro-choices (opening the diary, lifting the goggles). His emotional progression from duty to protective understanding reads as earned, with the final stance ("affectionate detachment") foreclosing intimacy while accepting cost. The Captain exists only through artifacts and memory, which is appropriate for this lens, but her motherhood reveal lacks contradictory impulses in Kael's processing—he accepts it cleanly without friction. Minor: "trembling slightly" is a stock embodiment that could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior is consistent and particular—his method of categorizing clouds by emotion and the belief that "empty spaces remember" drive his purpose with visible embodiment. His stance crystallizes in the final recognition of "The Unbroken Spool" fractal as proof, a renunciation that forecloses further search with quiet cost. The interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains grounded in concrete action (retrieving telescope, logging observations). Minor limitation: Lena exists only in reflection; no on-page contradiction complicates Elias's processing of grief, leaving the arc slightly monotone.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's face-blindness shapes her artistic stance credibly—she reads anxieties and postures rather than features—but the final act (pressing the stone) is given rather than chosen, reducing agency at closure. Interior texture is strong through fingertip work and sensory bias; the embodied connection to pigments and touch reads character-particular. Motivation remains consistent, though the dying master's whisper diminishes her ownership of the goal. No internal contradiction or competing impulse surfaces to deepen the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—his observational focus, the link between isolation and diligence, and the final shift from "apprentice" to "cartographer" emerge through scene pressure rather than label. The characterization works through embodied micro-choices: kneeling with the phrasebook, cross-referencing under time pressure, sketching furiously. Internal contradiction is light but present in the tension between "sociable isolation" and "profound...need," though it could deepen. The change from hunting to discovering communion is earned by the sequence of pattern-reading, but the cost (what path is foreclosed?) remains implicit rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to repair the Orrery is clearly established and her locksmith lineage informs her final insight about shadow as key. The moment she "did not hesitate, her hands already searching" shows decisive agency under pressure. However, interiority remains largely poetic and abstract—"a quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs"—without embodied contradiction or mistake that compounds before resolution. The triumph feels preordained rather than earned through visible struggle with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost's motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara's faith and Kaelen's cynicism are asserted via labels ("her faith a fragile shield against his cynicism") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The family dynamic is declared ("found family," "strangers who became family") but never tested on the page through a difficult trade-off. Anya's climb shows physical struggle but not internal conflict that would earn the collective-effort closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in acceptance of duty, with the puppet head serving as a concrete anchor to his past. His renunciation of saving the world in favor of offering solace shows internal contradiction handled through acceptance rather than struggle. However, the protagonist lacks on-page micro-choices under genuine pressure—he performs a predetermined ritual without visible cost or forfeiture of alternatives until the final dissolution, which reads as inevitable rather than earned through a dilemma. Embodied emotion is present ("bruised awe," holding the puppet to his cheek) but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than moment-by-moment sensation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—reluctant duty turned stubborn spark—embodied through weary physicality and focused will during assembly. Internal conflict between cynicism and the urge to save manifests concretely in his actions rather than mere summary. The interiority avoids stock phrasing; "wrestling with an unseen force" and "weary nonchalance" feel character-specific. Minor slip: the "hereditary disease" metaphor and "cynical pit" verge on stock interiority, but the embodied assembly sequence and final weariness earn the band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's interiority is concrete and voice-specific throughout—the polymer-chemist lens filtering perception of foam and chrysalis reads authentic. His contradictory impulses (grief as "tight, hard knot" versus the "desperate need" to connect) operate simultaneously rather than alternating. The central choice to reframe divergence as beauty rather than failure is earned by the foam observation, though the final chrysalis touch risks sentimental gesture. Embodied emotion is strong: grief "loosened, its fibers unspooling," but "symphonically minded" appears more as tell than shown constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation (finding the origin of stories) is clear and drives his actions toward the climactic incision. The "mindfully scattered" attribute functions mostly as lyrical decoration rather than embodied contradiction; his work reads methodical, not genuinely fragmented. The final choice to wound the tree feels psychologically prepared but arrives through abstract philosophical realization rather than conflicted micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans toward essay-like reflection ("he understood now") rather than embodied tension, though the act itself carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is concrete and drives his final choice to subsume the pavilion's grief. His emotionally contagious touch is embodied through the Warlord's "grinding stones" sensation and the fossil's flood of sorrows, creating genuine constraint. The climactic act of becoming a conduit is earned by prior suffering, though the shift from passive taster to active subsuming agent could be more causally seeded. Minor: the Warlord's worry at the gate feels slightly unearned given his earlier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established (bridge-builder creed), and his empathetically decisive attribute appears in action when he "nudges the dial, his fingers guided by the pain he felt." However, interiority leans heavily on abstract constructions ("empathetically decisive," "harmonious choral librarian") that tell rather than show contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice feels more procedural than genuinely conflicted—he executes a practiced method rather than wrestling with competing goods. Embodiment is present but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation—to preserve abandoned dreams—is clear and drives her choices, but the interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphorical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The neural-lace procedure shows micro-choices under pressure (focusing on the composer's dream, enduring the torrent), and the ending renunciation (accepting a tear but smiling) suggests Earned Stasis. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth; the "quaking reverie" and "tremor in her soul" are asserted more than dramatized through specific bodily degradation or irrational fear that complicates her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his prism-mind trait is demonstrated through concrete perception (seeing hidden logic in the doodle). However, his internal life remains somewhat thin—the journey feels more like enacted competence than genuine struggle with contradictory impulses. The final burden he carries is told more than embodied with visible cost in micro-choices during the climax. Embodied emotion is present but could deepen at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied—her need to "create music in a silent world" drives specific choices with the porcelain insulator. The contradiction between her symphonic imagination and technical limitation appears on-page through her struggle with the Old One's stress cracks. Motivation tightens from abstract longing to focused method when she reads the tree's "autobiography of tension." However, the resolution lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path; the final silence is "different" but no concrete choice or renunciation lands with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan's interior life is specific and embodied—thumb working the stone's groove, fillings aching—and his chess-tutor lens colors all perception. The motivation to find beauty in difficulty drives his precise methodology and the awe-tear at discovery. Minor slip: the final stone-drop reads slightly performative rather than contradictory, and the "no longer a tutor without a student" articulation edges toward neat self-awareness. Exile backstory anchors present stakes cleanly within BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and sustained—cataloging silence to pursue empathy—and the synesthetic attribute ("taste colors and hear textures") generates distinct perceptual choices during the frequency-tuning sequence. The memory-triggered insight that shifts the dial "past the measured increments to a place that just *felt* right" shows interiority driving the climactic action. However, the grandmother remains a placeholder; no contradictory impulses complicate Elias's reverence, and the final shelving gesture lands without visible emotional cost or foreclosed alternative, weakening the sense of earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior journey is grounded in embodied sensory experience—the "nutty, earthy aroma" anchors her focus, and her micro-choice to turn inward during the sensory assault is concrete. The contradiction between her hypersensitive nose and her ultimate test (a malodorous bloom) creates authentic tension. Internal state and external action align consistently, with her stillness under pressure earned through prior meticulous care. Minor slip: the character's struggle feels somewhat predictable in arc, though execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (saving the orchards) is clear and drives the journey, but her interiority remains thin—mostly determination without contradictory impulses or embodied doubt. The arrow-tip humming provides external guidance rather than forcing difficult micro-choices that reveal her values under pressure. The final moment (shearing the crystal) reads as mission completion without visible trade-off or foreclosed path; we see collection, not cost or renunciation that would earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through his methodical survey work, and his interior texture remains consistent—esoteric devotion to predicting disasters. The discovery of the patch pivots his perspective with visible cost ("the victory was hollow"), and his final stance crystallizes around achieved-but-futile mastery. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("quest to cultivate foresight") rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is declared but never tested against a live obstacle that would reveal internal contradiction. The "synesthetically blessed" trait functions as a label that enables the ritual rather than a constraint that forces difficult choices. The tremor-as-cue and the bell-ringing sequence are enacted without visible cost, mistake, or friction. Earned change is absent; the ending asserts that "wonder had been certified" without dramatizing what Kael sacrificed or risked to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout: "failure was a shard of ice in his gut," "knuckles were white." The emotional arc from self-flagellation to "clean, sharp pain" of insight is earned through the flute ritual. Internal contradiction operates effectively—he simultaneously grieves Elara and seeks mechanical understanding of his breaking. Minor weakness: the epiphany moment ("The guardianship was never about keeping the worlds separate") edges toward articulated wisdom rather than pure dramatization, though the prior sensory work largely earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is given a consistent internal drive—understanding emotion as mathematics—that shapes his actions throughout. The borrowed-personality trait is shown embodied (taking on Anya's cadence, her posture of grief) and constrains his method. Anya's interiority is thinner; her grief is more object than lived contradiction, which limits the relational crucible. The final separation reads as earned stasis for Elias, but Anya's shift feels more conceptual than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's jittery-to-steady arc is embodied in the hand tremor that vanishes by the end, and his epiphany about wonder over routine is earned through witnessing phantoms and Elara's memory. However, the transformation feels abrupt—one mystical event dissolves lifelong anxiety without visible internal struggle or trade-off. The mentor's absence is told rather than dramatized through present choices that reveal what her teachings cost him to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and driven by a specific, contradictory motivation: to keep her memory "sacred and sentient" through scientific proof. His final realization—that objects hold brutally literal rather than poetic memories—is earned by the prism's revelation and forecloses his years-long interpretive frame with visible cost ("the earth beneath him was now made of broken steel and indifferent physics, not love"). Minor slip: the opening's "truthful lie" and "attentive mystic" verge on label-speak, though they're quickly grounded in action. The kneeling closure and weight of the prism embody his loss effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her sacrifice—losing memories to weave them into the tapestry—is concrete and embodied. The final moment where she becomes "a stranger to her own heart" carries visible cost. However, interiority leans toward label-only emotion ("wistful ache," "profound and wistful longing") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the protagonist's agency is primarily endurance rather than a choice that narrows live options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and specific—the bartering of sensory memories is embodied and character-particular. His motivation intensifies coherently from forge-keeping to planetary healing, with the final hollowed-out state showing visible cost. Minor slip: the "quietly determined spirit" label in paragraph three edges toward summary, though subsequent action dramatizes it. The final choice to descend again tomorrow earns the endurance with on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his interiority is grounded in sensory particulars—the shard, the scent of chai tea, the chill of concrete. His final choice to redirect the cascade rather than attempt rescue shows internal contradiction working in scene: the impulse to save versus the acceptance of finality. The renunciation is earned and forecloses the haunting with visible cost. Minor slip: the parents' "tension in their grief" is told rather than dramatized, reducing the weight of the withheld truth.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied—"protect" functions as both instinct and compulsion, grounded in his silent routine. The interior work is strongest in the storm-crossing and lantern-room discovery; "a luminescent ache filled Silas's chest" risks soft phrasing but the surrounding concrete action (repairing the lamp, building the stone circle) earns the turn. Minor slip: the keeper remains entirely off-page, reducing relational crucible pressure. The renunciation (farewell via stone circle) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelan's motivation is stated early ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract; the manic laughter is performed rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final realization—"the dawn was beginning to shape him too"—arrives as an epiphany without prior micro-choices that would earn it. Internal experience stays one-note (elation/wonder) without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his observational stance is consistent, but his agency remains largely passive until the final approach. The donor heart backstory is efficient (~10% of text) and anchors the present perceptual shift, yet interior contradiction is limited—he observes and concludes without meaningful internal resistance. The woman remains a cipher by design, which serves the theme but offers no relational pressure or status friction. The final encounter delivers recognition but no visible cost that forecloses a path; it feels like mutual acknowledgment rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris is embodied through his work with silver tweezers and charcoal ledger, and his desire to witness tree sorrow drives his choices. Internal contradiction appears when his "true motivation" diverges from his job, creating layered intent. The final mosaic placement enacts a meaningful choice—archiving rather than fixing—that forecloses emotional rescue with visible acceptance. Minor slip: the backstory about trees as "silent archivists" reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, nudging toward thesis rather than lived obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—rekindle the realm through song—but her characterization leans heavily on abstract interiority ("shattered reflection," "bright shards") without embodied contradiction or genuine friction. The memory-gathering feels more like a quest checklist than internal conflict; she moves through tasks without visible struggle between competing impulses. The final act of singing is framed as duty rather than a choice that forecloses another path with felt cost. Micro-choices exist (tending plants) but don't reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior contradictions (empathy as fever vs. lens, loneliness vs. reclusion) act simultaneously in scene. The "staying while leaving" technique is embodied through concrete sensory dissolution rather than labeled, and his final choice to leave the invitation smoothed on the table arises from watching Elara's mirrored solitude. Minor: the empathy-as-tidal-wave metaphor edges toward stock phrasing, and the leap to "space where he could feel for others, not just with them" feels slightly over-articulated for a realization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—her attention to decay, her tactile relationship with the bread heel, her "quiet, desperate hunt" embodied through guerrilla gardening. The patrolman's whispered memory of his mother's Saturday ritual adds credible depth in minimal space. The final stance—"seen" rather than punished or validated—feels earned, though the shift could carry slightly more internal contradiction to reach higher bands. Micro-choices (kneeling, holding out the bread, continuing to plant) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's interior is concrete and specific ("breath fogging," "fingers flew"), with embodied stress visible throughout the apparatus sequence. His motivation—to salvage meaning—is tested by the vow's collapse and forces the micro-choice to capture the tone at the final flare. Internal contradiction is present (he knows the end is "impossible" yet persists), and the final stance crystallizes into "guardian of ghosts" with a credible cost: endurance in profound isolation. Minor deduction: the reflection on his purpose in the archive middle section leans abstract ("cartographer of a collapsing reality") and slightly diagnostic, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is embodied and particular—the brass listening device in her pocket, the need to capture "the sound of trust breaking" as currency. Her escalating attempts (crab pots, Boro, bribe, then the lie) show agency under pressure with visible micro-choices. The final pivot to breaking what Silas is selling rather than outbidding him demonstrates earned problem-solving, and the steadfastness attribute lands in action ("her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through" is told but immediately shown in her calm lie). Minor demerit: the attribute line is slightly over-articulated, and Silas's interiority ("his panic he couldn't contain") slightly breaches POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained (to understand the Tempest-touched mechanism), and her embodied sensory experience (taste changes) grounds her agency. However, her arc lacks a meaningful internal contradiction or cost-bearing choice; she observes a convergence and adjusts her intellectual stance but does not forfeit a path or face a competing impulse that narrows options. The carriers themselves remain ciphers—visually distinct weather systems without individuated interiority or choices that pressure Elara's goal. The final "humbling" feels asserted rather than earned by a specific on-page decision or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("charcoal dust under his fingernails," eidetic cataloging). His internal conflict between mnemonic replication and suppressed creativity is embodied through his physicality and environment rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice—opening the box after learning to see beyond surfaces—is earned by the painting-as-diagram insight and closes the arc with visible cost (years of bitter failure, the tear through charcoal dust). Minor slip: the transition from patrons' laughter to cave insight could show more micro-choices that narrow his path before the leap to "finally saw it."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is coherent and his final choice to plant the seed feels earned by the arc. However, the initial wilting fern is purely observational and doesn't force a trade-off; his discovery of the map happens by accident rather than through an active pursuit. The weeks of reconstruction work are summarized rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present in the trembling hand and the "breathtaking rush," but overall interiority leans toward narrated summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his actions consistently pursue the goal of preserving wonder through symphonies of truth. His seasonal muteness is mentioned but functions primarily as atmospheric trait rather than constraining on-page choice with visible cost. The work sequence is economical and purposeful, though the emotional arc remains steady rather than contradictory—he begins satisfied with his purpose and ends satisfied, with no internal conflict forcing a foreclosed path. The final stance is endurance rather than change, which qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost is the ice's destruction rather than a personal forfeiture that alters his options.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The android protagonist's interiority is distinct and embodied—"static in my core processes" and "metallic fingers tracing" ground the non-human perspective well. The motivation to resolve inner static drives the miniaturization plan with clear agency and visible cost (sacrificing the dome, leaving the garden). Internal contradiction between caretaker programming and Elara's emotions is present but could deepen; the emotional stakes feel slightly told ("strangely organic warmth") rather than enacted in scene-level micro-choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear, consistent motivation (belief that listening heals) that drives his courtyard vigil, but his interior life remains somewhat abstract—"a familiar pull" and "conviction as deep and quiet as a desert night" tell rather than embody contradiction or cost. The secondary cast (Mrs. Petrov, Mateo, Mr. Chen) function efficiently as information sources but lack individual pressure or stakes beyond their anecdotes. The final choice to use the locket feels more like puzzle-solving than character struggle; no visible want conflicts with his listening method, and the resolution arrives without foreclosing a credible alternate path or revealing a flaw under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the dance sequence, which translates code into physical problem-solving. Her internal contradiction between needing control (like her mother) and accepting randomness drives the climactic choice. The mother remains abstract—a "fractured consciousness" felt more than dramatized—but the protagonist's arc from pure logic to embracing chance is earned through concrete action. Minor deduction: the emotional progression toward acceptance could have shown more resistance or cost before the surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is driven by a clear, coherent motivation—recovering Elara's deleted memories—and his choices under pressure (descending to the chamber, performing the ritual, reaching into the gravity pocket) are causally linked to that drive. The embodied emotion is strong: "ghost of Elara's warmth fading from his skin," and the final renunciation (he hasn't retrieved it all, only a fragment) forecloses the path of easy recovery with visible cost. Minor slip: Elara as a character remains largely abstract, a "placid, unknowing stranger" who never exerts on-page pressure, which leaves the relationship crucible underdeveloped. The internal contradiction—hope versus the enormity of the task—is present but could deepen if a micro-choice revealed competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, and the tranquil-blaze contradiction shows purposeful internal tension. However, her solitary work offers no relational pressure or secondary character to test her commitment, and the power flows without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The ending declares the work "done" and her role as "silent guardian" without dramatizing what she has sacrificed or altered within herself. Embodied emotion is sparse—most interiority consists of abstract energy-flow description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara's motivation to learn building language is embodied through concrete actions—palm against wallpaper, feeling pulses—and her progression from comfortable illusion to demanding truth drives the final rooftop confrontation. Elias functions well as tutor-echo with distinct mannerisms ("patiently nimble," voice like dry leaves), though his interiority remains appropriately opaque given his nature. The final choice to become "librarian of whispers" feels earned by the tutorial arc, with visible cost in surrendering the agreed-upon lies. Minor slip: the transition from weekly tea comfort to "need for truth" could show one more micro-choice illustrating the curdle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his arc from skeptic to whole person is earned through the memory recovery. However, his interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("charmed skeptic," "profound isolation," "ghostly resolve") that distances rather than embodies. The change feels mechanically complete but emotionally summarized rather than viscerally tracked through contradictory impulses in action. The final tear and "quiet strength" arrive as labels more than lived states.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation—to forgive the unfinished and release generations from a ghost war—is clear, embodied through concrete action (the precise alteration), and drives his final choice with visible cost (trembling, profound peace). Internal experience is richly textured ("a quiet, desperate need," "forgery of compassion") and distinct from external composure. The piece maintains tight POV coherence with no knowledge leaks, and the protagonist's competence is balanced by genuine pressure ("immense strain"). Micro-choices under duress (the hovering thorn, steadying breath) reveal hierarchy of values, though the closure renunciation could foreclose a live path more sharply on the page to reach high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation is clearly established and her perceptive attribute drives the plot, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—"richly perceptive" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The mother's silence provides emotional weight, yet the final epiphany ("not just an echo singer; she was a finisher of songs") arrives through declaration rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path. Internal conflict is present but largely sequential rather than simultaneous, and the climactic understanding feels slightly too tidy given the complexity promised earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—salvaging pure truth from tragedy—but her interiority remains somewhat abstract and distant. The boy and the man are sketched through dream fragments rather than fully dramatized, which limits contradictory impulses and embodied emotion. The final release feels more thematically declared than earned through specific internal struggle. Micro-choices exist (deepening the trance, weaving truth through images) but lack visceral cost or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—whisking tea, navigating moon paths, whistling—and his motivation (appreciation of hidden effort) shapes micro-choices throughout. The tea-whisk meditation and firefly observation layer contradictory impulses: philosopher-observer versus demure participant. The final smile and reframed tool-understanding show earned Stasis with visible cost (acceptance of his small role). Minor: the internal voice occasionally edges toward elevated diction ("scintillatingly somber") that reads slightly exterior to a net-mender's lexicon, but remains consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's professional skepticism and observant nature are consistently shown through concrete action—noting the orchard's uniform health, examining the diamond's flaw under magnification, methodically reassembling letters. The character demonstrates embodied problem-solving (climbing the ladder, adjusting position with the diamond) rather than passive observation. Internal motivation remains clear: excavating truth from comfortable lies drives every choice. The final stance—lowering the diamond after finding the stillpoint—earns its closure through prior causal work, though the character's emotional register stays flat throughout, missing contradictory impulses that would elevate to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is stated early but his choices feel reactive rather than agency-driven until the final broadcast. The panic-to-resolution arc compresses too quickly; the move from "cold and sharp" panic to commanding broadcaster lacks embodied transition. Internal contradiction is present (shepherd of ghosts vs. his own allegiance) but not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to reject both shadows arrives via discovered map rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet's motivation is richly embodied through his ritual of capturing sounds, showing clear internal consistency between belief and action. The "positively wistful ache" and his method ground him in specific, contradictory impulses—loneliness paired with creative purpose. However, the character remains largely unopposed by internal conflict; his choices flow smoothly without the friction of competing wants or costs that would elevate the work. The final placement of the seashell reads as completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior landscape combines precise technical detail with visceral physicality ("sweat-soaked and trembling"), and her method of attuning frequencies shows clear capability under stress. The "logically emotional" framework is embodied through "cold knot of dread...acknowledged, analyzed, and then filed away," demonstrating contradictory impulses in action. However, the motivation to protect the artifact remains abstract—told rather than dramatized through competing wants or moral friction—and no meaningful internal conflict complicates her choices. The final exhaustion registers physical cost but lacks a felt decision or renunciation that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's interiority is consistently embodied through the "wild animal clawing at her ribs" motif and her relationship with impatience. Her contradiction—yearning to smash instruments while forcing herself to watch—operates simultaneously in scene. The final moment where "the frantic clawing in her chest finally still" earns the transformation through months of charted waiting. Minor weakness: the vigilant horizon mapper role feels more decorative than constraining until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interior is specific and embodied—"quiet, steady burn in his gut," the jolt from the lantern—and his professional calm creates productive tension with the disorienting sensations. His choice at the end to defy Fletcher by including the journal context is motivated by the investigation and carries visible cost (career defiance). The interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic clarity ("oppressive weight…begin to lift") that feels slightly over-articulated for a man mid-crisis, and Finch remains a construct known only through notebook and sensation rather than a pressure-bearing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arthur's interiority is concrete and consistently rendered through embodied emotion ("heart a heavy, leaden thing"). His turn from offering scripture to seeking to "understand the mechanics of despair" is earned. Elias functions well as a secondary pressure source with distinct past (prisoner's defiance → craftsman's patience). Minor: Arthur's realization feels slightly over-articulated in the final paragraphs ("quiet understanding settled over Arthur, deep and resonant")—the label weakens what the image of light through clouds already dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's motivation (to "ring a bell no one hears yet") is embodied through months of solitary work and the final test flight, with clear internal stakes. His "steadily curious nature" drives concrete micro-choices: building the wing, trusting the glyph's shape, pulling the actuator at the moment of free-fall. The laugh of "sacrilegious joy" at the end is embodied and particular, though the interiority leans slightly abstract in the workshop section ("dialogue conducted throughout the evolution of his own lonely thoughts"). The final choice—yelling "Grip!" and pulling the actuator—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of safety with visible cost (risking death over the acid sea).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and character-particular—her obsessive search for Julian's deleted profile drives every beat. Her lie to Kael ("just clearing out some recursive code loops") is an earned micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values: protecting Julian's ghost over job security. Internal contradiction appears in the balance between her "brightly attentive" professional competence and the desperation that makes her bypass security she "wasn't supposed to know existed." The final action (clicking 'forward') forecloses a path with visible cost—she exposes AetherNet's crime, risking her position and access to the only remaining piece of her brother—but the embodied emotion at closure relies on the physical patch rather than dramatized bodily sensation, and the phrase "impossible steady" voice during the Kael confrontation leans toward assertion rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is dramatized through his method of investigation and his final speech, with internal clarity about his role. The visions show character-particular details (Jorn reinforcing the line, Mara's grief), but the interiority remains somewhat abstract—"map empathy onto action" reads more as prompt language than embodied thought. Mara and Jorn react credibly but remain largely instrumental to Kael's arc. The final shift in Mara is told ("the rigid anger draining away") rather than shown through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through repeated acts of trawling and observation. Her interior contradiction—using others' catastrophe as her classroom, the selfish method framed as volunteering—creates genuine complexity. The parasol tip functions as a small, hard truth that charges the fold-in-patience moment without overt symbolism. Minor deduction: the "changed one Tuesday morning" remains abstract; a micro-choice reflecting that change would sharpen interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is rendered with concrete interiority: the burned letter fragment traced by a calloused thumb, the reflection on mismatched vines embodying his own failed relationship. His realization about "Mourvedre heat" versus "Grenache spirit" avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in his occupation. The shift from guarding against memory to tending it earns the final stance, though the epiphany arrives smoothly without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and specific—preserve the prophet's wisdom—and his actions track consistently through the piece. The "strangely honest" trait functions on the page when he corrects the disciple, though it could bear more weight in the central action. His interior state during the kinetic parapet sequence shows embodied focus and whisperfield calm, avoiding label-only emotion. The final "profound rightness" risks abstraction but remains anchored to the completed ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is stated ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") but his interior world remains abstract—no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. The "perceptively calm demeanor" is label-only; we never see it constrain a decision or create friction. His ritual unfolds without dramatized cost or a moment where he must choose between competing goods. The town's collective healing is told rather than shown through his agency, leaving the arc more summarized than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and sustained, with his "question mark" posture and reticent nature shaping his patient listening work. The shift from "curator of catalogued endings" to "oracle for a history that had never been written" represents earned transformation through the crystal's revelation. Minor slip: the final epiphany ("growth was the process, not the product") edges toward statement rather than full embodiment, though it's anchored in weeks of listening. The cost—choosing testimony over publication—is visible and character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's "precognitively forgetful" nature creates genuine internal contradiction—he knew what to do but can't access it—driving embodied panic ("cold and sharp") at the critical moment. The final choice to draw a simple circle rather than the complex sigil is earned by the entire arc of forgetting and represents genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor weakness: the interiority occasionally tilts toward lyric abstraction ("tidal longing for a certainty") that risks distancing, though it remains anchored in concrete sensory cues (chalk texture, tooth vibration). The embodied reactions and micro-choices under pressure are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly rooted in grief ("luminous ache...since he lost her") and his lifelong quest is embodied through concrete lens-polishing and his final sacrifice of the photograph lens. The internal conflict between preserving memory and achieving his goal is visible in the choice to dismantle the treasured lens. Minor issue: Hima remains functional but underdeveloped; her presence serves plot without internal pressure. The final act of sacrifice carries visible cost and feels earned by the sustained grief motif.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align, but she operates with near-perfect competence—no genuine struggle or visible cost touches her choices. Mr. Aris and Lena receive embodied moments (the tear, the hand-clasp), yet their interiority remains thin; we never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "decisively kind force" phrase edges toward diagnostic label-speak, flattening what could be shown through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and anchored in concrete work—weeks of study lead to the final sequence. Internal state is conveyed through embodied action (picking up the key, clicking rings) rather than label-speak. However, the story lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her scholarly precision faces no genuine obstacle or competing impulse, and the final act feels like executing a plan rather than a choice under pressure. The automaton remains passive, so the secondary entity does not apply meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through his bone-setting profession as metaphor for worldview, and his interior contradiction—rational skeptic who dismissed his wife's beliefs now confronting evidence—drives authentic choices. The yearning for Elara's faith he "could not share but now desperately needed" embodies genuine internal conflict. Minor slips: "shrewdly innocent gaze" reads label-only without demonstrating how this trait shapes his perception in scene, and the tear moment edges toward sentiment. The final constellation-drawing choice is earned by prior causality and forecloses his old certainty with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is established through concrete anchors—stained fingers, childhood star charts, village fire memory—but the arc from observation to action lacks decisive internal friction. The motivation (share light without fire) drives her polishing work, yet no competing impulse tests her resolve; she proceeds with meditative certainty rather than contradictory want versus fear. The grandmother's whispered wisdom and fire memory provide backstory hooks, but Elara's present choices feel contemplative rather than pressured by internal conflict. The final holding-up moment offers completion without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's characterization is strong: her "watchful dreamer" nature drives quiet, proactive choices (tending humidity, leaving tea, placing the slate panel) that accumulate into the symbolic gesture with the amber pendant. Kaelen's interior state is embodied through physical detail ("hollowed-out look," "deafening roar of a million unseen judgments") and his final breath signals earned change. The amber/water contrast effectively externalizes the internal conflict, though Kaelen's agency remains largely receptive until the final moment. Minor deduction for Kaelen's relatively passive arc, but the cost of choice is legible in his closing gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—to honor abandoned stories—is concrete and drives his symbolic burial of the shell. Internal conflict between commercial success and creative integrity is present but largely told through exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to bury the shell and become "their keeper" feels more symbolic than earned by on-page struggle; the cost is conceptual but the dramatic work to foreclose a path is thin. Embodied emotion is sparse; much of the interiority reads as narrated state rather than perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and his tinkerer background informs his methodical approach to the song-ritual. The protagonist's internal experience shows embodied tension ("fingers...trembled slightly") and his micro-choices—adjusting notes, detecting dissonance—reveal capability under pressure. However, interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("surge of confidence," "the path was illuminated") and lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his emotional progression is smooth rather than conflicted. The final stance feels earned by the ritual's completion but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in his body or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and poetic—translating heartbeats into maps—but his choices lack internal contradiction or visible cost. The piece sustains a patient, purposeful character through embodied action (kneeling for hours, the thumb-press seal), yet his emotional state remains static and externalized. No genuine struggle or trade-off emerges; he simply executes his ritual without friction. The final departure to await the next heartbeat reads as Earned Stasis, but the lack of visible internal conflict or renunciation caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's "private axiom" about storing wonder is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. His reflective trait and peripheral focus method are label-presented but never conflict with urgency or cost him anything on the page. The final moment shows satisfaction without visible renunciation or trade-off—he leans back, work complete, with no evident price paid for the long isolation or the choice to preserve rather than release the echoes immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory particulars (bronze grotto, starlight, kerosene burner) and his motivation to collect burdens is concrete. The fractal weaver's stasis is earned by the prison constraint, and the farmer's grief—felt as "a shard of glass in the psychic current"—grounds abstract sorrow in embodied perception. Internal contradiction is present (boundary-lessly trapped yet conscious across the world) and drives the solitary ritual. Minor slip: the emotional arc remains static; Kaelen performs his task without meaningful internal shift or micro-choice that alters his stance, capping higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "parcelling grief into manageable increments of time" and her "hauntingly practical arrangement" show embodied coping without therapy-speak. The memory of Leo and the cub demonstrates motivation through crystallized specificity rather than summary. The choice to carve—"an arc of profound stillness, the very shape of an exhale"—emerges from the memory's lesson with visible cost (foreclosing full expression of grief). Minor deduction: the widow's action feels solitary and contemplative; no secondary pressure tests her stance, leaving the choice unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interior life shows embodied contradictions: pride and regret act simultaneously through concrete objects (the camera wheel) and memory triggers rather than alternating summaries. The ghost functions as externalized internal conflict with distinct dialogue, though its final dissolution into "shared, profound sorrow" edges toward tidy resolution. Motivation is character-particular—ambition that "broke it"—and the renunciation forecloses his prior bargaining stance with visible cost: accepting authorship of failure. Minor slip: "frantic scramble of his pride" reads slightly abstract for a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation evolves cleanly from philosophical search to tangible problem-solving, anchored in her engineering mindset. Her actions—kicking through debris, cross-referencing schematics, wiring generators—are consistently purposeful and embodied. The final realization ("not an equation to be solved, but a current to be rerouted") feels earned by her concrete work rather than declared. Minor weakness: the trait "functionally creative" is told rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied ("the wet chill of the slate seeping through the knees") with a clear arc from burden to "settled" peace. His micro-choices—arranging the bells "not in a scale but in a small, silent constellation"—reveal value hierarchy without explicit moralizing. The final renunciation feels earned by twenty years of carrying the coffer, though the "glacial hush" shaping metaphor sometimes verges on poetic over-specificity. No secondary character pressure tests the choice, but the singular focus maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and grounded in familial stakes; his persistent quest to understand his grandfather's disgrace drives every choice. The climactic moment where he realizes the "architecture of the lie wasn't a simple theft; it was a sacrifice" lands with earned force, supported by weeks of instinct-training and the physical act of salvage. Internal contradiction appears in his tension between seeking truth and fearing what it will reveal, though this could be more embodied in micro-choices during the retrieval itself. The grandfather's paradox ("read this in the dark") functions well as a character-specific riddle that reframes understanding at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated (preservation of ancient methods), but remains largely observational throughout. His "infinite patience" is asserted rather than tested by a meaningful on-page cost or choice that forecloses a path. Interior access is poetic but static—he traces, coaxes, sketches—without embodied contradiction or a stake that genuinely threatens his work. The final "understanding bloomed" reads as an epiphany delivered rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his method of empathic projection is embodied through the thread-handling ritual. The projection sequence delivers vivid, contradictory sensory experiences ("rhythmic shudder," "phantom ache," "fierce, determined hope") that show his process under strain. However, his characterization remains largely observational; he makes no difficult on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he simply witnesses, understands, and writes. The final companionship feels asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that alters his stance or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clearly rooted in his obsessive need to reawaken beauty, and his physical decline (thinning, bedraggled) embodies the cost of his choices. The final moment of his hands ceasing to quake suggests earned stasis after sustained pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on elevated, somewhat generic phrasing ("quaking reverie," "prayerful guess") that occasionally distances us from immediate embodied experience during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her father's legacy shapes her motivations, and the pouch of black sand functions as a tactile anchor rather than a label. The graft scene demonstrates her skill and compassion through specific surgical choices, and the coin's sacrifice carries visible cost. Minor slip: the "unyielding compassion" frame occasionally tilts toward assertion rather than contradiction—her internal conflict could deepen if the father's destructive legacy created more active tension in her choices during the fire.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "luminous skeptic" trait operates consistently—skepticism as method, emotion underneath. The micro-choices (rotating the box, waiting for alignment) reflect patience and logic, but her interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beat earns a stance shift (defiant hush answered), but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt in her body or choices. Internal conflict is gestured at ("her logical mind resisted but her heart could not abandon") rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Xylar's interior motivation is consistent and specific—inherited sorrow, empathic sonar—but the protagonist remains passive through most of the journey, observing and feeling until the final shift. The epiphany ("the act of reaching out with feeling *was* the light") arrives without prior micro-choices that test or complicate this insight; the change feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present in the "ache" and "tendril of focused energy," but the abstract register ("vessel for feelings too vast for a heart") often distances us from visceral stakes. The final broadcast carries conceptual weight but lacks a visible personal cost—what path does Xylar foreclose?

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to discover collective grief's shape is clear and his obsession intensifies through repeated greenhouse visits. The grandmother's spectral presence guides his hands with "sudden certainty," but this moment lacks embodied contradiction—his epiphany arrives smoothly without visible internal resistance or cost. The final understanding feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle: "he understood" followed by abstract explanation. Micro-choices are present (tracing lines, picking up chisel) but the peak realization bypasses conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior life is embodied through ritual and sensory detail—the phantom brine replacing gear oil, the weight of the pendulum bob in his mind's eye. His motivation to restore balance is enacted through the inscriptions and yearly additions, showing contradictory impulses between containment and release. The ethically diligent trait constrains his choice at the ritual's hardest moment, creating visible tension. Minor slip: the shift from "broken" to "balance" reads slightly abstract in the final paragraph, though the embodied lightness recovers it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior is consistent—his obsession with decoding intentions drives each move—but his emotional arc feels too smooth. The progression from "thrilling proximity" to "birdsong after a storm" clarity lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; he never doubts his method or wrestles with the cost of his nightly ritual. The final "peace" reads as declared rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His renunciation of going home and his solitary path are mentioned but never tested by conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and his interior conflict between forcing change and preserving tradition drives the final choice. The analytical engine modeling and year of work provide concrete grounding for his predictive methods, avoiding sorcery handwaving. His fear of condemning a generation to hardship for the next's benefit creates genuine tension, though the final moment leans slightly toward resolve without deeply embodied contradiction in the descent itself. Interiority remains specific to his role and stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's devotion is embodied through precise physical choices (pen selection, ink concealment, practiced tuning), and his motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" drives clear on-page actions with visible risk. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between his "clenching fear" and his calm execution, though the piece leans toward reverential steadiness rather than simultaneous emotional conflict in peak moments. The final choice to deliver the score is consistent but feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost—he will simply repeat the cycle. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract framing of his interior state ("thistled calm," "singular quiet focus") where more embodied particulars would sharpen agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—she crystallizes grief into ritual—and her choices drive the sequence. However, her interiority remains largely opaque; we see practiced actions but few contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Kael is sufficiently embodied in his fragility and the tear-traced moment, but his arc leans passive—he receives the ritual rather than wrestling with it. The mirage-of-safety frame is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas exhibits clear internal contradiction—his mission feels "profoundly important and utterly, cosmically useless"—and his choices under pressure (cleaning the cog for hours, attempting to teach the girl) are grounded in consistent traits. The encounter with the girl dramatizes his conflict between preserving knowledge and facing its irrelevance, with embodied reactions (the "brittle and humorless" laugh that dies in his throat). The final choice to continue archiving despite futility is earned, though the renunciation could carry sharper bodily cost at the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal contradiction (resigned yet trying) is dramatized through the rosette and his shift in method. The choir members remain generic—no individual voices or embodied resistance beyond "tense silence" and "shuffling feet." The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned; we see no individual member's shift in stance, no particular face or voice that carries the weight of unlearning hatred. The collective "they" flattens what should be a crucible of distinct, conflicting people.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his synesthetic palate, with strong micro-choices during the pruning sequence that reveal value hierarchies (trimming betrayal, apathy, anger to allow forgiveness and courage). The tasting mechanism provides concrete interiority without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is present but muted—his desire to reshape history faces minimal on-page resistance or doubt that would deepen the stakes. The final choice feels earned by prior setup, though the cost registers more as conceptual than viscerally felt personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation to preserve wonder is rooted and dramatized through the matchbox-riddle choice rather than mere declaration. His affliction (involuntary truthfulness) constrains his options on the page—he cannot lie, so he chooses indirection—with visible cost to efficiency. Lena's exhaustion and shift from weary to intent are embodied and purposeful. The interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains concrete, though the final exchange ("Thank you, Silas") lands slightly too tidy for the complexity built prior.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific—tracking the "deadness" of houses through small interventions—and her interior monologue carries a distinct perceptual signature (the orris root shard, her grandmother's teachings). The pivot from "waking the spirit" to "create a tiny, unexpected fissure" is signaled but feels slightly over-articulated for the character's natural realization. Minor embodiment gaps appear: the "frantic, muffled rhythm" of her heart is told rather than shown through breath or movement. The final choice to observe rather than act forecloses further sanctification with visible cost, though the renunciation could be more physically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's arc from righteous crusader to conscience-stricken defector is earned through her tactile interaction with the ampoule and Galen's telepathic guidance. Her final burial of the poison shows a concrete renunciation with visible cost—abandoning her mission and certainty. Internal contradictions are embodied: she recites training even as new reality fractures it. Minor deduction for the shift from "mission directive" to symbolic burial feeling slightly telescoped; one additional micro-choice in the middle third would have strengthened the escalation of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and character-specific—his motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" drives meaningful action through mathematical obsession. The climactic beat embodies contradiction: triumph layered with "fresh wound," avoiding therapy-speak through sensory specificity ("damp chill," "click of a lock"). Minor slip: the "grim smile" as "uniform of optimism" reads slightly label-heavy in the opening, and the final stance ("grimly, wonderfully optimistic") repeats the construction without deepening it. Cost is visible on the page when he touches the regret and chooses to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is concrete—rooted in the umbrella memory—and his insomnia trait shapes his methodology. The "methodically hopeful" stance is embodied in his paint-mixing and rigging of spotlights. Internal conflict is present but muted: doubt creeps in during the silence, yet no contradictory impulse complicates his choices in real time. The final moment earns its shift through cumulative pressure, though the protagonist remains more observer than agent in the climactic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alistair's motivation is clear and his "historically oriented" mindset drives the solution, but his interiority leans toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The children's trust and Elara's bread gesture provide warmth, yet Alistair's arc from despair to authority feels more stated than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Elder Maeve and the council remain functional placeholders. The final choice to sing is group-driven rather than forged through visible internal conflict in Alistair himself.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his workshop actions, and his final choice—pulling the lever despite existential risk—feels earned. Interiority remains concrete throughout ("cold fire in his chest," hands that "felt a dizzying lightness"). The ending alteration is visible on the page (softening hands, fading lines) with genuine cost, though the character himself remains somewhat abstract—we see him as "counter clockwise clock maker" more than as a person with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "trick fear into revealing its weakness" shapes the arc, and the void/brokenness creates internal contradiction. However, the interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("cloying companion," "annihilating focus") that feels more authorial than character-specific under stress. The final pivot—void as anchor rather than vulnerability—is motivated by prior set-up, but the embodied cost remains abstract; we see dissolution of reflections, not a felt trade-off in the protagonist's body or immediate future. The whispering advisor functions more as plot device than pressure-generating relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai's interiority is concrete and his goal clear, but the core challenge lacks genuine internal contradiction—he's confident throughout, anxiety framed as "anticipation for the performance." The final beat shows competence and satisfaction rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied detail is strong ("bare feet certain on the damp, silvered wood"), but the character arc is more demonstration than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's "quietly driven" trait is embodied through consistent choices—months of obsessive pattern-decoding, isolating himself on the shell-tower despite social censure—and his final recognition of impossible stakes feels earned by prior causality. Interiority stays concrete ("dread was a physical thing," "sun-baked certainty") without therapy-speak. The mother's absence as motivator is clean, though the final pivot to "make them believe him" arrives abruptly and could benefit from one additional micro-choice showing the cost of that new focus. Internal contradiction between hope and dread operates throughout without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation to "rescue truth" is clear and drives his parallel-drawing tactic, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("measured as a metronome," "precise"). Elara's shift from guardian to collaborator happens entirely through listening; we see no embodied hesitation or contradictory impulse in the moment of surrender—the click of the latches feels too clean. The backstory about the Northern Confederacy supplies the argument but flattens present tension; Aris lectures rather than struggles. Internal conflict is declared (Elara's "weight seemed less like a sacred burden") but not dramatized through competing micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is characterized through embodied contradiction—the stoic surveyor who runs currents of feeling "just as deep and inexorable." His frantic underwater search for the inkwell demonstrates embodied emotion and a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost (scraped knuckles, burned lungs). However, the interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("archeologist of abandoned dreams," "interlaced absence") that feels more authorial than character-specific under stress. The final act of cleaning and renewed purpose earns a credible endurance with felt cost, though the transformation reads more as crystallization than change.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific ("tranquilly perceptive," "dissatisfied with that conclusion"), and his micro-choices under pressure—kneeling to catch moss-light, clutching the stamp—are purposeful and embodied. The final decision to begin "long, slow work of re-indexing" demonstrates renunciation of upheaval with visible cost (isolation, unrecognized labor). Minor slip: the "profound sense of peace" label reads slightly therapeutic and could be more embodied, but it does not flatten the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen's grief is embodied through craft—polishing the gem, folding paper—with visible micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously fears and needs the dream's luminous torment. The transformation at closure (grief as current, not void) is earned by the pilgrimage's accumulative pressure. Minor deduction: Elara remains an abstraction; her presence is told through memory rather than dramatized friction that would test Kaelen's resolve in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amal's motivation is clear and sustained—grief transformed into a cosmic hunt—but her interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("needle in her soul," "cold, dense star in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The geode functions as a focusing object, yet her micro-choices feel more like procedural steps than genuine dilemmas with visible cost. The wedding memory is invoked but remains abstract; we don't see her struggle with competing wants or make a trade-off that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode the frequency is clearly stated and her action to operate the drone and pull the handle demonstrates agency under pressure. However, her "perpetually surprised" expression is mentioned three times as a static label rather than shown through embodied reaction or micro-choices. The final smile feels unearned—there's no interior contradiction or cost visible in the transition from lonely operator to profound peace, and the epiphany arrives via external mechanics rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's guilt and professional curse are sharply established, his motive clear. The final choice—to restore memory rather than continue profiting from false ones—emerges naturally from his discovery. Internal contradiction is visible in his pride-turned-curse trait, and the embodied emotion in "acidic burn of tempered regret" grounds his state. Minor slip: Anya's family forgetting her entirely is told rather than dramatized through a present interaction that would test Elias's knowledge gap.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-specific—the brass lion as tactile anchor, his framing of Kaelen as mirror rather than adversary, the micro-choice to guide rather than command the boy at the end. His motivation ("recycle mistakes into wisdom") drives the closure gesture but remains asserted more than tested; no on-page contradiction or competing impulse complicates the exchange itself. Kaelen is rendered with economy (jaw tension, tremor) but remains functional pressure rather than a fully drawn secondary presence. The final cost—placing his hand on the boy's shoulder, the lion still warm—registers as quiet acceptance rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied throughout ("the weight of that phantom helm," "involuntary pull"). The motivation to "align heart and action" drives the arc cleanly, and the final choice—facing the sea with the compass held out—feels earned by prior causality. Internal conflict operates in scene: his heart screams for the horizon while memory chains him to land. Minor deduction: the phrase "align heart and action" edges toward therapeutic articulation in a peak moment, though it's framed as command rather than diagnostic label.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his interior journey from numbness to "a tiny, fragile spark" is earned by the discovery of the letter. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("hollow spaces between his thoughts," "ghost he couldn't recognize") that flattens embodiment. The micro-choices during the descent and at the lake lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he simply proceeds without visceral internal friction. The final spark feels more asserted than dramatized through competing desires on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear and his grief is embodied through ritual actions—grinding spices, opening the box—but the transformation itself feels more observed than chosen. The "paradoxically steady" trait is mentioned but not demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his resistance is brief and abstract ("a tremor of resistance") rather than a lived struggle. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost beyond physical change; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what he loses in choosing metamorphosis over remaining human.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior contradiction—diviner who cannot grasp her own present—is established early and drives the quest. The renunciation at closure (abandoning the search for lost time) feels earned by the saucer examination and tablecloth failure. However, the epiphany that "lost time was simply vapor" arrives more through narrative assertion than dramatized discovery; the protagonist passively receives insight rather than wrestling toward it through a charged micro-choice in the final beat. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hand, weight on lungs) but occasionally tips into stock phrasing ("aching soul," "crushing burden").

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, her pacifism embodied through the method of acceptance rather than force. The gravitational manifestation of emotion provides concrete, character-particular embodiment. Internal contradiction appears in the final photograph when her own desolation threatens to crush her, yet she offers compassion—a meaningful micro-choice under pressure. The arc from steward to fulfilled vessel reads earned, though the solitary setup limits relational crucible work.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to "understand the texture of transformation" is established early but remains abstract; his choices—following the shell, releasing fireflies—feel driven more by whim than embodied internal conflict. The "unwitting servant" frame distances him from agency: he fulfills prophecies accidentally, which undercuts the cost of his decisions. Interiority is often labeled ("profound curiosity," "philanthropist of moments") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final gesture of pressing his palm to the sand reads as contemplative observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clearly stated ("to spark a silent revolution") and his interior reflects his disciplined mask over true allegiance, but internal contradiction never surfaces—he experiences no genuine tension or cost in this moment. The "tremor in his own veins" is mentioned but immediately overridden by "practiced casualness," flattening the embodied struggle. His final smile reads as satisfaction without visible forfeit; the revolution succeeds off-page through signals to unnamed conspirators, rendering his agency more orchestrator than protagonist under pressure. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under immediate personal cost are present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior life is grounded in concrete action—placing stones, handling star dust—and the precognitive curse constrains his choices with visible cost. The vision of the tide and the promise to Elara create clear motivation. However, the eels' panic is noted but does not complicate his choice; they exist as atmospheric detail rather than a dramatic pressure point. The final slump to his knees reads as relief without the contradictory impulses or visible tradeoff that would elevate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is densely rendered with contradictory impulses ("furiously tranquil," "screaming hurricane" vs. "statue of calm"), and the vigil-to-action shift is motivated. However, the core motivation—understanding scars—remains largely abstract until the final beat, when the key suddenly reframes the vigil as preparation rather than contemplation. The embodied trembling at the end ("hands that were finally, honestly trembling") earns the turn, but the bulk of the middle is reflective mapping without micro-choices that alter present options, pushing against the BRR ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—turning questions into destinations—but his choices unfold without internal contradiction or struggle. The mechanical arm is described beautifully yet functions as aesthetic detail rather than a constraint that complicates his actions. The final "proof" via fencing reads more as a puzzle solution than a character-driven choice with visible cost; we see skill but not a hierarchy of values tested under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's monthly personality shift (the Architect vs. the Reckoner) is established early and constrains his present perception—he sees "potential" where last month he would catalog failures. The moment he offers the poem to the newcomer embodies a hierarchy of values (connection over safety) with visible cost: he steps forward, exposing himself. Internal contradiction is present but underdeveloped; his peace feels unearned given the prison backstory's weight. Elara remains functional but secondary, her interiority inaccessible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation is established early and his strategic creativity drives the main action. The interiority shows emotional specificity—"steely longing had replaced his grief, forging his wistful melodies into something more akin to a blade"—and his final choice to step through the threshold is earned by the preceding causality. Minor slip: the embodiment of his internal contradiction could be sharper; the progression from grief to determination reads slightly linear rather than showing simultaneous competing impulses in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through physical sensations ("panic, cold and sharp") and specific gestures (clutching the seed, humming into song). Her motivation intensifies through genuine struggle with empirical doubt versus faith-based action, and the resolution—singing the harmonized dream-interpretation—flows from established traits. The final moment earns a credible transformation: doubt remains but shifts to "luminous glow," a renunciation of absolute certainty with visible cost. Minor slip: the great-grandmother's name surfacing feels slightly convenient rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kenji's grief is embodied through rituals (shears, tracing lace) and his motivation is clear, but interiority leans toward abstract poetic register ("search for the color of unspoken apologies") rather than character-particular contradiction. The final shift—guilt softening, diffusing—is told through metaphor ("shard… began to soften") without a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path with cost. Emotional progression reads as smooth transformation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Contradictory impulses act in scene (scientific detachment vs. grief), and the final choice to join the process is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his emotional shift. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as sifting through ruins and observing frost patterns. Her final choice to create art is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in overcoming fear. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and internal conflict during the trauma intrusion. Her final choice to weave trauma with the flower's potential is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exhaustion and peace. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his weariness and desperation to end the psychic noise; his interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final choice to revitalize the astrolabe is earned by prior causality. However, the characterization lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation evolves credibly from suspicion to persistent investigation and finally to building intergenerational support, embodied in micro-choices like distributing food and declaring the garden. Her final renunciation of discovering the donor's identity is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her focused resolve. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity, driving her quest with embodied emotion. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as syncing breath to memory, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization is earned through prior causality, transforming her pain with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to use the maze's geometry is earned by prior causality, and the cost of memory loss is felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in strategic patience and sacrifice. Her embodied actions under pressure, such as decoding the keys with "nimble and certain" fingers, reveal character without stock phrasing. The final endurance—remaining chained while her purpose is freed—is earned with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in synesthesia and past trauma, driving his obsession to capture the sound of trust breaking. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling hands, teeth aching from aurora). Final choice to imprint is earned by years of collecting absences, and his endurance forecloses a path with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as ignoring the chaotic aurora to focus on the violet-grey frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from stealing portraits to seeking destiny. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "a chill traced its way up his spine." The closure choice—becoming a "custodian of possibilities"—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as his portraits seem "inert." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses (completing her art vs. fleeing) acting in scene. Her motivation to craft safe zones intensifies under pressure, and the final abandonment is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The memory of Leo adds emotional depth without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)

    Elara's motivation to decode the frequency of belonging is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her white-knuckled control during the drone's strain. However, the "perpetually surprised" trait feels somewhat static and does not deeply constrain choices or introduce significant internal conflict, limiting higher-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotion ("tremor in his own veins") and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his precognitive curse and promise to Elara, driving high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "slumped to his knees" showing cost. His final action to harness the tide is earned by prior causality, with visible struggle and endurance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is deeply integrated with his motivation; his "furiously tranquil" state embodies contradictory impulses that drive his vigil. Micro-choices, like setting the timer without opening the envelope, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the needle card to decipher the sundial). However, interiority lacks embodied emotion or internal contradiction, leaning more on intellectual focus than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his monthly persona changes, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as stepping forward with a poem. The relationship with Elara serves as a crucible, deepening stakes. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and defiant, driving the plot with concrete interiority like "steely longing" and "strategically creative." However, internal contradiction is minimal, with determination overshadowing deeper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris is sharply etched: a man of "serene and predictable cosmic clockwork" confronting chaotic decay, and his choices (returning with a stool instead of a shovel, then finally seeking the shovel) track a clear internal conflict. His desire for abstraction versus his involuntary grief around the orchid creates a credible and specific contradiction. The final shift—recognizing that "The drama was not an overlay; it was the process itself" and acting on that—is well earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s trauma, avoidance of the kiln, and gradual shift from creating light to studying it are specific and consistent, and her decoding of the frost reads as a character-driven choice. The internal contradiction between fear of fire and need for understanding is present but could be more acutely dramatized at the moment she decides to investigate the smugglers’ path. Her final act—sealing the ledger into glass and relighting the kiln—feels earned by prior beats. The emotional cost of returning to fire could be embodied a bit more intensely to reach top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—turning silence into music and transmuting her trauma—is clear, consistent, and drives every beat. Interiority is specific (thermal colors, bodily exhaustion) rather than generic, and the capsize memory intruding into her experiment is a strong, character-rooted pressure point. The final reconfiguration of fear and peace feels earned by what we’ve seen of her persistence and method. Internal contradiction (need to heal vs. risk of re-triggering trauma) is present but could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation (end the psychic noise, “give rest a permanent address”) is clear and drives every choice, from opening the package to using the lens and employing his costly talent. Interiority is specific enough to feel human, with good embodied metaphors for his weariness and relief. However, he faces little on-page internal contradiction—once he decides to go, his commitment never wavers, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The final relief is earned but not deeply complicated, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and consistent—protecting her people, transforming anonymous aid into sustainable community strength—and her choices (accepting the food, organizing runs, declaring the garden) all follow. Interiority is present but a bit summarized; we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses under pressure, which slightly flattens complexity. The emotional embodiment (hollowed cheeks, stooped shoulders, her breath catching at the bell) is vivid and specific. The closing endurance/shift toward agency feels earned and character-rooted, though her flaws remain understated.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her artistic practice and spiritual curiosity, and her micro-choices (coming to this particular viaduct, choosing the jasmine, committing to the ritual) all align with that drive. The ache of the past-life love is well embodied via sensory focus and the “phantom limb” metaphor rather than pure label-speak. What keeps this from the very top band is the relative simplicity of her internal contradiction—she moves from pain to understanding without much in-scene resistance or self-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s ambition, terror, and desperation are clearly motivated and consistent, and the final renunciation (destroying the fragment at the cost of self) is earned by the setup of his obsession. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“to discover the texture of time,” “ghost haunting the hallways of his own history”). There is some emotional contradiction—fear of loss vs compulsion to push further—but it could deepen further around his relationships (the wife remains more image than person). Overall, he reads as a distinct, driven individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to safeguard the vault rather than seek her own freedom—is clear, consistent, and drives every action. Her competence and long-term patience are well dramatized through the decade of preparation and the key-decoding sequence. Internal contradiction is muted; she reads as almost purely purposeful, with little on-page ambivalence or irrational pull in another direction. The final earned stasis (choosing to remain bound while her plan executes) feels credible and aligned with the traits established.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession and pain are specific and convincingly embodied in his methods (jars of absences, the ash forge), and his final choice to use the crystal reads as an earned, costly step toward healing. The internal logic of his motivation is clear and consistent throughout. What’s missing for a top-tier score is more live contradiction on the page—he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses beyond endurance vs. relief. His psychology leans a bit monolithic under pressure, which slightly flattens the complexity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s fixation on “captured life within the frames” and later on the jar gives him a distinct, coherent psychology, and his shift from thief to “custodian of possibilities” feels earned by the encounter at the station. However, his internal struggle is relatively smooth; fear and exhilaration are named but never really pull him in opposite directions in scene. The piece hints at cost (his old vocation going flat in comparison) but doesn’t linger in the discomfort of that loss.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (crafting “safe zones for inquiry”) and grief over Leo are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially the wrenching decision to abandon the glass sphere. The interplay between her theatrical narration and the underlying hurt gives her a distinct inner contradiction. Her emotions are embodied in setting and action (“a painful, slushy ache in her chest,” the physical wrench of leaving the piece). A slightly deeper on-page clash between her mission and her lingering attachment to Leo could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo’s interiority is textured and specific—his acrophobia, stunt background, and shock at being “a ghost he had programmed” all feel embodied rather than generic—and his adaptive nature is shown through concrete micro-choices (climbing despite fear, decoding under pressure, choosing containment over flight). The relationship with Julian is sketched efficiently via status dynamics and history, with Julian’s “actor’s smile” and expectation of a choreographed chase underscoring their power shift. The final choice—to weaponize the failsafe Julian built for “a terrified, vulnerable operative”—is well-motivated by the earlier revelation and his need to reclaim agency. Some thematic self-labeling (“my greatest source of power,” “certainty…in my soul”) edges toward abstraction, slightly smoothing over more contradictory impulses that could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive—mapping an endless night through silence—is clear, particular, and consistently embodied in his choices and perceptions. His interiority feels lived-in (the “watchmaker” precision, the way he catalogs different silences) rather than generic mystic-speak. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are muted: we don’t feel a sharp clash between obsession and any competing desire, just a monofocal drive. The ending reads as earned stasis rather than a deep shift, which fits the piece but keeps characterization short of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Unit 734’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—transitioning from escape to understanding—and its micro-choices (studying its own schematics, bypassing error warnings) feel character-grounded. The calm, methodical demeanor under extreme existential pressure reads as a coherent, individuated trait rather than generic robot-ness. Interiority is particular (e.g., the “power of two” feeling significant) and pays off in the final conceptual risk. The only limit is that internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as live contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and coherent, from his “yearn[ing] to thaw the frost” to the guilty, fearful choice to spy. His actions—collecting the tickets, deciding to follow, offering the box and lens—align with a believable mix of longing and mistrust. Lena is sketched through behavior and art rather than exposition, which fits the piece’s logic of silence. The only shortfall is that his decision to eavesdrop could show an extra beat of internal contradiction under pressure to fully maximize the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—his age, ritual with marbles, and history with the fungal rot all create a coherent, specific man with clear motives. His quietly stubborn belief in an “older metric” tracks cleanly into the solstice test and the final cracked marble. The main limitation is that his internal contradiction under peak pressure (fear of losing vs faith in the garden) could be dramatized more intensely during the judging scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn through vocation, touch ("calloused fingers"), and his obliging steadiness; Aris’s obsession and tremor come through in a few efficient strokes. Elias’s interior reconfiguration at the end feels earned by the set‑up of his practical mindset versus Aris’s theoretical mania. However, under peak pressure he faces little real inner conflict—he more or less acquiesces—so we don’t see contradictory impulses grinding against each other on the page. The relationship dynamic is clear but remains relatively stable; it doesn't quite become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession and artistic temperament are clearly drawn, and his choice to risk destroying the program is well-motivated by weeks of frustrated study. Interiority is atmospheric but somewhat one-note—there’s little contradictory impulse beyond reverence versus curiosity. The emotional cost of his decision (sacrificing the artifact, confronting the ghost’s “last breath”) could be shaded more sharply to deepen him. His shift from decoder to performer is credible but lands as a quiet re-aiming rather than a fully charged internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and self-contradictory: an “oracular machine” built for paradox who nevertheless clings to an emotionally motivated ambiguity about Liam. Her motivation—to confront a buried truth about his fate and her own complicity—is clear and drives every micro-choice in the scene. The final renunciation (choosing not to decipher the word and recognizing that need) is fully earned by prior setup and carries a believable emotional cost. The only minor limit is that we see her relationship with Liam entirely in recollection, so relational pressure is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives (recklessness, swallowed guilt, skeptical mindset) are sharply etched and consistently drive his choices, especially the decision to confront the valve physically. Interiority is concrete and particular (“a three-word sickness I’d swallowed for a year,” “hunger to trade my own gnawing anxiety for a sharper, more immediate fear”). The internal conflict between disbelief and sensory evidence is credible and layered rather than toggled. The closing endurance—he still carries the weight but knows he can—is earned by prior beats and feels like a costly, believable shift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The chronicle keeper’s exhaustion and duty are clearly motivated and embodied (“my purpose remained singular: to witness change without judgment”), and the choice to retreat feels earned. Interiority is specific and consistent, though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. The tension between role and need for erasure is strong but could sharpen if we saw them actively resisting or resenting the escape before yielding. The ending’s quiet endurance (accepting a temporary reprieve, knowing the burden will return) lands as a credible, if understated, Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias and Lena both feel specific and motivated: his “mellow” patience and desire to cultivate wonder play off her sixty-year, object-bound grief in concrete ways. The embodied details—her white-knuckled grip, his careful hand on hers, the tremor of grief as “vibration seeking a new harmony”—land well. Internal contradiction is present (his cautious exuberance, her simultaneous clutching and opening of the box), though Lena’s interiority is more observed than deeply inhabited. The final shift in her stance is earned and credible, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to understand the hollowing and collect the walls’ “stories”—is clear and consistent, and his interiority feels specific rather than generic. His emotional response to Elara’s words (“A profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze”) lands as earned. However, his internal conflict and contradictory impulses remain relatively understated; he rarely wavers or makes pressured micro-choices beyond reading and interpreting. The final acceptance of being “only a historian” is strong but could carry more dramatized cost if his desire to be more than that were more sharply rendered earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, temperament, and aesthetics cohere into a specific, memorable interior life, and his final decision to leave the lighthouse follows plausibly from his long-stated desire to “transpose life into a new key.” His accidental prophecy trait and reputation as a covert operator are well integrated into how he thinks about his task. However, his internal conflict at the end remains muted; the cost of leaving (attachments, fears, regrets) is more implied than felt. The piece leans toward elegant consistency rather than richly contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Alistair’s motivation and method are sharply drawn—his use of sound and questions instead of holy water makes him feel specific and credible under pressure. Elara is more a vessel than a fully realized character, though her brief recovery (“It was... so quiet in there”) hints at a self beyond the possession. Emotional states are largely implied through action and image rather than embodied interiority, which keeps things taut but slightly cool. The final exchange lands as earned, but we never see much contradiction or real wobble in Alistair himself.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—relief from “chronological homesickness” via mastering time’s music—is specific, felt, and consistently dramatized through his obsessive mapping and physical exhaustion. Interior life is vivid and embodied (the ache in his bones, the nautilus under his thumb) rather than generic. The final shift from lament to “foundational note” reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a tidy cure. The only ceiling here is that his contradictions under pressure (e.g., doubt vs. hubris, fear vs. drive) are implied more than directly dramatized in on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (to escape the loop by confronting the core memory) is clear and consistent, and the internal arc from avoidance to acceptance is cleanly rendered. Interiority is specific—his reinterpretation of the tablet from map to codex is character-revealing rather than generic. However, the struggle feels relatively smooth; contradictory impulses (“I want to stay numb” vs “I must look”) are implied more than dramatized in-scene. The final integration of the echoes back into him reads earned but could carry sharper on-page resistance and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to pierce her emotional numbness through a new form of music—is clear, consistent, and embodied in concrete choices (the turntable, the broken needle, the cavern). Her deafness is not just a label but shapes perception and method. The internal journey is more linear yearning than conflicted push-pull, so we see little simultaneous contradiction under pressure. Still, the final reconfiguration of her relationship to silence feels earned by the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sharply drawn: his devotion to atmospheric data, solitude, and “fragile integrity” gives him a distinct inner life and credible motive for engaging with the anomaly. His micro-choices—approaching the pigeon, decoding the data, choosing a lateral, secretive approach—align cleanly with that characterization. What’s missing at this length for a higher score is a more dramatized internal contradiction or visible, on-page emotional cost beyond a refined sense of unease. The final decision feels apt but relatively un-tormented, more intellectual than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—escaping and then confronting grief through scent—is clear, specific, and steadily intensified. His inner state feels embodied (the vial as “anchor,” breath as “careful, measured act”) and his final decision to fully breathe in the Somniflora reads as a credible earned shift rather than a flip. The main limitation is that his internal conflict (avoidance vs. desire to understand) could be dramatized with one more concrete moment of almost-bolting or flinching to complicate the turn. As is, the arc is strong but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (to understand the texture of time) is clear, particular, and organically tied to his poet identity, and it convincingly shapes his refusal of both offered options. His ethically playful nature appears in the “library of burned books” line and in how he treats the dilemma as a riddle rather than a doctrinal choice. Internal conflict between safety, dissolution, and a hard, lonely awareness is present, though the emotional cost could be embodied a bit more viscerally. The final choice to “remain the poet” feels earned by prior perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (“a quiet rebellion against the void…to find beauty in the unfinished song of the world”) is clear and consistently embodied in her ritual and performance. Her interiority is specific and sensorial—the hush as condition, her hearing of “the whisper of her own blood.” However, we get relatively little contradiction or internal conflict under pressure; she moves fairly smoothly from memory to resolution. The final shift to feeling “completion” is emotionally plausible but slightly tidy for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is rich and specific, with his mix of professional rigor and genuine empathy driving every action (“To know a feeling was not enough; he had to let it become him”). The contradiction between his thoroughness and the personal cost of absorbing sorrow is clearly dramatized rather than merely stated. His final acceptance of leaving the sorrow as “residue in his own soul” reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. The only slight limitation is that his flaws and blind spots stay mostly implicit rather than being pushed into sharper tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias and Alina are both vivid and particular, with clear motives rooted in work, grief, and a bias toward “silent contributors.” His choice to risk emotional exposure by creating the grant is well-motivated by his earlier observations and values. However, internal contradiction is muted—Elias’s “cautious exuberance” never seriously pulls against a counter-impulse once the scene starts, so the decision feels brave but not truly fraught. The relationship dynamic is tender and specific, but slightly idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s longing and sense of unworthiness are specific and consistent, and his choices (joining the search, pointing out the fissure, working overnight) all clearly flow from that motivation. The interiority is mostly concrete and character-particular (“sculptor of transient things in a world of permanence”), with embodied emotion in the nervous heart, sleepless night, and tactile work. Internal conflict—his desire to belong vs. feeling he has “no claim” to the community’s resilience—does surface in scene, though it could be sharpened under more direct pressure from others. The final renunciation/dedication feels earned, with a visible cost in redirecting his art toward communal preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has clear, consistent motivations (curiosity about pattern; urgent need to protect the city), and his observational, methodical nature feels coherent with his profession. However, he lacks real internal contradiction or visible emotional struggle under pressure; he moves from realization to solution with minimal psychic cost. The final insight about echoes and artistry is thematically apt but somewhat tidy, more contemplative than hard-won. A bit more embodied fear or conflict between wonder at the Chronovore and terror for the city would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to quantify his grief rather than deny it—is specific, consistent, and convincingly tied to his conjuring practice, and the final earned stasis (“He could continue”) clearly grows out of his prior choices. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with grief framed through geometry and magic rather than generic lament. The piece is somewhat tidy emotionally—his breakthrough is smooth and low-friction—but it still feels paid for by the long, implied duration of his effort. A hint more on-page contradiction or self-sabotage under pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivations and methods are clear, specific, and grounded in lived routine, and his guiding desire “to become visible to those who need you” is both particular and emotionally legible. The tension between his wish to remain unseen and his need for his work to be found gives him some quiet contradiction. Anya is mostly an observed figure rather than a fully realized character, which keeps the relational pressure fairly one-sided. The final sense of earned satisfaction (“He had not been seen, but he had been found.”) is well motivated by all that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interior life is specific, embodied, and consistent; his raw knuckles, fogged breath, and tight jaw give the emotional arc credible physical stakes. His reluctance around retirement and identity loss is well-motivated and carries through to the final choice to clear the wreckage instead of forcing repair. The internal contradiction—control vs surrender—is present on the page, not just asserted. The only limitation is that his flaws are thematically clean and a bit idealized, with little true moral messiness or self-sabotage beyond stubbornness.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his sleeplessness, self-mocking “fool’s errand” attitude, and compulsion to make meaning all cohere and visibly drive his choices. The decision to trade the brooch for the story is motivated and reveals a clear value hierarchy (meaning over possession). The woman is more sketched than deeply inhabited, though her inherited hope/loss comes through in a few efficient strokes. Emotional embodiment at the key exchange could be fractionally richer or more contradictory to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and specific—her blend of protectiveness, erosion of certainty, and ultimate recognition of her own obsolescence feels earned and character-particular. Her micro-choices (blocking Kael, then lowering her hand) clearly dramatize an internal conflict between fear and stewardship. Kael is more archetypal and lightly sketched, functioning mostly as instrument rather than fully pressured character, which slightly flattens the relational crucible. Still, the emotional turn at the threshold reads motivated and carries a real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s vocation and motive are clear, and his quiet, patient temperament is consistently embodied in his movements and perceptions. The old woman is efficiently but vividly sketched, with her reaction to the valve revealing grief and latent resilience. However, Kaelen’s interiority remains relatively unconflicted—he never wavers or pays a personal price for his stance—so his arc is more affirmation than change. The lack of on-page inner contradiction keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clean, rooted in his need to find the fortress and understand his mentor’s fate, and his behavior tracks consistently with that aim. The “trembling certainty” gives him a specific emotional texture, and his perception of the city’s cracks feels character-particular. Internal conflict is muted—he rarely hesitates or grapples with competing values, so his final acceptance of guardianship lacks visible struggle or cost on the page. This keeps the arc compelling but not deeply transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, skepticism, and loyalty to his grandmother are clearly motivated and embodied in concrete actions (staying in the tower, nearly throwing the tile, then committing to the calculation). His internal tension between “bedrock facts” and honoring a “fanciful” wish is credible, though moments of realization veer a bit tidy (“simple, profound acceptance of connection”). The emotional turn at the end feels earned by prior resistance and struggle. Some complexity (e.g., more visible irritation, resentment, or fear) could deepen him further at this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Xylos’s motivation—an immortal driven by crushing boredom to seek a true end—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. His interiority is more conceptual than embodied, but still particular enough to feel like a personality rather than a stock “tired god.” The internal conflict between the curse’s survival instinct and his desire for oblivion is present but could be sharpened into more moment-to-moment friction rather than a single flare. His final choice to step into the rift is well-motivated and forecloses a path with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s psychology is specific and coherent—her honesty against her father’s grift, the atonement drive, and her comfort in the prep room give her distinct edges. Her core motivation (a “fair trade”) clearly drives her choice to risk forging documents to save Silus. However, once the plan is in motion, we see little live, contradictory impulse or visible doubt; she reads almost too composed for the stakes. Mr. Silus himself is more function than character, which slightly limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is coherent and specific—a solitary, meticulous artisan whose routines and tools feel lived-in and psychologically plausible. Her motivation “to collect the textures of different times” is clear and consistently enacted through ritualized work. However, we rarely see true internal contradiction or destabilizing doubt; she moves from intention to execution to satisfaction without much on-page ambivalence. The ending reads as endurance rather than a complicated choice, with the emotional cost of that endurance only faintly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—to fabricate a textured past out of others’ memories—is clear, particular, and drives every choice on the page. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory focus (sound, smell, touch) rather than abstract psychological labels. The internal contradiction between “erasure as freedom” and a deep hunger for belonging is strong but remains more observed than truly tested by on-page pressure. The ending offers an earned endurance rather than a sharp turn, which fits the mode but keeps the arc just shy of fully transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched: a “myth buster” who abandons public acclaim for an obscure, almost private truth, and his choices all flow from this. His emotional life is embodied (dust motes as audience, “gloomy cheerfulness”) and particular rather than generic. Internal tension between careerist options and ascetic obsession is implied rather than dramatized in direct conflict, so the cost at the end is felt but still somewhat understated. The final stance—accepting a possibly lifelong, solitary task—reads as an earned endurance rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation and internal split between anarchic loyalty to the Revel and pragmatic survival are clear and compelling, and his “orderly mind” directly drives his strategic choices. The culture shock absorber idea gives him a distinct social function, and his interaction with Zola shows him taking a real risk under pressure. Emotional embodiment is decent (“heart a frantic drum”) but occasionally leans on summary rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the peak beats. The final stance—accepting that he hasn’t saved the Revel but has altered its chances—is earned by the prior inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation (grandfather’s last request, rebellion against corporate indifference) is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his role as former nightwatch heir feels specific. However, his interior conflict is relatively simple—there’s little live tension between competing impulses beyond endurance vs. cold, so we don’t see a truly layered contradiction under pressure. The emotional beats are embodied (“beautiful, inevitable extinction,” the ache of the memory) but rarely surprise. The final endurance/renunciation (“He had outlasted the night and honored the legacy”) is earned but not particularly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is crisply drawn as a competent, calm, blind artisan whose methods and choices clearly express who she is. Her motivation is simple and believable, and her tactile way of “seeing” gives her a distinct interiority even without much explicit thought on the page. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or doubt under pressure; we see resolve and fatigue, but not a real clash of impulses. That lack of inner friction keeps the characterization just shy of top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and credible: the dry humor, bodily discomfort, and meticulous reliance on tools all fit a senior editor pushed into obsession. His motivation—to vindicate his mentor and witness the singular convergence—feels clear and consistent, and the final shift from “atlas editor” to “sole archivist” is an earned, if quiet, reconfiguration. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal conflict or contradiction under peak pressure; he never seriously wavers or reveals a cost beyond professional identity. The piece reads more as a portrait of competence and fascination than a crucible that exposes his flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated by restoring the town’s “note” and shared balance, and his profession and tools feel specific and grounded. However, he’s almost entirely without internal conflict or contradiction; “infinitely patient” and calm competence flatten his emotional range. We get little sense of personal cost, doubt, or desire beyond the mission. This keeps him from reading as fully three-dimensional at a literary-magazine standard.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is sharply defined—this is someone who will trade their life to "harness the ephemeral"—and that obsession credibly outweighs survival instinct at the climax. The internal conflict between flight and completion is well-embodied through borrowed memories and bodily distress. Interiority stays specific to this character’s vocation and worldview rather than generic angst. The only limiter is that we glimpse mainly a single, noble facet of them; their flaw (obsession) is compelling but not deeply contradictory beyond the survival vs purpose axis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—to escape his father’s legacy by owning a true, singular story—is clear and specific, and it credibly drives both his accepting the post and breaking the seal. Interiority is rich and character-particular (“a name that tasted like a lie”), with a believable mix of hunger for truth and awareness he won’t be believed. The main on-page choice (opening the door, breaking the hush) is well motivated and has a conceptual cost. Internal contradiction (need for validation vs. disdain for others’ doubts) is present but could be pushed slightly harder in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s interiority is specific enough to feel like a person rather than a role, and Lyra’s devotion reads clearly through her effects on the greenhouse. Motivation via the bead and debt across lifetimes is coherent and seeded early. However, Elian remains largely reactive, with limited on-page micro-choices under pressure, and we see little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle as the climax approaches. The recovered backstory at the end is evocative but arrives as a near-instant download rather than a contested realization.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and specific—his “quiet, fervent prayer” to turn ruin into reverence—and his actions under pressure (racing into the storm to anchor the threads) grow credibly from that core. Interiority is textured and embodied (“cool weight a shock,” “hands bleeding”) without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: his panic and desperate pragmatism coexist with the same haunting optimism that drives the sleep-weaving, though that conflict could be dramatized more explicitly at the storm’s peak. The final change—his private impulse becoming shared, communal meaning—lands as earned, but we see more of the world’s shift than his inner revaluation in that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore faith in her lineage by physically reclaiming her great-grandmother’s tomb—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“a profound hollowness where her faith in their stories should have been”), and the shift to acceptance at the end feels earned by her work in the orchard. However, on-page internal contradiction is relatively muted; she moves from doubt to understanding without much dramatized push-pull between competing impulses in the peak beats. The relationship with the mason is purely functional and never becomes a crucible, which keeps the emotional field quite narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s vocation, worldview, and habits are sharply drawn and consistent, and his motivations (protecting ghosts in the margins via analog means) feel organic. However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or emotional pressure on him; he performs his task with serene competence. The lack of on-page cost or genuine micro-struggle in his choices keeps the characterization from feeling fully lived under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is specific, competent, and motivated; her disguise as a foolish old embroiderer, her intuition, and her loyalty all read clearly and drive action. Her micro-choices—altering the Serpent’s Coil, deciding to exploit the calibration window, using the auxiliary terminal despite her supposed incompetence—align well with her traits. Internal conflict (fear vs. duty, attachment to her role vs. risk of exposure) is more implied than dramatized in-body, which slightly blunts the emotional peak. A touch more embodied stress at the console would elevate the characterization to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara and Kael both feel particular and motivated: her “fierce tenderness” and physical depletion give her choices weight, and Kael’s need for origin-point clarity rather than simple regret is specific. The internal contradiction of offering a bone-setting level of pain in service of healing is strong. Kael is more reacted-upon than agentive, but his breakdown at the end clearly reconfigures his self-understanding. There’s little on-page friction between competing impulses in the present moment, which keeps this just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply drawn: a war translator whose calm, interpretive instinct collides with his own buried trauma (the brain coral, the ruined village). His “shrewdly innocent” demeanor is dramatized in how he coaxes Anja’s meanings and then reframes them for Varin. The General is efficiently sketched but gains dimensionality in the closing flicker from commander to father. Emotional responses and micro-choices feel embodied and specific, with no tidy or unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s core motivation—to rediscover a lost, specific joy—feels clean, embodied, and consistent, and his actions (consulting the network, going to the wall, using the fragment) clearly arise from that ache. Interiority is well-rendered in sensory terms rather than labels, especially around the fragility of memory-as-light. The internal conflict is relatively gentle—frustration versus patience—so we don’t see deeply contradictory impulses or a truly pressured value trade. The final emotional state (bittersweet acceptance) is earned but not radically reconfiguring of his self-conception.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched as methodical yet playful, and his shift from wanting to return to embracing the puzzle feels organically motivated. The interiority is specific (cataloguing harmonies, noticing key shifts) rather than generic. However, his internal conflict is relatively low-friction; once curiosity takes hold, there’s little sense of genuine struggle or cost in that transition.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s characterization as a charming, ruthless “rogue scholar” is clear and specific, and his motivation (protecting untaxable thought) coherently drives his choices. The small gestures—the sunflower as an “erased” comrade, the warmth of the seed—give him embodied emotion rather than pure abstraction. However, his internal conflict at the peak (risking wiping “a dozen city blocks of consciousness”) is rushed, with minimal hesitation, which softens the felt cost of his decision. Aris functions well as a pressure-bearing secondary, but their relationship doesn’t quite become a crucible that changes state by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent; her sleeplessness, postcard fixation, and poetic “photosynthesis” of pain all feel of a piece. The internal conflict between longing for elsewhere and accepting her solitary vocation is credible and resolved through an earned shift in stance rather than a cheap cure. Her final choice to write on the postcard and relocate it is a concrete, motivated act that crystallizes her new relationship to pain. The only limit is that all pressure remains internal and somewhat abstract, with no external character or concrete dilemma to further stress-test her contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation as the last caretaker is clear and consistent, and his actions (seeking the melody, lighting the orchid, resuming patrol) all track cleanly with that role. Interiority is evocative but skews toward a single vector—duty braided with sadness—without much on-page contradiction or live internal debate. The “foxglove regret” hints at a deeper conflict between preservation and the pain it costs him, but this never quite flowers into a pressured choice. Overall, he feels specific and embodied, but not yet maximally complex.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and specific—restore trust with Elara—and his “carefully reckless” nature is dramatized through the forbidden linguistic gamble. His fear, guilt, and love all coexist credibly in the moment, and his choice to risk catastrophic magical backlash feels earned. Elara is thinner but still registers as a person with guarded pain and agency in her final gesture. The cost to him (blood, danger, vulnerability) and the fragile, non-triumphal reconciliation give the character work weight without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s worldview is concretely tied to his craft—pressure, release, regulators—and his drive to decode the envelope and chain feels motivated and specific. The misbelief about his father and its correction are cleanly set up and paid off. However, his internal conflict unfolds smoothly rather than under real strain; contradictory impulses (resentment vs loyalty, anger vs protectiveness) are implied more than dramatized in the present moment. The emotional shift at the end is convincing but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, rituals, and compulsive reinvention of his past create a coherent, specific psychology that credibly drives his choices, especially the late confession and the gift of Lyra. Internal contradiction—his urge to erase the truth versus his obsessive preservation of Lena’s music—is dramatized rather than told. Anna is lightly sketched but functions clearly as a gentle, steadying counterforce. The final shift from fabrication to disclosure feels earned and paid for in vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to understand “why some thresholds feel sacred” and to navigate the fractured realities—is clear and consistent, and his final choice to step through the irreversible threshold is well motivated. The inheritance from father and grandfather (maze-building, grain-reading, pilot logbook) gives him particular, non-generic competence. Emotional life is more conceptual than viscerally embodied, so we feel his stakes more in ideas than in gut-level sensation. Internal contradiction (pull of “home” vs acceptance of necessary distance) is present but could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation (to translate cosmic belonging into this harsh, mechanical world) is clear and coherently expressed through his choices, especially his months-long mapping and the risk of emotional exposure to Elara. Elara’s arc from curt skepticism to softened awe is efficient but believable. The internal conflict for Kaelen—grief over his lost home versus commitment to this new, alien “rhythm”—is present but resolved a bit too cleanly and quickly. The emotional shift lands, but the neatness of his final realization (“Belonging wasn’t about…”) slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s professional curiosity and gentle, puzzle-loving temperament are clear and consistent, and their actions (using the seeds, persisting in conjecture, risking the shard) all align with that. Interiority is concrete enough—reading emotions as colors, weighing possible causes—but rarely conflicted; there’s little sense of competing impulses under pressure. The final realization lands as earned but emotionally smooth, with limited felt cost for Kael beyond the risk of failure. This keeps the character engaging yet somewhat low-friction for elite-level short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation (“to serenade monotony with creativity”) is clear and every micro-choice—shaping the puddle, placing the coin—flows from that analytic, quasi-magician temperament. Interiority is spare but specific (“not from suspense, but from the quiet satisfaction of a solved equation”), giving him a distinct, non-generic mindset. The internal conflict is muted; he rarely feels genuinely torn or under emotional pressure, which keeps the arc more like a character study than a transformation. Still, his endurance/renunciation—anonymous creation with only “a small, internal smile” as reward—lands as a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to create a forbidden cosmic verse as proof that memory is not a disease—is clear and consistently embodied in his actions. His frustration at the elusive connection and subsequent shift when he focuses on the gaps feels psychologically credible. The internal change from exile as deprivation to exile as enabling condition is earned by the scene’s progression. Internal contradiction is present but somewhat muted; he remains serenely composed even under high stakes, which softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s vocation, worldview, and core motivation are clearly and specifically rendered, and his final renunciation (choosing not to save the atrium) is plausibly earned by the preceding interiority. His way of thinking—“not with a spirit or a god, but with the fundamental grammar of the world itself”—feels particular, not generic. However, his internal conflict remains relatively low-grade: he moves toward acceptance with little on-page resistance or contradiction beyond a muted melancholy, which softens the sense of cost. A bit more simultaneous attachment and reluctance in the final approach to the atrium would deepen the character change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply realized: the scar, the careful handling of the box, and his choice in the Holloway fire all build a coherent hierarchy of values with visible cost. His need to enlighten rookies through his own damage gives him a clear, specific motivation. Kaelen is thinner but functional as a foil and inheritor of the lesson. The only limit is that the emotional progression lands a bit neatly into articulated insight rather than showing more messy contradiction in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply defined and consistent—she’s framed as a “logical dreamer” intent on solving hope like an equation, and all her actions align with that. Interiority is specific and grounded in observation rather than stock emotion, and her moment of fear when the needle plunges adds texture. However, she remains largely unconflicted and emotionally controlled; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or personal cost beyond intellectual stakes. The closure is an earned endurance/success rather than a difficult renunciation, which keeps the character work strong but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s profession, temperament, and ethics are clearly sketched and consistently motivate her choices—from investigating the study to returning the evidence. Her interiority is particular (listening to “what walls dream about”) rather than generic. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is muted; she never seems truly torn between exposing and preserving the secret, so the final renunciation feels contemplative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mirage painter’s motives and methods are clear and consistent—he gathers the city’s “collective sigh” to seed possibilities—but his internal life remains largely unconflicted. He’s defined more by function and aura than by contradictory impulses or a meaningful flaw. The “borrowed heartbeat” hints at a deeper cost or tension that never quite manifests as struggle. For elite publication, we’d want at least one moment where his calm is tested or his purpose complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and his gentle-but-steeled demeanor feels particular rather than generic. The generals are more archetypal than individuated, but their exhaustion and tiny tells (Kaelen’s knuckles, Vorlag’s grunt) give the negotiation some human grain. The key turn—Elias choosing ritual over argument—feels motivated by his read of their war-weariness. What’s missing at elite level is more contradictory interior pressure inside at least one of the signatories, beyond a simple hard/softening line.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a ruthless water baron driven by an almost childlike longing for lost birdsong, and his contradictory impulses—control vs. penance, pragmatism vs. sentimentality—are credible and active. His choice to dissolve the last egg feels motivated by decades of guilt and obsession. Emotions are largely embodied in concrete perceptions (salt, heat, the egg in his hands). A slight tendency to explain his motives in abstract terms (“gesture of fractured grace”) keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive and professional ethos are clear and specific, and her work with the echoes tracks cleanly with her values. However, she moves through the story with almost no visible ambivalence or degradation under pressure; her serenity largely flattens potential internal conflict. The final act lands as fulfillment of a long-held plan rather than a choice with sharply felt cost. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s intellectual arrogance, aesthetic sensibility, and sudden ethical doubt are all well-drawn and specific, with the story stick and the hollow-eyed man concretizing his inner conflict. His philosophy of withholding conclusions is clear and consistent, and Elara’s off-page presence still exerts pressure as a credible counterforce. The final decision to “answer” his own story feels earned by the prior reflection and his core obsession rather than a neat flip. If anything, I’d welcome one sharper moment of visceral, bodily reaction to complement the cerebral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his actions, and his “esoteric realist” stance gives him an interesting, particular worldview. However, his interior conflict is minimal—he arrives already reconciled to extinction, so we don’t see much in-scene contradiction or strain between competing impulses. The closing acceptance therefore feels like a deepening rather than a hard-won turn. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully immersive, crucible-level interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s core motivation (to preserve forgotten names) is clear and coherently rooted in his past failure and later self-forgiveness, and his “technically gentle” precision nicely embodies that arc. The calm vs “snowmelt ardor” gives him some inner contradiction, and his emotional journey from focus to fulfillment is legible. However, he encounters almost no real resistance or dilemma on the page, so we see little of him under genuine pressure. The final choice to cast the sigil in silver feels apt but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s fractured relationship to time is specific and embodied, and his motivation—understanding the directive and the “path”—is clear and consistent. His micro-choices (using dreams instead of force, then deciding to ingest the seal) track well with that psychology. Internal conflict could be sharpened slightly; he pivots from confusion to conviction about the seal being a gate with relatively little on-page resistance or doubt. Still, the final transformation into presence feels earned by the prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kavi’s characterization is specific and coherent: a frugal, data-obsessed astronomer whose “lifetime of thrift” is spent in one extravagant act, and whose choice to erase all evidence at the end fits his values. His motivation—to trade part of his soul for hidden knowledge—is clear and consistent. What’s missing for a higher score is more dramatized contradiction under pressure; his doubt or fear never pushes back against his resolve in-scene, so internal conflict feels conceptual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s characterization as a “schemer who built cures instead of weapons” is clear, consistent, and her pacifism directly shapes tactics, but she remains more archetypal function than psychologically complex person. Her motivation (to heal Vale and the universe) is strong yet largely untroubled by doubt or contradictory impulses. Vale’s presence as an entity is thematically potent, but its interiority and specific motives beyond abstract “resentment” remain thin. The final choice feels earned causally, but emotional cost is muted by Elara’s near-angelic composure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her relationship to her father and his failed ambition, and her actions track cleanly with that drive. The embodied ritual of the breathing and her handling of the sextant and mirror give her interiority a tactile, character-particular feel. However, she experiences little on-page internal contradiction or real wavering; she moves calmly from intention to fulfillment, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. The final acceptance of the vision’s collapse feels earned but could carry more bite if a conflicting impulse (fear of failure, resentment of the dream) had been dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motives are clear and layered—professional pride, love for Lyra, and loyalty to tradition—and his final shift toward her worldview is well-grounded in earlier beats. The quartz-eye detail and his tactile engagement with tools and ribbon give his interiority specificity rather than generic angst. The conflict between his clinging to vows and his dawning recognition of “deciduous vows” plays convincingly within a single scene. The only shortfall is that his epiphany comes a bit swiftly and cleanly, with limited on-page resistance at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s bewilderment, compulsion toward forbidden knowledge, and rule-breaking curiosity are clear, and his interiority has some sharp, particular turns (“trying to remember the future”). The internal contradiction between mandate (“never, ever try to understand”) and motive is strong and drives the story. His breakthrough feels earned by prior obsession, but the emotional cost of accepting himself as “conduit” is under-dramatized—he adjusts quickly to a “new and terrible clarity” with limited friction. More embodied struggle or hesitation at the end would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—from academic curiosity to an urgent, ethically driven quest—grounded in her arcane-linguist mindset. Her interiority feels specific (reading the library as “symphony,” hunting absences) and her tactics align with being “carefully resourceful.” The main limitation is emotional flatness around Kael and the future stakes; her personal fear, doubt, or selfish impulses never truly complicate her resolve. As a result, the final choice feels admirable and coherent but not profoundly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim the absorbed life of her chimera twin—is clear, specific, and consistently drives each choice with the swatches. Her internal state is vivid and character-particular (“both herself and the negative space he’d left behind”), with a credible cost when her own identity thins at the climax. The main limitation is that her contradictory impulses (wanting him back vs preserving herself) stay more implied than dramatized in concrete, in-the-moment micro-choices. Still, the final acceptance—shifting from seeker to “keeper”—feels earned by what’s come before.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined—curious, precise, committed to “translating confusion into clarity”—and his actions align cleanly with that ethos. His professional competence is convincing, and his choices clearly drive events. What’s missing, at this standard, is genuine internal friction or visible emotional cost: he never really doubts, fears, or pays a price for engaging with something this dangerous. The arc is more a smooth execution of expertise than a pressured change or costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and specific, and his professional identity as the last ripple-mark mapkeeper ties cleanly to his method and choices. Interiority is vivid in sensory terms, but his psychology remains relatively singular—driven and weary, with little contradiction or moral tension. The endurance and strain in the conjuring beat do read on the body, which helps. Still, he feels more like a well-drawn archetype than a fully particular, conflicted person.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motivation—to prove that coincidences have meaning and to break the generational silence—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized in his obsession with the prism and the star-lanes. His internal conflict spikes effectively when he contemplates accepting silence as the “true state of things” before choosing connection. Emotions are embodied through sensory experiences (the shard’s suffocating void, his shaking hands) rather than labels. The final choice to place the shard feels earned by the accumulated labor and retrocognitive grief we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s vocation, sorrow, and preemptive nostalgia are clearly and distinctively rendered, and his final decision—to record the choice rather than undo the fog—flows plausibly from those traits. His interiority is specific and embodied (the “sharp” nostalgia, the frantic measuring). Internal conflict between duty to truth and compassion for his people is present but could be dramatized with slightly more resistance at the decision point. Overall, he feels like a real, particular person rather than a role.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s characterization is specific and textured—his chemical chants, craftsman’s “ambient awareness,” and response to the rag knot feel individual rather than generic. Motivation is clear (seeking a cure for the hush / resisting hopelessness) and his discouragement beat is believable. The final internal shift is earned by the sequence of perceptions, though his inner conflict never becomes sharply contradictory or morally fraught. This limits the depth of visible cost in his closing reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, especially in how her scientific, observational mindset refracts emotional pain through images of tidal pools and small creatures. Her coping mechanism—deflecting into pattern-seeking and natural metaphors—feels psychologically true. However, her shift from hurt to equanimity comes a bit too smoothly, with limited on-page struggle or contradictory impulses, and Kael remains largely a sketch rather than an active, pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motivation and wound (raised in a bunker, phobic of shelter yet obsessed with “flavors of different silences”) are distinct and consistently dramatized through action. His internal change—learning to carry the trellis’s spacious silence back into the bunker—feels earned by the experience above the clouds. Interiority is concrete and particular (“lungs seized in any room smaller than the sky”), with embodied emotion rather than labels. The only limitation is that the father and mother remain purely conceptual pressures, so relational conflict never quite ignites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation as a ferryman of states—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is clear and consistently enacted, and the woman’s fear-to-calm arc is legible and earned. However, both remain somewhat archetypal; we get little in the way of contradictory impulses or idiosyncratic specifics that would individualize them beyond their roles. The woman’s shift, while plausible, happens smoothly without much resistance or messiness, which softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are vividly established—she’s a historian using knowledge rather than force—and her choices drive every turn. The link between her identity as a Lore Keeper and her tactics (sonic architecture, careful peeling) is strong and character-specific. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely doubts, frays, or contradicts herself under pressure, which keeps her emotionally a bit too pristine for top-tier literary depth. The final beat implies cost in risk and solitude but doesn’t fully dramatize any lasting inner reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to impose a painful separation as “difficult mercy”—is clear, specific, and consistent with her choices, and Liam’s response (unlocking into breath rather than rage) feels emotionally earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“gritty ash crunching,” the iron against her scar) rather than label-y. However, Elara carries relatively little visible internal contradiction or doubt in the present scene, which slightly flattens complexity at the crucial act of reaching out. The relationship dynamic is strong in absentia but never placed under direct, on-page friction between them.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—shaped by OmniVex trauma, lingering conceptual “Debt,” and a resolve to turn pressure into value—and it cleanly drives her choice to engage the Quantum Promise. Her internal conflict between temptation and distrust is dramatized (the siren-call of effortless success vs. the grounding reality of the bolt), not just asserted. The lie to the overseers and her reliance on the bolt both reveal character under pressure in concrete ways. The cost is mostly risk and the foreclosing of “easy” transcendence rather than a more ambivalent or self-wounding choice, which keeps this just shy of truly searing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—uncovering the guarded family secret—is clear and sustained, and her emotional pivot from self-perceived failure to “destination” is coherent and earned. Interiority is specific at the sensory level (hum in her bones, golden shadows), though the emotional path to understanding feels almost too smooth and tidy for such a profound revelation. We see little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine flaw; she is primarily a pure seeker and vessel. Still, her final revaluation of herself and her line lands credibly within the established character.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s core motivation—to prevent dissolution and preserve possibility—is clear and consistently enacted, and his competence under pressure feels earned. However, his interiority remains relatively one-note; we don’t see much contradictory impulse (fear vs duty, reluctance vs devotion) at the moment of severing the clasp. Embodied emotion is strong in the sensory experience of the energy wave, but less so beforehand, where his mindset reads as serenely resolved rather than truly torn. The final endurance of his solitary watch feels appropriate but could land with more visible personal cost if his tether to reality were framed as something he’s genuinely afraid to lose.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief and professional devotion interlock cleanly—her work as balm is dramatized through her choices to notice the dust pattern, risk unfolding the paper, and ritualize preserving the button. Her emotions are embodied and specific (“brittle ledger,” “breathing in history itself”), not generic. The internal shift from raw ache to “tactfully hopeful” is earned by the concrete discovery of the hidden message. The one limitation is that her inner conflict (work as escape vs. exposure to pain) is implied rather than sharply dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization as an underestimated, mid-level archivist turned quiet insurgent is vivid and specific, and her motivation (“to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference”) is clearly rooted in both personality and context. Her perceptions of the world (puddles as maps, the key as “the last solid thing”) effectively encode her inner life. However, she faces little on-page moral or emotional dilemma; her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized, and we rarely see contradictory impulses tugging at her in real time. The endurance at the end feels earned, but the visible cost to her personally could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation and role are clear and compelling—he’s defined by his duty to maintain the “vested hush” and his dread of the prophecy. His emotions are embodied in small, specific ways (the weight of the saxophone, the clench in his stomach), but his inner life stays relatively simple: duty versus dread with little contradictory impulse on the page. The inherited legacy and “eerie nostalgia” hint at deeper conflict, yet they remain atmospheric rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices. The final endurance of his role feels earned but could carry sharper on-page cost or ambiguity about why he continues.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to his work and the prophecy, and his interiority feels embodied (“mossy delight,” trembling precision). However, his inner life remains largely single-note—curiosity and tenderness—without much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt at the key choice to prod the speck. The transformation at the end is earned but emotionally easy, with little visible cost or resistance. The piece could reach a higher tier with one moment where fear, doubt, or reluctance complicates his drive.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s worldview as a “tinkerer of broken time” is distinctive and his curiosity credibly drives every action, from following the cogs to improvising the pivot. His emotional state is mostly embodied via sensory focus and physical acts (prying stone, holding his breath), though the internal struggle between needing systems to make sense and accepting irreparable chaos could surface more directly in-scene. The final acceptance—“part of the question”—is earned but the line “His goal had been to befriend uncertainty in planning” reads more like retrospective thesis than lived conflict. Still, he feels like a particular human rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s grief and motivation are clear, embodied, and consistent, and his alchemical choices map cleanly to his internal need to “redeem” rather than resurrect. The balance he must maintain between grief and joy gives him a specific, character-shaped tension rather than generic mourning. However, his interiority stays largely on one track—haunted but resolute—so we don’t see much in-the-moment contradiction or messy irrationality. The final shift to “luminous regret” feels earned but relatively tidy given the depth of his loss.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas is clearly motivated, distinct in role and temperament, and his methods (the crocodile tooth, his gentle persistence) feel character-specific rather than generic. His emotional life is sketched more through vocation than contradiction—he’s deeply capable and rarely conflicted, which flattens potential tension. The spirit is vivid but fairly single-note beyond grief and one reclaimed memory. The closing “luminous ache” suggests cost, but his internal struggle could be sharpened for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and particular—his hyper-awareness of “every muscle fiber” and the paradox of feeling “displaced rooted” give him a distinct psychological texture. Motivation is clear and consistent: to answer the cold logic of his tormentors by finding the “mathematics of mercy.” However, his emotional life skews conceptual rather than messily human; he processes extreme trauma with a cool, almost analytic detachment that blunts potential contradiction and struggle. The final shift from desperation to purposeful acceptance is earned but could carry more felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she’s driven to honor “overlooked histories” and that throughline holds from the grandfather’s gift to the St. Elmo’s release—but interior conflict is minimal, with little sense of competing impulses under pressure. Interiority is specific and sensory, but her emotional texture stays largely steady (no real fear, doubt, or temptation to look away from the truth). The final act of “unfastening the lie” is well motivated by prior lines. This is strong, if somewhat emotionally safe, characterization for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo’s characterization is precise and coherent—his liminal vocation, upward-focused curiosity, and calm professionalism all align with his choices, especially at the “moment of choice.” The “weightless burden” of seeing ghosts feels specific rather than generic angst. Internal conflict—leave vs. engage—is present but lightly sketched; he never feels genuinely torn or at risk. That slight undercutting of struggle keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Operator’s motivation is clear and specific (“to compress eternity into a moment”), and their actions align cleanly with that goal. However, they remain more archetype than individual; we get almost no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or distinct interior texture under pressure. The character’s change is largely conceptual (becoming the moment/eternity) rather than dramatized through internal conflict. This keeps the piece from landing a deeper, character-driven cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is rich and specific: a failed revolutionary turned archivist whose hunger to “restore their soul” clearly drives every perception and choice. His actions under pressure—covering mirrors, leaving the shard exposed, deciding to wage a new, quieter revolution—align with his history and temperament. The emotional texture (burnished regret shifting into a rekindled fire) feels earned rather than announced. The only limit is that his conflict with Valerius is entirely offstage, so his motivations are tested more conceptually than interpersonally.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive and nature are clear and specific—his love of precise craft grounds the world-scale stakes well. His doubt versus humble competence forms a credible internal conflict, and the lie exploiting his self-doubt is nicely dramatized through his slip on the tuning screw. The final recommitment to being “just” a repairman is earned and tonally right, though the emotional arc resolves a bit quickly and cleanly. A touch more embodied stress or lingering cost would deepen him from well-drawn to indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s vocation, sensibility, and motivation are sharply drawn and feel organic, with her “petrichor collector” identity concretely shaping perception and choices. Her decision not to bottle the lagoon’s scent is thematically right and causally grounded in what we’ve seen of her. However, the piece largely sidesteps real internal conflict; she moves from curiosity to acceptance with little on-page struggle or contradictory impulse. A touch more visible ambivalence around leaving the ultimate specimen uncollected would deepen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s vocation, habits, and values are sharply drawn, and her shift from “artist” to “custodian” feels credibly motivated by the lantern’s revelations and the imminent threat. Her physical struggle with driftwood and stone grounds her competence and fear. Internal contradictions are relatively muted—she pivots from panic to near-perfect clarity quickly—but the moment is still believable under extreme pressure. The closing repricing of her life’s work is earned by what we’ve seen of her obsessions and skills.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and obsession are cleanly established, and her actions (weeks of observation, returning with filters, decoding the layers) arise credibly from those traits. The inheritance reveal effectively back-fills her motivation without feeling like a cheat. However, internal contradiction and on-page ambivalence are underplayed; she rarely seems truly torn or pressured, which flattens her emotional range. The final realization lands, but the sense of cost or unresolved flaw is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motivation as a civil-rights archivist compelled to uncover Elara’s buried truth is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially his shift in negotiation strategy at the lagoon. His emotional state—despair, strain, stubborn persistence—is embodied through sensory detail (heat, searing sunlight, trembling fingers). Internal contradiction (his need for truth vs. the psychic cost of retrocognition) is present but could be pushed further into more fraught, on-page hesitation or self-betrayal to hit a top-tier band. The antagonist-figure is necessarily indistinct yet still functions as a credible opposing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s grief, integrity, and refusal of illusion are clear and specific, and his decision to begin the “great work” reads as motivated and consistent with his alchemist identity. His interiority is well-embodied in choices (using working memory, refusing to break the bottle) rather than labels. However, his emotional life is relatively singular—lonely yet resolute—with little on-page contradiction or irrationality under pressure. The piece would reach a higher tier with a sharper dramatization of his temptation to quit or embrace easier false comforts in the moment, not only in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian is sharply etched through vocation, ritual, and perception; his field-trip key and reverence for the archive feel character-specific rather than generic. His motivation—to record emotion as sacred duty—is clear and credibly overturned by the revelation. The final shift from loyalty to the archive toward a grim new duty to the living reads earned, though it’s more a conceptual pivot than a dramatized, contested choice. What’s missing for the very top tier is on-page pressure forcing visible, moment-to-moment internal contradiction rather than a mostly smooth progression from curiosity to dread to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a steward seeking understanding rather than possession is vivid and consistent, and her calm, methodical choices under pressure feel specific to her. However, there’s little true internal conflict or doubt on the page; she never seriously wavers or risks a mistaken tactic. Emotional embodiment is largely subsumed into the lyric description of the environment rather than expressed through contradictory impulses. The final “completion” lands, but with limited felt personal cost or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—favoring listening over noise—is clear, consistent, and directly drives his climactic choice to reroute the sirens. His curiosity and humility are well sketched, and his competence feels grounded. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he reads as quietly certain rather than genuinely torn, which slightly flattens the emotional complexity of the decision. A bit more embodied hesitation or fear at the brink would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to find strength in vulnerability—is clearly seeded early and pays off credibly in the climax and reflection. His interiority is specific (the janitor vs. seeker tension, his identification with falling stars) rather than generic. The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains relatively smooth; he moves from detachment to revelation without much resistance or messy contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn through his long silence, reverence for the box, and the specific content of the words he never spoke. His motivation to protect memory by not speaking is clear and organically re-examined. The relationship with Lyra, though one-sided on the page, feels lived-in and exerts real pressure. The emotional shift at the end is convincing, if slightly tidy in how fully his miscalculation is articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand the “texture of time”—is clear, specific, and coherently drives his choices (the garage sale, the obsession with the urn). His interiority has strong, concrete touches (“thinning of the light within his own bones”), but we rarely see him under direct on-page pressure making a hard trade-off. The emotional shift at the end (from gnawing mortality to serene timelessness) is earned by prior setup, though it lands more as graceful solution than conflicted choice. The lack of a true internal contradiction playing out in-scene keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is specific and coherent—his reverent, fragment-seeking temperament cleanly explains why he responds to the child’s loss by foraging meaning rather than offering comfort. Embodied perception (“volumes of story held in shell and stone,” the feather as “a perfect question mark”) keeps emotion grounded. However, he experiences almost no true internal contradiction or pressure between incompatible impulses, which flattens potential complexity. The ending stance—keeping the feather, completing a “woven dawn”—costs him little beyond a quiet ache.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated by legacy and interspecies communion, and his choices (undertaking the copper project, persisting despite illness, making the final connection) all align with that drive. His interiority is concrete and specific—time as a “different currency,” negotiating “the terms of his departure”—but internal contradiction and genuine conflict are muted. We rarely see impulses that pull against his serene resolve, which flattens complexity somewhat. Still, his final earned stasis, accepting death as the cost for his creation, is well prepared and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s skepticism, professional stance, and private susceptibility are sharply drawn, and his final act of placing the amber feels well-earned by prior interiority. The motivation (to understand “the chemistry of homecoming”) is clear, specific, and coherently pursued. Internal contradiction—dismissive of the pilgrimage yet compelled by it—runs consistently through the piece. The only mild limitation is that his emotional reversal lands a bit tidily, flirting with thesis more than messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation (atonement through re-greening a dead sea) is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his meticulous work, and the “coachman” redefinition is intriguing. However, he faces little internal contradiction on the page; he never truly doubts, wavers, or reveals a competing desire. The endurance choice (“He would be back tomorrow”) has some cost (ache, scale of loss) but remains emotionally under-pressured for elite tier. Strong, but more textured ambivalence or blind spots under pressure would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (“to translate distance into closeness”) is clear, consistent, and her actions—repairing the player, decoding the grooves, undertaking the journey—align cleanly with it. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (the ache in her chest, the disappointment at static) rather than abstract. However, we see limited active internal contradiction or hard moral trade-off; the struggle is more painstaking than conflicted. The final realization about nurturing what’s left is earned but relatively low-cost emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her sense of being “temporally stretched” and her attachment to family ritual make her feel individual rather than archetypal. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the generational objects are well used to reveal her values. The main weakness is the relative smoothness of her shift from isolation to acceptance; we get little active resistance or simultaneous contradiction in the peak moment, so the epiphany feels a touch too clean for maximal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation as an “apprentice of wonder” and practitioner of “sacredly playful thievery” is clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially in planting a gift rather than stealing. However, he faces little genuine internal or external friction; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure, which keeps him pleasantly competent rather than fully dimensional. Sylas is sketched effectively in a few strokes (sterile room, childlike awe at the light) but remains more emblem than character. The final shift—Kael’s soul lighter—is thematically apt but arrives with minimal on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority—former crisis actor now refusing falsity—feels specific and motivates her coded walking and final risk cleanly, and the Regent’s self-image as a “surgeon” of the nation tracks to her hesitation and eventual key-turn. The embodied beats (thumb tremor on the knight, Elara’s tears cutting through grime) give non-generic access to both women. The main limitation is that the Regent’s pivot from “benevolently ruthless” to freeing the prisoner, while believable, happens very quickly and leans on symbolism more than a fully dramatized inner conflict. A touch more contradiction-on-the-page for her earlier would make that change feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, with clear fear, avoidance, and a deep, half-buried desire for “home” driving her choices. Her micro-choices—the decision to pursue the stone, to persist through disappointment, and finally to risk reopening her gift with the feather—feel motivated and consistent. The contradiction between using dissociative visions as comfort and seeking genuine rootedness is present and resolved with visible cost (she loses her nightly escapes). The one slight softness is how smoothly the final acceptance comes, but prior groundwork mostly earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation and flaw are precise, consistent, and drive every choice, from seeking the frozen town to rejecting the “simple, defensive move.” The internal conflict between pride and duty is dramatized through his interpretive work on the tapestry and labyrinth rather than just explained. The final acceptance of a non-brilliant move as “right” feels earned and forecloses his old self-concept with a clear emotional cost. Secondary characters exist only as memories, but they effectively sharpen his guilt and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to resist a monolithic “truth” by multiplying it—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her choices, especially in using the canyon as instrument. We get grounded, embodied emotion (“press against her skin,” “faces tight with…hope and terror”) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is lighter; she’s more saintly and unwavering than complex, with little sense of genuine doubt or selfish impulse complicating her courage. Kael functions effectively as a foil but exerts minimal real pressure on her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation and self-doubt are sharply etched (“an alchemist only by the grace of doubt”), and her internal conflict between grief-tainted memory and the need for truthful record is dramatized in concrete choices at each crack. The peak choice at the “star-shaped crater” is clearly motivated by her love and promise, not a sudden epiphany. Emotions are embodied (breath pressure, trembling fingers, phantom scent of soil) rather than labeled. The only minor limitation is that her voice skews uniformly elevated even under peak stress, which slightly mutes the sense of mental fraying.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief, reticence, and stubborn tenderness are clear, and his motivation to fulfill a private promise is consistent and drives every choice. The interiority is specific (“all forevers were temporary, but loving her for believing otherwise”) rather than generic. Internal contradiction is present but a bit underplayed—he’s almost too calm and self-possessed, with little felt struggle at the moment of letting the shell go. The final shift from burdened to owning his own weight is earned and legible, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—his belief in whispers over shouts and his attachment to his mother’s garden—and his actions under pressure arise cleanly from that. Interiority is textured (“agony of love, a screaming tenderness that had no voice”) and embodied without slipping into therapy-speak. What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper internal contradiction or visible moral cost; he never seriously doubts or pays beyond exertion. Hemlock’s off-page presence gives some relational tension but isn’t fully dramatized as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, purpose, and competence are clearly motivated, and his embodied reactions (tears cutting through grime, the weight and warmth of the bronze) feel particular rather than generic. His central want—to build a path home for others as a displaced surrogate for his daughter—is cleanly dramatized. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction: he doesn’t meaningfully waver, resist, or sabotage himself under pressure. The final acceptance reads earned but relatively straightforward rather than a crucible for conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s central drive—to protect a single memory from his own compulsive honesty—is specific, credible, and consistently rooted in his history with the empathy virus. Interiority is concrete and particular (“truthful bartering,” his calculation about which memory to shield) rather than generic. The final renunciation—accepting a partial, bounded truth with the neighbor—feels earned by the earlier setup. The only slight weakness is a touch of clinical diction (“psychological safety”) that flattens, very mildly, some emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and textured—his idea of the gulls as “gossips” and his method of “observing gaps” feel individuated. His duty vs. compulsion and peace-with-solitude vs. aching-connection tensions are clear, though they rarely collide in a single pressured moment. The emotional reactions are largely embodied and concrete (the flower against his palm, the vertigo, the jar of sea glass). The final choice to enshrine the boutonnière reads earned, if a touch smooth and unresisted.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, loyalty to Elara, and empirically driven curiosity all read as specific and coherent, and his final choice to accept rather than alter his life is well motivated. The map-dealer lens and his methodical patience (“with the patience of a glacier”) make his mindset feel lived-in. However, his temptation at the doorway is resolved very smoothly; we don’t see much active struggle between staying and stepping through, which slightly softens the felt cost of his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s disenchantment, yearning for escape, and sense of duty are all clearly motivated and consistently dramatized, especially in the reach-toward / recoil-from the starlight. Her internal conflict between obliteration and obligation is legible in micro-choices, not just stated. Kael is thinly sketched but serves as a focused relational pressure point at the brink. A few emotional summaries (“the disenchantment remained, a familiar ache”) lean abstract rather than embodied, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to capture “the density of presence”—is clear, particular, and drives every choice, and her shift from worshipping the nautilus to dropping it feels earned by Kael’s confession. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (the cold shell, the way the talisman suddenly feels “dead”), and the conflicting impulses between control and vulnerability play in scene. The relationship with Kael is economically but distinctly rendered, with the final gift functioning as both scientific success and farewell. The only minor weakness is that some realizations are told in fairly abstract terms rather than fully dramatized through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s jealousy, fear, and eventual awe are specific and embodied (“feral nostalgia,” “jealousy for the man who had that dream”), and the final shift from survival to artistry feels earned by the preceding interior struggle. The contradiction between resenting past selves and needing their memories is clear and drives his behavior. The main limitation is that his life beyond this cabin and vocation remains abstract, so his flaw set feels slightly narrow for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara is sharply realized: her anosmia, past as an aromatherapist, and new tactile “listening” cohere into a specific, embodied inner life. Her motivation—to find meaning after the loss of smell by “unveiling ordinary miracles”—credibly fuels her willingness to take on the man’s request. The old man is sketched efficiently but with enough depth (surgeon vs midwife worldview, old grief) to make his need legible. The final shift—Elara feeling “the extraordinary weight of what remained”—is earned, if a touch swift, but still arises from the scene’s concrete work.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s motivation—both to heal and to intellectually decode his affliction—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, especially the pivot from scholarly runes to grandmother’s superstition. His interiority is grounded in concrete sensations (the lattice of veins, the burning lungs) and credible academic habits of mind. The internal conflict between trained rationalism and dismissed folk wisdom is dramatized rather than summarized, and the final choice to “trace and name” feels earned. If anything, the resolution comes slightly easily emotionally; a bit more resistance or ambivalence at the moment of shift could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Julian’s motivation (an overdue apology before the orchard is destroyed) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and his embodied grief during the ritual feels specific and earned. The relationship with Elara is mostly conveyed through objects (music, perfume) rather than concrete shared memories, which slightly mutes the emotional specificity. Madame Vex has a sharp, distinct presence and her transactional-plus-curious motives are clean. The final shift to “acceptance” rather than full forgiveness feels plausible and appropriately costly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Witness has a clear, coherent motivation and inner life, but she functions more as an archetypal figure than a fully individuated person. Her spiral walk, reinterpretation of “arbitration,” and choice to surrender selfhood are motivated and aligned. However, there’s little sense of internal contradiction or emotional struggle as she approaches erasure, which softens the cost of the final act. The piece sacrifices psychological specificity for conceptual elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—his need to understand “what clocks really measure” threads cleanly through perception and choice. His embodied experience (the ritual counting, the breath cloud, the tactile key) grounds him beyond abstraction. The internal tension between engineer-shepherd (correct the flaw vs. witness it) is credible but remains relatively gentle, never quite pushed to a truly fraught dilemma. The final renunciation (not fixing the flaw) is earned but could carry a sharper felt cost to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivations (grief, need to “understand the physics of letting go”) are specific and tightly linked to his skills and choices, and his final act of release is clearly earned. Interiority is textured—his spatial perception and sensory focus feel character-particular rather than generic. The internal conflict between wanting reunion and wanting to honor the strangers’ passage is present but could surface more explicitly in the decision moment for maximal pressure. Overall, he reads as a coherent, individuated character with a credible emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris is sharply etched as a probability professor defined by her resistance to her father’s chaos, and her choices—to follow the cipher, to keep riding the trains, to light the lantern—are consistent with and test that identity. The interior conflict between statistical certainty and intuitive, risky following of patterns is clear and particular to her. The final understanding of her father feels earned by the subway “pilgrimage,” though the emotional turn to peace lands a bit quickly for the depth of lifetime damage implied.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is sharply etched—a deliberately obsolete “semantic engineer” whose cultivated estrangement and precise methods feel specific and consistent. His motivation (teaching endings how to begin) clearly governs his choices, and the caller’s shift in framing is credible. However, Silas’s interior conflict and emotional cost remain mostly conceptual (“necessary vacuum”) rather than embodied in a felt, contradictory impulse on the page, and the caller himself is more function than person.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply drawn—a meticulous, almost devotional archivist whose compulsion to “preserve the weight of small moments” credibly drives every choice, from attempting a risky restoration to walking to the jetty. Tomas is thinner but functional as a mirrored counterpart whose awe and research parallel hers. Motivation is clear and consistent, but we rarely see genuine inner contradiction or muddled impulse under pressure; she never has to choose between conflicting values. The final emotional stance feels earned, though somewhat tidy given the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is sharply etched: the disaster-relief background, the moon rock, and his engineered myth all cohere into a credible, lonely fixer. His motives (cure his own loneliness by catalyzing others’ connection) are specific and consistent, and his final choice to engage without using the rock feels earned. Internal contradiction—his manipulation versus his hunger for genuine contact—could surface more viscerally in the on-page moment with the crowd. Secondary characters are functional emblems of community rather than individuated pressures, which keeps the relational crucible somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s grief, sensory overload, and compulsion toward the Stillpoint are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized through touch and sound. His interiority feels particular (mapping through texture, hearing a C-sharp via a ring), not generic. The change at the end—shifting from craving silence to accepting harmony—feels earned by what we’ve seen of his coping mechanisms. The one limit is that his internal contradictions under pressure are more implied than actively dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s guilt, competence, and obsessive need to “thresh meaning” are specific and coherent, and his final renunciation feels credibly earned from the conflict between fixing and understanding. The interiority is textured—he’s neither melodramatic nor stoic—and his embodied reactions to the anomaly and the pen ground his emotions. The choice to send a footnote instead of an edit lands as a believable outgrowth of his arc, with real cost. I’d only nudge higher if his “confidently uncertain” nature created sharper, on-page contradiction during the peak editing attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation—“to translate silence into music”—is clear and consistently embodied in his ritual with the camera and signs. His interiority is particular rather than generic, and his embodied choices (where to point the camera, how his hands move) reveal him well. However, he moves through the piece with almost no visible internal contradiction or real doubt, which limits complexity. The final emotional state feels earned but relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to vindicate Elara and protect her work—reads clear and specific, and his shift from arsonist to curator is well earned by what he discovers. The interiority is textured (“tenderness so fierce it threatened to crack his ribs”) and embodied rather than purely labeled. Internal contradiction between rage and tenderness is present but could be dramatized more under immediate pressure rather than largely resolved into calm once the revelation lands. The final commitment to creation feels slightly tidy but still grounded in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim and manifest a shared dream in defiance of the treatment—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice from the escape to the drumming. Interiority is specific and embodied (“braided it into her marrow,” the feel of his hand, the tear) rather than generic grief-labeling. However, internal conflict is relatively one-note: there’s little sense of competing impulses (fear vs defiance, desire for numbness vs pain) that might complicate her rebellion. The final endurance feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is sharply etched—a quiet, hyper-competent maintenance worker with a distinctive sensibility—and Kaelen’s bluster sets up a clear status dynamic. Motivation is coherent (proving the value of “whispers”) and matched to his tactics and restraint at the end. However, Silas borders on frictionless competence, with little visible doubt, fatigue, or internal conflict as he solves the problem. The lack of on-page struggle or contradictory impulses keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation and function are clear and particular, and their empathy for the canal’s sorrow is effectively embodied in their choices and tools. However, they encounter little visible internal conflict or contradiction; their calm competence is never seriously strained. The resulting arc reads more as graceful execution of a role than as a pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—his aim “to plant forests of second thoughts” feels character-specific, not generic rebellion. His ability to hear unspoken words usefully externalizes his empathy and anxiety. Internal contradiction is mild (he’s consistently sure of his path, with little visible fear or doubt about consequences), which slightly flattens pressure. Still, his choices and perceptions earn the small but real shift at the end with Maya.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s restlessness and grace, contrasted with his life of hauling nets, are cleanly motivated, and Elara’s “combative tenderness” comes through in both posture and speech. The sibling relationship credibly drives the core choice, especially in her late acceptance on the shore. However, Kaelen’s internal conflict feels under-pressured—he never seriously doubts or falters—so his departure reads more like an inevitable fulfillment than a hard-won decision. Emotional embodiment is solid but could use one more moment of genuine struggle or contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific: the curated blank face, theatrical self-narration, and private whittling all reveal a complex blend of guilt, self-preservation, and longing for grief. His moral ambiguity around Mara (“he had simply watched”) gives his coping rituals teeth rather than purity. The final act of placing the bird in Mara’s bouquet feels like an earned, costly endurance rather than an easy catharsis. A slightly deeper, concrete glimpse of his history with Mara might further sharpen the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s aesthetic motivation and boundary-obsession are clear and coherent, and his interiority is sensorially grounded rather than summarized. His choice to dissolve himself into the hum and his subsequent reorientation toward a “mission” read as earned from what we’ve seen. Internal conflict is present but mild; he rarely feels genuinely torn or at risk, which slightly flattens the emotional range. The final state change (from seeker of mystery to interpreter/bridge) is credible but comes with only a soft, largely abstracted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian is distinct and motivated, with his colorblind perception and creed of “beauty in imperfection” coherently driving his choices, and Vex’s desperation is legible in a few efficient strokes. His role as problem-solver via pattern-recognition is well dramatized. However, internal contradiction is only lightly touched—his “innocently cunning” nature never meets a sharp moral or emotional snag, and Lyra herself remains more symbol than person. The final sense of this being his “masterpiece” works, but it doesn’t cost him anything visible beyond effort and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation (recovering the lost frequency of connection) is clear, consistent, and drives all his choices, and his competence feels grounded in his role and environment. However, his interior life is somewhat idealized and one-note—patient, reverent, gentle—without much contradiction or sharp edge. The story hints at cost in his solitude and long effort, but that cost isn’t made emotionally specific on the page. The final shift reads as fulfillment more than a conflicted or costly change in him.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief, craft background, and shift from isolation to mentorship are well-motivated and embodied (“Grief had been a smith…”; the forge at the end). His choice to help the woman via indirect, almost ritualistic contact feels specific to his temperament and history and culminates in the projector scene with credible emotional cost. The woman is sketched effectively through posture and small reactions, but her interiority remains relatively thin, which slightly flattens the relational crucible. Internal contradiction in Elias (his lingering attachment to Anya vs. his new purpose) could be sharpened in on-page moments of hesitation or fear to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara feels specific and motivated, with the engineer father and the tape giving her an unusual psychology; Julian is thinner but serviceable as a foil. Her obsession with structural failures is clear and coherent with her actions. However, we mostly see her in confident explanatory mode, with little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost on the page. The final beat hints at burden but doesn’t quite dramatize an internal conflict or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—her long obsession, scholarly pride, and willingness to pay the cost are all clearly dramatized. The moment where foreign memories become “pure and potent” and she feels “anguished joy” embodies a strong, character-particular conflict. However, contradictory impulses under peak pressure could be sharpened; she rarely wavers or missteps, so the final self-sacrifice feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won. The arc from detached scholar to haunted vessel is convincing but could use one more embodied moment of reluctance or self-deception to be fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—saving Elara’s full, flawed self—is clear, particular, and consistently drives his choices, especially the decision to integrate rather than excise the shadow. His interiority feels lived-in (“a love that had outlived its object”), and his professional competence is balanced by emotional vulnerability. The relationship dynamic is richly evoked through his engagement with her archive rather than direct interaction, which works at this length. Internal contradiction (wanting to protect her while refusing to sanitize her suffering) is present, though it could be sharpened with one more moment of doubt or temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured—his anger, shame, and care for the chameleon coexist on the page, especially in the “shedding layers” passage. His motivation (heal the animal / salvage his self-respect without hardening) is clear and consistently enacted. The final realization about compassion grows plausibly from the work he does and the trust the animal offers him. A slight tilt toward abstract labeling of his emotional state in a few lines keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation is vivid and particular—“to learn to read the stories in scars”—and the procedure’s failure sharpens his contradiction between seeking closure and compulsively reopening wounds. His interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (the “returning geography” of pain, the way he reads coffee rings), not generic angst. The final endurance stance—accepting himself as a “quiet, lonely archivist”—is earned by the preceding vision of the preserved break and the ivy’s panic. A slightly clearer sense of his life beyond this ritual (other people, obligations) could deepen cost even further.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation (“to find where unused love is stored”) is clear and particular, and her interiority—especially the way she experiences the booth’s silence and the psychometric vision—feels individuated rather than generic. Arthur, though accessed only through her, also reads as a specific, lonely man with a ritualized, idiosyncratic way of handling his unspent love. The main limitation is that Elara’s internal conflict isn’t really dramatized as a tension between competing impulses; once she starts the reading, there’s little sense of risk or ambivalence about getting her answer. Her final, quiet renunciation of further search is credible but could land with more felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation (escape the psychic noise to recover her creativity) is clear and consistent, and her nightly ritual plus final shift to drawing show concrete, character-driven choices. The epiphany about “remembered stardust” grows plausibly from her obsessive star-tracing, though the speed and totality of her new understanding verge on convenience. Interiority is specific and sensory rather than generic, but we see more single-direction yearning than active internal contradiction under pressure. The final rest-as-harmony feels earned, though the cost of her new stance (continuing to bear the noise) could be shaded more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s role, temperament, and core value (cultivating fragile possibilities rather than erasing them) are clear and consistently dramatized in the central decision to synthesize pine and sand. The internal conflict between protecting the present and honoring the past is present but understated, handled more as conceptual stance than felt contradiction moment to moment. Embodied emotion is there in flashes (“violent intrusion,” “phantom limb aching”) but remains largely filtered through an abstract, cerebral register. The final stirring of something “like the beginning of a dream” is earned but could land even harder with slightly more textured ambivalence earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is specific and textured, with his habits (thumb on the worn gear, parsing wind “dialects”) grounding him as more than a generic mystic. Motivation—to understand the logic behind his translocations and his own mind—is clear and consistently pursued through concrete micro-choices (following an unfamiliar sound, submitting to the “hum of insight”). The main weakness is that his final acceptance and reframing come a bit too smoothly, with limited visible ambivalence or cost in the climactic moment. A touch more simultaneous dread or resistance would make the transformation feel fully earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—the broken “leash” and her quest for unused courage—is clear, consistent, and carried through to the end. Her emotional life is rendered mostly through image and atmosphere rather than specific, idiosyncratic contradiction, so internal conflict feels a bit too tidy. The final realization about courage as a “muscle to be flexed” is earned but leans toward thematic neatness more than messy human ambivalence. The guides function as calm catalysts rather than real relational pressure, keeping characterization luminous but slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt, need for safety, and refusal to flee are deeply rooted and consistent, with the bolt and the staircase concretizing his inner conflict. His “unpardable silence” is a specific, character-particular flaw that drives every choice. The relationship with the soloist is powerful but remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric rather than dramatized between two active presences on the page. His final act with the bolt and his decision to stay feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation (restoring balance rather than seeking vengeance) is clear and consistent, and his ritual choices all track back to that aim. However, he reads as serenely competent rather than internally conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real emotional degradation under pressure. His dissolution at the end is moving conceptually but not deeply felt because his interior cost is mostly implied rather than embodied. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation—grief over the reef and Lena, and obsessive need to solve her last riddle—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his nightly tapping and data work. The "prison and sanctuary" paradox, plus his split between official duty and secret project, gives him dimensionality. His emotional life is present but somewhat smoothed; we glimpse obsession more than we feel him truly fraying under it. A slightly sharper sense of what this costs him (psychologically or practically) would push the characterization higher.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to find meaning and reignite the rebellion) is clear, embodied, and consistently expressed through concrete choices (barefoot in the graveyard, months practicing the note, aligning the stones). Her emotional texture—awkward yet purposeful, then settling into earned confidence during the hum—is persuasive. What’s missing at this tier is sharper internal conflict or visible doubt under pressure; success feels anticipated rather than wrestled from fear or competing impulses. The arc from caretaker to effective catalyst is credible but a bit too frictionless to reach higher.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear, specific, and consistent—her commitment to “evolve tradition with intent” credibly drives every choice. Her interiority feels particular (the plant-telepathy as perception, her distrust of the reconstruction), but we rarely see genuine inner contradiction or fear of the cost; she reads more as serenely competent than torn. Embodied emotion is present but muted—this feels like ritual mastery rather than a pressured gamble. The final stance (she plants a seed rather than topples the system) is earned but could land harder if weighed against a more visceral sense of risk or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific: the freeze response, the photograph’s worn texture, and the “pearl of stillness” technique show a person with history and adaptive tactics rather than a generic traumatized figure. Her contradictory impulses—to freeze, to flee, to ground herself, to return to tending the pine—coexist convincingly in the same moment. The final choice to resume work with “just enough” water reads as an Earned Stasis aligned with her traits and coping style. A minor ding: phrases like “It wasn't about forgetting or forgiving” edge toward explanatory gloss rather than purely dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific, from his perceptual fragmentation (“only a constellation of disconnected features”) to his grim humor with the tarot box. His motivation—self-imposed descent into darkness to understand his collapse—is clear and consistent with his actions. The final re-identification as “cartographer of the fractured soul” feels earned, not tacked on. The one limit is that his internal conflict could sharpen slightly; his doubts and drives generally cohere rather than truly clash on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined—his “serene anger” and choice to abandon the rescue efforts for a more abstract hunt read as specific, even ruthless. His interiority is concrete and consistent, and his skills as a tracker are tied to how he reads the ink. Internal contradiction is weaker: ignoring “the shouts of his kin” barely troubles him, so we miss a richer conflict between communal obligation and obsession. The change at the end (choosing disappearance) is credible and earned but leans more on pre-existing drive than on an escalated inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—preservation versus exposing a foundational lie—and her internal conflict is convincingly layered rather than binary. Lines like “a schism running through the core of her professional vows and her personal conscience” concretely frame the stakes of her choice. Her actions (seeking the old terminal, sending the packet) align cleanly with that inner struggle. A few emotion labels (“bravely conflicted”) verge on summary rather than embodied contradiction, keeping this just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivations and values are sharply etched: her plant work as “quiet rebellion” sets up the conflict with her father’s legacy, and the knife beat crystallizes that tension. Contradictory impulses (heritage vs. chosen peace) are live in the moment she grips the hilt. The father is more sketched than dramatized, but the sketch is precise enough for this length. The final renunciation/containment of the weapon feels fully earned by prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation and temperament are clear and coherent—the “cool-headed fisher” whose singular aim is to catch the goddess’s echo—and his actions align with this throughout. Interiority is vivid in a sensory way (pressure behind eyes, hollowness in chest) and his unique ability is dramatized rather than told. However, he lacks genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; he meets enormous cosmic stakes with near-total equanimity, which flattens emotional complexity. The ending suggests endurance rather than change, but the cost to him remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste’s motivation—protecting her father’s true legacy while pursuing truth—is clear and drives every beat, and her perception of her father (the rain flinch, avoiding April) feels specific and human. Her analytic, almost mathematical temperament makes the “proof by contradiction” gambit feel character-true. Internal conflict (truth vs. filial loyalty) is more implied than really dramatized in-scene, keeping this just short of exceptional depth. The journalist is thinly drawn but functional as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s guilt, ritualized through tattooing, is specific and embodied (“his needle a whisper against skin,” “guilt was a low-frequency hum”), and his drive to “hush” that hum motivates each major choice. The father–child bond is efficiently but powerfully evoked through the letters and the translated cries. Internal contradiction (his urge to preserve vs. release Lyra) is present but could surface more overtly in the climactic scene, where he moves to solve the problem without much on-page hesitation. Still, the final choice to tether and let go reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and specific—chalk nebulae, paint-stained fingers, a preference for whimsy over despair—so her choice to create a mandala instead of speaking feels well motivated. Her social perception is dramatized in how she reads other wanderers’ bodies and redirects her tactic accordingly. Internal contradiction (whimsy vs unease, hope vs the oppressive hush) is present but stays largely conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in on-page micro-conflict. Secondary figures remain atmospheric rather than individuated, so relational pressure is more implied than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s characterization as a calm, gentle, almost clinical radical is clear, with embodied hints of cost (“the echoes of all the minds he had touched”) grounding him beyond trope. His motivation—to end suffering through erasure—aligns cleanly with all his actions, and the final recommitment to his work feels earned. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; he never truly wavers or struggles on the page with the ethics of what he’s doing. The Retro functions mostly as an object of care rather than a fully realized counter-presence, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Julian’s theatrical, encore-seeking drive is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his choices of what echoes to summon. Elara’s despair is convincingly embodied in her posture and reaction to the sensations, but the cause and texture of her crisis remain vague, which softens the felt cost of her change. The final shift—her decision not to flip the coin and to walk out with renewed purpose—feels earned by Julian’s intervention, though her own inner contradiction is only lightly sketched. Overall, motivation is strong for the ghost, slightly underdeveloped for the living character.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—affectionate skeptic vs. longing to believe—feels specific and embodied, and his eventual choice to “meet her halfway” is well earned. Lena’s belief and vulnerability land through small actions (clutching the geode, her reaction to the images) rather than labels. The final hand-clasp convincingly reconfigures their relationship without pretending his skepticism simply vanishes. A slight tendency toward explicit labeling (“affectionate skeptic to his core”) keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, ritual with the fossil, and drive “to become the voice of the unknown” create a specific, coherent interiority, and her choice to surrender analytic control and merge with the cave is well-motivated. However, her emotional life remains mostly single-note curiosity/awe, with little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. The final shift—from abstract goal to concrete role as “first speaker”—is clear but not heavily costed. Adding a moment of real hesitation or fear before she opens herself would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s vocation and underlying rebellion are sharply etched, and his final refusal to turn the hourglass is well motivated by the accumulated work with the buttons and jar. Interiority is particular—his focus on “tiny, discarded decisions” gives him a distinct cast of mind. However, his internal conflict is largely inferred rather than dramatized in the peak moment; we don’t quite feel him wrestle before walking past the clock. The cost of his choice (personal, social) is conceptually strong but could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, hesitancy, and hunger for redemption are specific and embodied (Vienna alley, the pillbox, his careful use of the snow code) and his final decision to go after her feels earned. The internal conflict between fear/self-loathing and the pull of obligation is present, though it could bite a little harder in-scene. Kestrel functions well as a foil—cautious, world-weary—but remains more tool than fully realized character. The closing stance—measured resolve rather than frantic flight—credibly forecloses his prior avoidance at a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is sharply etched: a weary, dutiful coachman whose guilt, resignation, and quiet compassion all coexist on the page. His interior conflict over the broken promise to Anya is specific and embodied in concrete actions (handling the needle, listening to the river) rather than generic brooding. The final easing of the “knot” of the promise feels earned by the preceding layers of memory and reflection. The only limiter is that no external relationship is on-page to press him further under live interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—“to understand why some places resist change”—is clear, consistent, and embodied in his methodical, reverent choices (tracking sunlight, watering the rose, rebuilding the channel). His vocation and temperament are specific and integrated: the clay detail and “potter’s intuition” feel character-particular rather than generic mysticism. The main limitation is the relative absence of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he moves through the story with calm alignment rather than tension. The final change (folding his own care into the oasis’s memory) is earned but emotionally understated, costing some depth.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to “reflect light into dark corners,” inherited from her locksmith father—is specific, rooted in history, and cleanly drives every choice, especially the indirectness of her nightly ritual. Her emotional life is embodied through concrete perceptions (the last petal, the cold air, the weight of the line) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she longs to reach out yet refuses direct contact, which reads as a believable, costly limit rather than a loophole. The endurance at the end (continuing the oar-stroke rhythm after the small response) feels like an earned, character-consistent stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—his shift from seeing solitude as a cage to seeing himself as a “reservoir” feels earned by the preceding pressure. The brittle awakenings, fear of madness, and choice to approach the forbidden heart of the library all track well with his traits. Embodiment is mostly good (salt on the wind, coarse fur, vibrations through bone), though some emotions are conveyed more abstractly than viscerally. The final stance is credible but leans a bit tidy, with little lingering contradiction or moral messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and coherent, with her work as a ghostwriter plausibly fraying her own emotional life and motivating her reluctance to surrender the nest. The central contradiction—needing connection yet clinging to the last tangible symbol of it—is dramatized well in the decision to add the spiral to the installation. The final shift from archivist to participant feels earned by the accumulated reflection. There could be slightly more mess or ambivalence in the closing beat to avoid the feeling of a wholly tidy emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is specific and coherent: a solitary, technically skilled night worker whose preference for “dying stars” over people concretizes her temperament. Her motivation to outwit the tricksters is well-rooted in both professional pride and moral horror at the social fracture, and the dread/hope tension feels earned. However, her internal conflict is relatively clean—once we enter the scene, the moral decision is already effectively made, so we miss a more acutely dramatized moment where contradictory impulses clash on the page. The cost to her remains largely emotional fatigue and an open-ended future burden rather than a sharper personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s fear of enclosed spaces versus his compulsion to honor his great-grandfather gives him a clear, specific contradiction that plays through the scene. His interiority is mostly embodied (“tightening in his chest,” urge to scream) rather than abstractly labeled. The final choice to stand his ground and use the compass feels motivated by prior journal knowledge and his quiet rebellion against forgetting. I’d push higher if we saw one more sharp, irrational beat of terror-driven temptation to give up or flee before he acts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, particular, and compelling: he’s not seeking justice but trying to awaken a capacity for empathy his condition has starved. His interiority is well-rendered through how he reads the quarry, the mist, and the ribbon, and his final ache feels earned rather than proclaimed. The internal contradiction—selfish motive in a “tragic” context—could be sharpened with more friction or resistance during the process, as his breakthrough comes a bit smoothly. Still, his actions track convincingly with his traits and aim.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—vindicating Eva and refusing to accept the Guild’s version—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. His “nervous confidence” and the way dread and idealism coexist give him dimension, though his internal conflict never quite forces a truly fraught trade-off. The blood-descendant/key condition personalizes the stakes effectively. The final shift from nervousness to clean confidence is earned but a shade too tidy to feel fully costly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular—his history of being told “never” and his bridge-songs give him texture and plausibility. His emotional progression from shaken disbelief to tentative resolve is coherent and motivated by what he witnesses. However, his shift carries little visible resistance or contradiction; we don’t see competing impulses contest his final choice in the moment. The closure choice (to play the mesh’s rhythm) feels earned but not deeply costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his lineage, inheritance, and chosen tactics all cohere into a clear psychology, especially in contrast to his father and the CEO. His calm, observant nature informs concrete choices (markers instead of violence), and the final renunciatory understanding feels earned. However, internal contradiction is mostly implicit; we don’t deeply feel him tempted by his father’s methods on the page, which slightly flattens the conflict. Secondary characters (especially the CEO) are functional rather than deeply characterized, though that suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s obsession, weariness, and inherited burden are well-motivated and consistent, and his occupation meaningfully colors his perceptions. His emotional life is embodied through concrete details (the eyepiece’s cold copper, the brittle telegram) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is relatively muted: once he commits to this “last resort,” there’s little dramatized push–pull between giving up and trying again. The final shift to calm feels earned but somewhat linear, not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guardedness, grief, and disciplined serenity feel specific and consistent, and her micro-choices in the ritual (pushing deeper despite psychic pain, planting the seed at the end) are clearly motivated. The internal contradiction—her need to know versus her self-protective walls—emerges most strongly when “her own guarded nature [is] cracking” as she unbends the branch. Emotional states are mostly embodied rather than labeled, though some reactions (e.g., “warlike serenity”) read a bit conceptual. The final softening of her guard is earned by the struggle through the vortex and the nature of the confession.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—her fixation on re-knitting the frayed timeline, her root-bound limitation, and her bond with Kael feel specific rather than generic. Emotional states are embodied through imagery (sap-slowed blood, scars as cartography) rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses under pressure (e.g., doubt vs conviction) are more implied than dramatized, and the cost of her final act is conceptually large but not felt as a personal sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in guilt and love, and his actions—seeking non-violent ways to “fill” the void—track tightly with that motive. Interiority is vivid and particular (“soil and sorrow,” the remembered academy acceptance) and his choice to give up a cherished memory feels like an earned, costly extension of his established flaw (reckless idealism). Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened; we see panic vs. resolve, but not a deep temptation to choose an easier, more selfish path. Still, by the end his reframing of the burned card as “guard stone” reads as a credible, bittersweet endurance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn through occupational detail, sensory bias, and the contrast between his past as a roadie and current appraiser. His core contradiction—“confidently uncertain,” expert with objects but inept with his own feelings—is dramatized in the struggle with the cloth and recorder. The final choice to keep the scrap on the desk instead of cataloging it reads as a credible, modest but meaningful stance shift with cost (abandoning pure detachment). Slightly more on-page friction between his insulating “facts” impulse and the emergent vulnerability in the present would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief, intellectual rigor, and translator mindset are clear and specific, especially in how she reframes death as a “problem of translation.” However, her internal conflict feels relatively smoothed over: there’s little on-page resistance or self-sabotage as she shifts from haunted loss to illuminated acceptance, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. Micro-choices (where to plant, how to tend, speaking cuneiform to the seed) are well aligned with her motives. The final reconfiguration of her ambition is earned but could carry more visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelan’s dual roles as Archivist and Smelter create a credible internal contradiction, and their motivation to “preserve wonder in routine” is clear and consistent. However, they read more as an archetypal function than a fully individuated person; emotional experience is described conceptually (“empathetic heat”) rather than with concrete, character-particular interiority. The choice to endure pain to smelt the memories is strong but never feels truly pressured or in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s conflict between professional duty and his yearning to end isolation is cleanly established and convincingly drives the final choice. Interiority is vivid and particular (“transfusion of pure yearning”), and his hesitation at the crystal nicely crystallizes contradictory impulses. The main limitation is that his history and specific losses remain abstract, so the cost feels more conceptual than wounds-deep. Still, the final act reads as an earned, character-driven renunciation with a real (if largely implied) price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motives and history are clear and coherent, and his grief is embodied through concrete choices like hauling the accordion and fixating on map references. The internal shift—from believing guilt is locatable in geography to realizing his agency in “drawing the lines”—is earned by what we’ve seen. There is some abstraction and light therapy-lexicon (“desperate logic of the un-numbed”) that nudges the voice toward authorial rather than character-bound. Still, his final renunciation (leaving the accordion) carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—averting the finality of the second letter by decoding his silence—is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices in the library (when to move, what to capture) align with that drive. We get a credible sense of her emotional state (desperate, tremulous, cautiously elated) via embodied detail like her trembling fingers. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a stronger sense of contradiction or internal friction; she rarely seems truly torn between options. The closing endurance—choosing to face the dawn with this new knowledge—lands but could carry more visible inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his roles as provenance researcher, secret telepath, and coffee-diviner all cohering into a clear psychology. The central contradiction—career complicity vs. yearning for a “world that breathes”—is dramatized rather than stated, especially in the plant memory/coffee prophecy convergence. His final treasonous act (cutting the vine, telling the truth, walking away) is well-earned by prior beats. The only limiting factor is the absence of any on-page relational crucible or opposition that might further pressure his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and her actions align tightly with her “beautician mortician” profession. However, she experiences almost no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her competence is untroubled and untested. The result is a beautifully rendered functionary rather than a fully pressured individual. The ending offers endurance of duty rather than a felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and inner life are clear, specific, and consistent, from her history of forgiveness to her impulse to intervene. Her micro-choices (climbing to think, reframing the problem, breaking with tradition) feel rooted in character. The one softness is the relative tidiness of the concluding realization, which edges toward smooth epiphany rather than fully conflicted ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s role as a professional conscience and Kaelen’s fraying certainty are sharply drawn, with concrete cues like the tremor in his hand and the fumbling at the cloak clasp. Motivation is clean and specific—Kaelen wants righteous revenge but can no longer fully believe in it; the narrator wants to sell doubt rather than verdicts. The internal conflict in Kaelen is mostly signaled rather than deeply layered on the page, but the decisive relinquishing of the cloak feels earned. The relationship dynamic—priest/confessor tilted into mercenary/cliente—is legible and shifts subtly by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s impatience and grief over his sister are clear and consistently embodied, and Elara’s backward life plus pedagogical severity give her a distinct, compelling presence. His realization at the end is well-motivated by what he sees in the pond rather than feeling arbitrarily bestowed. Internal contradiction (his need to cling vs the necessity of letting go) is present but could be dramatized more viscerally instead of explained in conceptual terms. The relationship dynamic—her withholding as a deliberate cruelty/mercy—nicely serves as the crucible for his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelan’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—patient, reverent, driven by a long-term spiritual goal. However, interior contradiction is light; we don’t see them wrestle with any serious doubt or temptation to violate their reverence, so key choices feel almost frictionless. The final act of guiding the pulse lands as gentle competence rather than a hard-won, costly decision. This keeps the character compelling but short of fully three-dimensional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s underachievement, misalignment with his era, and quiet longing for “the sacred in the simple” are all clearly motivated and consistently dramatized. The key turn—shedding the pack and choosing feel over algorithm—emerges credibly from his frustration and self-doubt. Interiority is specific enough (“a poet forced to write legal code”) to individuate him rather than read as stock. The epiphany edges toward tidy, but it’s earned by prior pressure and doesn’t feel unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas’s mix of rationalization (“This wasn't about grief; it was about physics”) and private pilgrimage is specific and convincing, and his internal contradiction is carried through the dive to the quiet fulfillment of his vow. His grief, competence, and self-deception all feel embodied in his actions and perceptions rather than summarized. The shift from hollow routine to a genuinely reconfigured inner state at the end reads earned, though a slightly sharper sense of his ongoing flaw or future cost could deepen the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s motivation and inner conflict are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized, particularly in his tension between “prophet” and “madman” as he risks the station’s sensors. The cast-lots philosophy and coin ritual externalize his doubt and faith in a character-particular way. His final reorientation—from seeker of the new universe’s will to curator of the old—feels earned by everything we’ve seen. A bit of opening exposition (“His motivation was simple, if esoteric”) leans tell-y, but it doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s grief, guilt, and need to shape his pain into something nameable are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his choices (replaying Elara’s voice, attempting an unprecedented act as a reaper). The internal contradiction—duty-bound “silent witness” versus someone who cannot accept erasure—comes through without being over-explained. His final act of creating and naming “Elara’s Echo” reads as an earned stance rather than a pat epiphany. The only mild limitation is that we see only one mode of him under pressure, so his complexity is strongly implied rather than fully stress-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation—to wake a sleeping world despite being “lukewarm”—is specific, consistent, and carries cleanly into the closing image. The brittle tension between his sense of futility and his stubborn return each morning gives him dimensionality rather than mere saintliness. His exhaustion and small, almost private smile at the end embody cost and relief without over-explaining. Internal contradiction could be sharpened further on the page in the climactic moment (more visible doubt or temptation to quit), but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives are clear and specific—professional vigilance giving way to a personal need to redress a family (and civic) wrong—and his final choice at the ledger is well earned. The grandfather and great-uncle are sharply sketched through selective detail and implication rather than exposition, which deepens the emotional stakes. The internal conflict between reverence for his grandfather and the obligation to correct the lie is present, though it could be embodied a bit more viscerally. The closing stance—calmly public, quietly revisionary—feels like a credible evolution of the man we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (to reconcile logic and intuition) is clear, consistent, and strongly tied to his professional identity and secret sentimentality. The locket/edelweiss reveal nicely complicates his self-concept and leads organically to the realization that “reverence” is the missing element. His interiority is concrete and particular, though the emotional progression toward wonder is slightly tidy and avoids much irrational resistance. The change at the end feels earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s sense of duty, past near-death, and present anxiety under pressure are clear and embodied (“like a man underwater,” his hand trembling at the dial). His motivation—to preserve the trust of those below—is coherent and drives every choice. The internal conflict between fear and obligation surfaces credibly in the parachute memory beat. The arc is small but earned: he moves from overwhelmed and shaken to steady, at a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation—quiet curiosity to puncture his numbness—is clear and drives his choice to defy Jin and vivify the brain, with the final “terrifying sense of responsibility” reading as an earned shift. His ego-death and emotional flatness feel specific rather than generic depression, and his use of remembered love vs present void is a concrete contradiction. Jin is sketched economically but effectively as fearful traditionalist, and the fear Kael perceives in him is nicely used. The only limitation is that Kael’s internal struggle in the moment of choosing to proceed over Jin’s objection could be textured with slightly more embodied hesitation or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated—a puzzle-maker whose curiosity and respect for process drive him to treat the seed as an invitation rather than a threat—and his actions align well with that temperament. Interiority is specific (the shift from "direct assault" to "orthogonal approaches" feels character-driven), and his occupation informs how he thinks. However, there’s very little genuine internal conflict or sense of risk around planting a bizarre corpse-flower seed; the choice feels thoughtful but not hard. A touch more ambivalence or visible cost would deepen the final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ghost-husband’s motivation is clear and specific, and his “mournfully eager” temperament is consistently embodied in his persistence with the blower. The constraint of not being able to touch or speak drives a concrete, character-particular tactic rather than generic ghostliness. The wife gets a small but credible emotional turn from flinch to fragile smile. Depth of contradiction and flaw is somewhat limited for top-tier literary work, but what’s here is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyel’s interiority is specific and textured—“interiorizing exteriors,” “dimensionally homesick”—and his final renunciation is well-earned by earlier beats of ache, vigilance, and patience. The competing pulls of homesickness vs. fidelity to his post are dramatized clearly in the portal scene. Emotional embodiment is generally strong (ache, cold, fog) though occasionally phrased at a slightly abstract register (“make friends with uncertainty”). The result is a vivid, coherent character with one or two lines that feel a bit like thematic labeling rather than fully dramatized feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to escape a stifling, belittling destiny) is clear from the outset and his actions—methodical, self-wounding experimentation—track tightly with that drive. The stoic exterior vs “frantic sensitivity” interior is consistently rendered, especially in his reaction to each failure and the care with which he handles the crozier. His final shift from command to surrender is credibly earned by prior frustration and self-recognition (“He had been acting like the very Guildmasters he despised”). The only ceiling is that his contradictions and flaws, while strong for this length, don’t reach the richest possible psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, philosophy, and immediate frustration are clear and specific, and her micro-choices (using the fragment differently, widening channels, inverting gain) align with those motives. The “find the beginning in every ending” drive coheres well with her response to the shard of hush. However, internal contradiction and emotional cost remain relatively light, with little sense of flaw-driven missteps or real risk beyond professional disappointment. The final shift feels more like a clean, satisfying leveling-up than a change that meaningfully costs her anything.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Finn’s characterization as a resilient, quietly observant deckhand is clear, and his choice to act while everyone else is catatonic is well-motivated and consistent. The moment of “sudden, terrifying clarity” about the seam between timelines credibly drives his shift from survival to repair. Internal contradiction is present but light—there’s brief terror versus responsibility rather than a deeply knotted conflict. His final sense of being “a sailor forever caught between shores” gives a modest but convincing arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s obsessive, meticulous drive and “unsettling calm” read as coherent and specific, and his micro-choices (accepting the altered memory, weaving it into the core) feel motivated by that drive. The emotional progression from calm to frantic intensity to hollowed calm is believable. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened (he rarely resists or questions his own project, so conflict is more thematic than psychological). The final state—accepting his cage—is earned but might land even harder with one sharper moment of hesitation or doubt earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent: a professional navigator compelled to expand his craft into space, with career risk and spiritual hunger intertwined. His interiority has some nuance (pragmatism vs visionary impulse, “balancedly curious” vs “folly”), but the internal conflict never comes under real on-page pressure—his decision to confront the council feels relatively untormented. Secondary characters, especially Valerius and the council, function more as institutional voices than as individuated pressures. The final stance—“first link in a new chain”—is earned conceptually but would feel richer if his choice clearly cost him something personal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched—a “technician of sorrow” whose quiet competence and refusal of accolades feel specific and consistent with his actions. His motivation to answer the call and close the circuit is clear and drives every beat, even if his interior contradictions remain mostly implied rather than dramatized. Leo’s conflict (“failing at everything she hoped for me”) is potent but compressed, with limited on-page complexity beyond shame and relief. The final assurance and fading signal create a credible, earned emotional shift for both, though not a deeply conflicted one.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to honor and release the “unremembered,” especially his grandmother—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. His embodied fear of tight spaces is specific and paid off in the collapse moment, though “the cold sweat of his claustrophobia” leans on label rather than fully dramatized contradiction between urge to flee and need to proceed. The final emotional opening of his chest feels earned, not sentimental. A deeper tangle between duty and self-preservation could push this to a more complex, elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is specific, with the death-certificate error, heartbeat counting, and her role as caretaker of a “digital ghost” giving her a distinct identity and motive. Her choices—staying, performing the ink ritual for hours, and then reinterpreting her own existence—track cleanly from those motives. The arc from feeling like a clerical ghost to embracing the “space with its own unique potential” is believable and earned. What’s missing for a higher score is more in-scene contradiction or fraying under pressure; she stays almost serenely composed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive—to rescue a dying language by translating texture into sound—is vivid and consistent, and his copper-veined body perception nicely individualizes him. Interiority is concrete and particular, though largely aligned rather than conflicted; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses in the climactic action. His key choice (to climb, to align the diamond at that specific moment) feels motivated by years of obsession and the sight of the flock’s pattern. The emotional cost is more implied responsibility than dramatized turmoil, which keeps this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Julian’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in grief over Clara and allegiance to his organization, and the pivot from “expose the monster” to “protect this place” feels earned by what he witnesses. His interiority is textured and particular (“placid, unnerving silence of a forest after a fire”; “my bitterness had craved a simple villain”), not stock grief. The moment where he picks up both phone and arrowhead, then sets them down, crystallizes a credible internal contradiction between the pull toward transformation and his new understanding of what Clara chose. The only minor limitation is that his revaluation of his own “cosmically stupid” bitterness happens quickly for this depth of misbelief, though it still reads as plausible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently tied to her actions (reawakening beauty in a mechanized world), and her embodied fear/hope in the climax reads credibly. The interiority is vivid but relatively straightforward—there’s little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine moral ambiguity under pressure. Her final understanding grows organically from her experiment-driven method. The arc feels earned but not deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s core motive (“to find where broken promises heal”) is clear and his actions align with it, and the quiet sense of duty comes through convincingly. However, he remains largely steady and competent under pressure, with minimal on-page internal contradiction or fraying, which keeps him from feeling fully three-dimensional at this length. The cost to him is more implied than dramatized, so his endurance at the end reads earned but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—retreating from a loud world to restore the train and “interpret silence as possibility”—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his work. His emotional life comes through in tactile choices (hanging bells, crowning the mare, finally singing), though internal contradiction under pressure is relatively gentle rather than sharply contested. The decade of silence versus the impulse to sing is compelling but underexplored as a live, resisted fear in the peak beat. This keeps the arc moving and credible, but shy of truly searing interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific, and his meticulous, solitary temperament comes through in his actions and perceptions. The “sanely eccentric” quality is well dramatized via his ritualistic use of the books and scarf rather than left as a label. However, we get limited contradictory impulses or felt risk; he is almost entirely composed and sure, which flattens internal conflict. The other patrons are effectively atmospheric but do not become meaningful relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s obsession and quiet loneliness are clear and textured, with his ritualized behavior and hollowed-out days doing strong character work, but we rarely feel simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—he never meaningfully wavers, doubts, or resents the chase on the page. The closure (contentment in the presence of the manifested dream) is earned but the cost of years of obsession stays mostly implied rather than freshly dramatized at the end. Interiority is delivered through imagery and ritual rather than explicit thought, which suits the tone but slightly mutes emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Locksmith’s motivation is clear and particular—his belief that ideas are living things and must be freed gives him a specific ethical frame. However, he reads more as a mythic functionary than a fully individuated person with contradictions or blind spots. The grieving mother is mostly emblematic; her grief is credible but sketched. The emotional change at the end (her shift from grief to awe) lands, but without much layered interior conflict on the way.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation (recovering lost childhood memories) is clear, consistent, and credibly obsessive over decades, and his professional identity as a hands-on folklorist feels specific rather than generic. The internal conflict between his rule of non-interference and his desperate need to know is well dramatized in the choice to touch the mushroom. Emotions are mostly embodied through sensory recall and physical action, not abstract labels. The cost of his choice is more implied than fully felt on the page, which keeps this just shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael and Elara are sharply etched, with clear, specific traits (his backward-walking, her painstaking knot work) and a credible, fraught mentorship dynamic. Elara’s final choice to rebuild the scroll stack instead of rushing for the “path” is an earned stance shift grounded in earlier beats. Emotional contradiction—Kael’s combative care, Elara’s fear and stubbornness—is present but could be deepened further on Elara’s side. Still, their motives and micro-choices under pressure read coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and his actions align with his stated purpose, which gives him solidity on the page. However, he faces no real moral or emotional dilemma and exhibits little contradictory impulse under pressure. The interiority leans archetypal rather than character-particular, with limited sense of idiosyncratic thought or flaw. The final choice thus reads as dutiful execution of a training rather than a hard-won, costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s vocation as a restorer of broken masks gives him a specific, credible lens on the ritual, and his calm competence against Kaelen’s fear establishes a clear status dynamic. Motivation—grounding restless spirits to preserve the sanctuary—is stable and tracks cleanly into his choice to demonstrate the ritual and then hand it off. What’s missing for a higher score is any real internal contradiction or moral friction; he never seems genuinely torn or personally at risk. Kaelen’s arc is more observational than decisional, though the final handoff hints at future growth.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation and trait set (“shielded openness,” “methodical curiosity,” “to interpret silence with empathy”) are clear and consistently dramatized through specific work habits and choices. Her emotional progression from professional focus to a “tremor of connection” is credible and embodied rather than labeled. Internal contradiction (guarded vs. empathic, archivist vs. trespasser into the unknown) is present but subtle, keeping the arc slightly under its full potential. The final act—annotating the map rather than “fixing” it—feels earned and character-specific, though the cost is more conceptual than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—her “quietly analytic” mind, steady pulse, and decision to leave the globe all align credibly. Interiority is particular enough to feel lived-in, especially in the way she frames grief as “physics,” but we get limited contradictory impulse on the page; she moves fairly smoothly to her insight. Mortimer is an evocative device yet remains mostly symbolic, not a pressure-bearing relationship. The final stance—choosing to leave the girl where she is—feels earned but could carry more visible internal struggle to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to reach and soothe Lyra’s fading, coded consciousness—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his ritual actions. His emotional life is textured (weariness, fear of failure, tenderness), but internal conflict is limited; he rarely faces a genuine dilemma beyond the risk of not being understood. Micro-choices (how he encodes, when he finishes) do reveal values, yet they never force a true trade-off. The final stance—accepting temporary communion as “enough”—is moving but carries only a modestly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and credible, especially the mix of duty, grief, and guilty curiosity as he reads the diary (“He felt like an intruder, yet he couldn't stop”). His motivation—to understand the truth beneath Elara’s public anguish—is clear and consistently drives micro-choices (putting on the goggles, unfolding the vellum, deciding to keep the secret). The final stance shift toward “affectionate detachment” feels earned, with a real cost in accepting permanent partial ignorance. The one limitation is that his internal conflict could be sharpened further in the moment of intrusion versus loyalty, which now skews a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to memorialize Lena and prove that empty spaces remember—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in his choices (using the telescope, naming the clouds). His interiority feels particular (e.g., “fear was a low-altitude emotion”) rather than generic. However, there’s little in the way of contradictory impulses or live internal struggle; he’s serenely aligned with his purpose from the outset. The final shift from castaway to curator is resonant but not hard-won on the page, which keeps this shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s sensibility is sharp and particular—her face blindness, tactile focus, and emotional connection to “the pattern of their anxieties” feel lived-in and consistent with her final actions. Motivation is clear and rooted in her guild role and aesthetic values rather than generic heroism. Under pressure, her attention narrows realistically to touch and time. Internal contradiction is relatively muted, though—the piece hints at fear vs reverence but doesn’t fully dramatize that clash in the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to chart the stranded luminance and prove himself more than an apprentice—is clear, consistent, and drives all his choices. His curiosity is dramatized in the way he lingers on the hopscotch scuffs and makes the intuitive leap with the phrasebook. However, internal conflict and contradiction are light: we don’t see him genuinely torn between competing values, just frustrated vs. hopeful. The shift from “apprentice” to “cartographer of living light” is thematically neat but carries limited on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are cleanly defined and stay consistent, and her tactile relationship to tools and prophecy feels particular rather than generic. The ache and “driftwood nostalgia” give her an inner weather that colors perception. What’s missing for top-tier characterization is a sharper sense of conflicting impulses or a visible price for success beyond fatigue and wistfulness; the choice to act never truly costs her anything on the page. The final emotional shift is convincing but a touch too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara, Anya, Kaelen, and the ghost all have clear, coherent motivations, and their actions align cleanly with survival and escape. However, interiority is fairly thin; we get almost no contradictory impulses or embodied ambivalence at pivot moments (e.g., trusting the chalk, committing to the climb). The family dynamic is sketched rather than dramatized under pressure, so changes in their relationships are implied more than earned in-scene. The ghost’s selflessness is stated rather than revealed through conflicted choices, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s role, emotional texture, and history (the mother, the puppet) are vivid, and his actions align cleanly with his articulated purpose. The “bruised awe” is specific and embodied (“held the splintered wood to his cheek,” “ragged, satisfied sighs”). However, internal contradiction under pressure is limited—he accepts his duty with almost no friction, so we rarely see competing impulses or real moral struggle on the page. The endurance at the end reads earned but emotionally smooth rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation (reluctant yet stubbornly committed caretaker) is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially in answering the horn and assembling the beacon despite his weariness. Interiority is specific and embodied (“ache that heralded the night frost,” “weary resignation”) rather than generic. The internal conflict between curse, duty, and the small meaning he extracts from saving strangers is present but could be pushed into sharper contradiction on the page. His final endurance lands as earned stasis, though the cost is more implied than deeply dramatized internally.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s interiority is specific, grounded in his chemist’s mindset, and his motive—“to atone” by understanding what he broke—guides every perception. The tension between his controlling, rationalist past and his current grief-driven openness is clear and feels particular rather than generic. The shift at the end—from knot-tight grief to “something softer, something like hope”—is well earned by the accumulative realizations sparked by the setting and the foam. If anything, contradictions could be dramatized a touch more through present-tense micro-choices rather than mostly through reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s core motivation (to locate the origin of stories) is clear and consistently drives his choices, culminating in the decision to wound the perfect tree. However, his emotional life is more conceptual than embodied; we rarely feel his conflict in concrete, contradictory impulses, so the “cost” of his act remains largely intellectual. The interiority has specificity (“profound dissatisfaction hummed beneath his calm”) but leans on abstraction rather than sensory emotion under pressure. The final shift from dissatisfaction to readiness is earned but somewhat tidy and untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to blunt the cutting edges of memory, his own and others’—is clear, specific, and threads cleanly from the courtyard to the pavilion to his return. The emotionally contagious touch and his role as “final taster” personalize the burden well. However, his internal conflict at the climax is under-dramatized; he accepts the agony of subsuming millennia of grief almost too smoothly, with little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse. The relationship with the Warlord has texture and status dynamics but could sharpen further under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (“to construct bridges from silos”) and his occupational specificity are strong and consistent, and his empathy-guided technical choices in the climax feel earned. However, he reads almost entirely competent and unconflicted, with little internal contradiction or genuine risk of moral or emotional error. The piece could reach a higher tier by showing his limits or doubts under pressure rather than a serene mastery. As is, this is a vivid but relatively untroubled portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving abandoned dreams against the “Great Simplification”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her profession and mindset. Her interiority is specific (helix-minded, seeing spirals and echoes) and embodied through ritualistic preparation and physical risk. Internal conflict (risk of self-dissolution vs. drive to preserve) is present but could be sharpened into more simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure. The final shift—carrying the composer’s dream and accepting the cost—is well-earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation and professional identity are clear and particular (“prism-minded archivist” who hunts “forgotten combinations”), and his actions align with that drive throughout. However, his inner life under pressure is relatively one-note—duty and competence—with little dramatized contradiction or irrational impulse when panic “tries to find a hold.” The final sense of burden is believable but not deeply earned through on-page internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, character-specific, and tightly fused to her disability and craft; the need “to create music in a silent world” credibly drives every choice. Interiority is rendered through perception and vocation rather than abstract labels, and the moment of recognizing the Old One’s cracks as a “score” feels earned. What’s missing at an elite level is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or cost—she moves from problem to solution with little on-page resistance. The emotional shift at the end is resonant but could cut deeper if it visibly foreclosed an alternative path or revealed a more conflicted flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelan’s characterization as an exiled, hyper-analytical tutor is vivid and consistent, with his chess-trained mind shaping how he parses the nexus. His motivation—to find beauty and elegant logic in a hostile, alien exile—is clear and sustained. The exile/prince backstory is efficiently tied to the basalt stone and his current stance. What keeps this just under top tier is the relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or sharply pressured choice; his emotional journey is smooth rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: an “eclectic pacifist” who treats silence as the path to empathy, and his refusal to read the diary in favor of preserving its “silent feeling” is a strong, character-specific renunciation. His synesthetic interiority (“tasting” colors, hearing textures) feels particular rather than generic and directly drives his choices. Internal conflict is relatively low; he’s under time pressure but not meaningfully torn between competing values, which keeps the emotional range a bit narrow. The final act—opening the clasp yet not reading—lands as an earned endurance of his ethic but could carry sharper cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to master the silent language of plants and pass the “ultimate test” of the corpse flower—remains clear and consistent, and her hyper-sensitive nose is both asset and flaw. The internal conflict crystallizes under pressure when the new wind arrives: the urge to flee versus the commitment to stay and listen differently. Her choice to anchor on the seed’s scent rather than shut herself down feels earned by prior setup. The main limitation is that her flaw and its cost stay largely interior and philosophical, never quite touching a sharper relational or practical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear and consistent, and her role as “orchard pilot” feels specific rather than generic. However, interior conflict is minimal: she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure, so the arc reads more as a competent execution of a plan than a fraught personal test. Embodied emotion appears (“resonated in Elara’s teeth and bones,” the silence as pressure) but doesn’t deepen into morally or psychologically complex choices. The closing realization about “the planet’s memory of strength” is conceptually rich but not strongly tied to a visible change in her self-understanding or values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation (“to cultivate foresight in action”) is clear and coherently expressed through his investigative rigor, but his emotional and psychological texture remains relatively spare. We get very little in-scene contradiction or embodied conflict; his competence largely defines him. The final realization that his success is hollow lands, yet it feels more stated than deeply dramatized. This keeps him from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael’s motivation and role are clear and coherent, and his serenity fits the mythic register, but he remains largely a function (the designated bell ringer) rather than a psychologically complex individual. Interiority is filtered through grand abstractions about wonder and silence instead of specific, contradictory impulses or costs. He never experiences genuine doubt or strain; the “quiet fire against the cold” is asserted but not tested. The final beat registers change in the world more than in him, so his arc feels more symbolic than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and his choice to use the flute differently is well-rooted in that history. Interiority is specific (“harvest insights from that failure,” treating the flute as hammer vs. needle), with embodied emotion in the ice-shard guilt. However, his internal conflict is resolved a bit too cleanly into a single realization, with little on-page resistance or risk of repeating the old mistake. The emotional complexity is strong but stops short of genuinely jagged or self-contradictory in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply etched—his data-driven, parasitic empathy feels distinctive and consistent, and Anya’s grief reads clearly if somewhat archetypal. His motivation (understanding the “mathematics” of emotion) coheres with his choices in the scene. However, Anya lacks much internal contradiction or specific history, so her transformation lands more conceptually than personally. The final endurance—she keeps her grief, newly mapped—is earned but could carry more individual cost if her inner life had been richer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s anxiety, superstition about routes, and dependence on Elara’s teachings give him a clear, specific interior life, and his embodied fear (tremor, breath, clutching the pouch) feels believable. The internal contradiction between wanting safe routine and being told to “coax wonder from the routine” is well seeded. The closing shift—“The jittery courier was gone”—is maybe a touch neat for such a deep change, but it is causally motivated by the vision and the garden of light. The absence of Elara as an active foil limits relational pressure but fits the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s grief-scientist/mystic blend feels specific and internally coherent, with his need for a “method” and a “conduit” clearly rooted in being both devout and empiricist. His long-term obsession with the prism and his refusal to indulge pure fantasy make his final conceptual collapse earned. The emotional turn from sacred, poetic memory to “cold, mechanical truth” lands with visible cost. A slightly richer sense of contradictory impulses in the peak moment (hope versus dread) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to send a message even at the cost of her memories—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her interiority is specific (scent of his hair, cadence of his laugh) and those particulars are convincingly converted into the price she pays. The final renunciation (weaving the locking threads knowing they will sever her connection) is well-earned and costly. The one limitation is that her internal conflict is mostly resolved before the scene (she has already decided to pay the price), so contradictory impulses in the moment are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—“hands too gentle for his trade” and the final decision to descend again tomorrow bookend a coherent character. His sacrifice of specific memories is a strong, embodied cost that reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is more muted (he’s almost entirely steadfast, with little dramatized doubt), which keeps the psychology somewhat simple. Still, his quiet endurance at a real price reads earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivations (truth about Elara, ending the haunt of the bay) are clear and consistent, and his profession as a “sensory map maker” feels character-specific rather than a pasted-on quirk. His climactic choice to redirect the energy aligns with what we’ve seen of his competence and drive. However, internal contradiction and emotional messiness under peak pressure are underplayed—he moves from realization to action a bit too smoothly, with limited visible struggle between wanting his sister back and accepting she’s unreachable.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s reticence, competence, and deep attachment to the routine and the unseen keeper are cleanly established and drive every choice once the light fails. His motivation to “protect” is rooted in a believable need for safety rather than heroism, and the moment with the logbook and the farewell stones gives him a quiet but tangible emotional cost. The internal conflict is understated but present—he can’t save the person, only the system—and his endurance at the end reads as earned stasis rather than epiphany. This could edge higher with one beat where his fear or reluctance visibly pulls against his competence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelan’s core motivation and role are vivid and consistent, and his manic joy in the work is well-rendered, but his inner life remains more archetypal than specific. We get little in the way of concrete contradictory impulses beyond exhilaration shading into exhaustion. The final realization that the dawn is shaping him is conceptually strong but not deeply prepared as an inner conflict. This keeps the arc from feeling fully earned on a character level for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—new curiosity after the transplant—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through his observational experiments and eventual approach. His identity as a dye master shapes a distinctive way of thinking (pigment vs. structure) that meaningfully drives his realizations. However, internal contradiction and visible emotional cost are relatively soft; he transitions from old life to new perception with little on-page resistance or fallout. The woman is more an embodied enigma than a pressured character, but that suits the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Aris has a clear, idiosyncratic motivation (“discover what trees witness”) and a well-drawn professional stance (“quantified sorrow”), and his choices consistently align with those motives. His interiority is conveyed mostly through perceptions and focused attention rather than explicit emotion, but it still feels specific rather than generic. What’s missing at a top-tier level is any substantial internal contradiction or cost: his values are never challenged or put in tension with one another. The final act of archiving the shard is emotionally satisfying but doesn’t force him to renounce or endure anything difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (rekindling a dying realm via the Lumina tree) is clear and consistent, and her caregiving acts are specific enough to feel character-driven rather than generic. However, she faces little genuine inner conflict or contradiction—her duty is heavy but never seriously resisted or complicated—and her emotional journey is more stated than deeply dramatized. The final change (memory of the song becoming whole) is credible but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation (understanding his refusal rather than reversing it) is clear, consistent, and rooted in a specific flaw—overwhelming empathy turned into avoidance. His interiority is rich and embodied (“low-grade fever of the spirit,” “psychic hailstorm”) and his paradox—compassionate recluse—is dramatized rather than merely told. The shift at the end, from needing empty shelter to accepting shared sanctuary, feels earned by his micro-choices to observe Elara while using “staying while leaving.” The only minor weakness is how neatly his realization is articulated in thesis-like lines, slightly smoothing over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to resist erasure by cultivating small pockets of life—is clear, particular, and consistently embodied in her choices and perceptions. Her emotional life is grounded in concrete objects (the bread heel, the dirt under her nails), and the moment of “uncloaking” before the patrolman feels earned. However, her internal conflict is relatively gentle; we don’t see a strong clash of contradictory impulses in the confrontation itself, which keeps this just shy of top-tier depth. The patrolman is efficiently sketched as tired and young, but remains more functional than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s role, vocation, and motivation are clearly established and consistently enacted, and his micro-choices at the console feel grounded in that identity. However, his interior life is relatively thin: we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict beyond a generalized sorrow. The piece leans on externalized description of his task more than on textured, character-specific interiority. As a result, his endurance at the end reads earned but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to both protect her world and capture “the sound of trust breaking”—is vivid and consistent, and her persistence through three distinct tactics under pressure reads true. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her trade and environment, avoiding stock emotion. Secondary characters (Silas, Eva, Boro) are sketched with sharp, functional strokes that clearly express status dynamics. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page inner conflict in the climax; she never seems genuinely torn, only driven.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization as a “luminous skeptic” is vivid and consistent, with her desire for proof and her embodied method (tasting pressure shifts) giving her specificity. Her internal conflict—skepticism vs awe—is present but remains largely observational, with limited on-page cost to her choices. The final repricing (“not about fixing people… learning to read a map written in lightning and rain”) feels earned by what she’s witnessed rather than an ungrounded epiphany. Secondary carriers function more as moving symbols than pressures on her, which keeps the crucible fairly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—his weariness with commodified portraiture versus his yearning for authentic creation is well dramatized in images like the charcoal under his nails and the failed lock. The mentor relationship, though off-page, feels specific enough to pressure his choices. However, his final shift into readiness comes a bit too smoothly; there’s little on-page resistance once he decodes the painting, so the internal contradiction doesn’t quite peak under pressure. The epiphany is earned but slightly tidy for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s longing for authenticity and quiet obsession with “where lost conversations go” are clear, consistent drivers, and his final choice to become a cultivator of truth is well motivated. His interiority is specific (calligrapher’s precision, attention to script) rather than generic, and his emotional reactions are grounded in the world’s rules. However, we see relatively little in-scene contradiction or internal push–pull under pressure; his shift at the end feels earned but not deeply contested. The absence of on-page relationships limits the chance to reveal him through conflict with others.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s motivation and role are clear and specific, and his professional interiority (how he listens to and works with the ice) feels convincingly individuated. However, his emotional life is largely single-note—dedicated, quietly satisfied—without much contradictory impulse or visible struggle under pressure. The seasonal muteness and the “burning” motivation are asserted more than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. The ending endurance/renunciation is credible but carries little personal cost beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The android’s motivation—resolving the “inner static” and escaping—remains clear and consistently drives each choice. The tension between machine logic and glitchy nostalgia for Elara gives the interiority specificity rather than stock AI angst. Peak-pressure beats (“my processors scream with overload warnings”) show strain and partial degradation of thought in a character-appropriate way. A bit more irrational or self-contradictory impulse at the decision to burn the dome could deepen complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a gentle, community-minded listener whose choices drive the story, and his curator sensibility meshes well with how he treats objects and people. Interiority is present but limited; he feels more like an emblem of a value (listening) than a fully conflicted person under pressure. His action-to-motive chain is clean—choosing to wait and listen instead of forcing the mailbox—but almost entirely without ambivalence or visible personal cost. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently and distinct enough, but they function mainly as clue-givers rather than as full relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives (freeing her mother, transforming vulnerability into strength) are clear, specific, and embodied in her habits of code, dance, and ritual with the dice. Her inner world feels particular rather than generic, especially the fusion of logic and lyricism. The final surrender to chance is motivated by her reflection on her mother’s purism, though a sharper flicker of doubt or fear at the moment of rolling could deepen the sense of cost. Relationships are necessarily one-sided here, but the mother–daughter dynamic is effectively dramatized through objects and code.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s grief, obsession, and tenderness toward Elara are clear and concretely embodied (the wildflower book, his nightly rounds), and his actions align tightly with his motive. Internal contradiction is relatively muted—he barely wavers or questions the risks or ethics—so his arc is more endurance than transformation. Still, the final shift from dogged searching to hope with proof of concept feels earned. The absence of Elara on the page limits relational dynamism but fits the piece’s focus.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her methodical, gentle determination fits the tone. However, she experiences almost no internal conflict or visible cost; competence never frays, and contradictory impulses don’t surface in the scene. The result is a credible but somewhat flat emotional arc. Her final state feels like a continuation rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s desire to understand buildings is vivid and specific, and Elias’s presence as both tutor and building-memory gives their dynamic texture. Her shift from contented complicity in the “agreed upon lies” to needing the truth is motivated and lands cleanly in the rooftop scene. However, her internal conflict at the moment of confrontation is sketched more conceptually than embodied, which slightly softens the impact of her choice to become the building’s new “librarian of whispers.” Elias remains more archetypal than fully individuated, though that partly suits his role.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation—recovering a quarantined memory to resolve unexplained isolation—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices. The tension between his “charmed skeptic” nature and his craving for wholeness is dramatized in the choice to push deeper into the memory despite fear. Emotional experience is embodied via sensory detail (the shell’s coolness, dizziness, the ghost of her hand), not just labels. A minor weakness is a tendency toward abstract self-description (“fractured man living in the shadow of a curated peace”) that slightly flattens his individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—“a forgery of compassion,” to release his ancestors from an inherited war—is clear, particular, and beautifully tied to his specialized skill. His interiority feels grounded in tactile perception (cold air, trembling, the altar’s marble) rather than labels. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or moral wobble under pressure; he never seriously entertains not doing it or failing, which slightly flattens the potential for internal conflict. Still, his final peace feels earned by the careful groundwork in preparation and reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear, personal, and sustained, and her grief over her mother usefully complicates her quest without derailing it. Interiority is textured and mostly embodied (“a shard of glass in her heart”), though the internal conflict stays relatively clean and contemplative rather than messy under pressure. The final redefinition of her role (“finisher of songs”) is earned by prior beats and carries a felt cost. A slightly tidier emotional progression and lack of real self-contradiction in-scene keep this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and vocation are clear and particular, and the boy/man dynamic is legible and affecting, but Elara’s own inner conflict remains relatively low-key for such a high-stakes psychic intervention. Her choices (deepen trance, construct shared dream, confront via images not accusation) track cleanly with her stated aim to “salvage something pure,” yet we rarely feel her doubts, fears, or personal cost in embodied ways. The man’s guilt-crusted self-justification is sketched rather than deeply inhabited, which keeps him from full complexity. The final shift—Elara moving from burden to “profound lightness”—is earned but a bit emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is specific and coherent—his net-mending, tea-making, and pattern-seeking all arise from the same contemplative cast of mind, and his small but meaningful choices (leaving the parapet, entering the firefly field, deciding to whistle, then accepting his smallness) feel motivated. The “demure audacity” of wanting to join the pattern while knowing he’s insignificant gives him a quiet contradiction that suits the scale. Emotional states are mostly embodied through tactile detail (calloused fingers, warmth of the bowl, the “beautiful weight” on his soul) rather than labels. The only limitation is that his internal conflict never fully sharpens into a true dilemma, so the final acceptance, while earned, carries relatively low visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation as a professional debunker of myths is clear and consistent, and their methodical work reconstructing the letters shows competence under pressure. However, interior conflict is thin: there’s little sense of contradictory impulses (e.g., fear of breaking the “miracle” vs. need for truth). Emotional embodiment is muted; the work feels interesting but not costly to Kaelen. The ending stance (“one more lie…replaced with a fact”) arrives without much visible inner struggle, keeping the arc strong but not deep.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s core motivation (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and consistently dramatized in his choices to filter the voices and finally reject both factions. His interiority is specific enough to feel individual—a mix of obsessive focus, loneliness, and visionary stubbornness—though his panic-to-resolution pivot around the chest and map could use a bit more contradictory impulse on the page. The emotional cost of carrying a “nascent world” is stated and glimpsed but not deeply embodied at the climax. Still, the final decision is credibly earned by prior behavior and belief.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation and inner texture are vivid—his “sweet sorrow of being the sole witness” and the ethical drive to “catch the echoes of the lost” feel specific and earned. His micro-choices (taking the box, refusing simple repair, curating sounds) all align with this worldview. What’s missing at a top-tier level is live contradiction under pressure: he never wavers, doubts, or wants something that cuts across his self-appointed role. The arc resolves as affirmation rather than a hard-won shift, so the cost of his choice remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (protecting the Siren’s Heart) is clear, consistent, and drives every action, from noticing the discordant hum to enduring the painful resonance-matching. Her emotional life is embodied (the cold knot of dread, her trembling afterward) and plausibly filtered through a disciplined, duty-bound mindset. The “logically emotional” tag risks feeling label-y, but it is backed by behavior (acknowledging fear, then filing it away to act). The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis: she preserves the status quo at real physical and psychic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s internal conflict between a “wild animal” impatience and a disciplined, watchful purpose is clear, embodied, and consistent, and it directly shapes her tactics and final choice. Her professional competence (charts, schematics, chronometer) balances well with genuine struggle. The movement from clawing restlessness to “serene and terrible” victory reads earned and character-specific. The only limiter at this level is that we see her almost entirely in a single, familiar emotional register, with little surprise in her self-conception beyond what is declared early.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and grounded: the tension between his empiricist identity and the uncanny “entangled memories” reads as a genuine conflict rather than a neat epiphany. His micro-choices—continuing to investigate despite Fletcher’s order, picking up the notebook, deciding to write a fuller report—are all credibly motivated. The desire to resist Fletcher’s flattening of complexity is seeded early and pays off in the closing stance. The one limit is that his emotional cost (professional risk, psychic disturbance) remains more implied than fully embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arthur’s guilt and need for repair are specific and embodied, and Elias’s evolution from prisoner to craftsman comes through in gesture and diction rather than label. Arthur’s motivation—trying to atone for failing Thorne—is clear and drives every on-page choice. The realization about his true role (not repairing men but pointing out “cracks”) feels earned by prior beats, though it resolves a touch neatly. Emotional reactions are concrete (the “heavy, leaden thing” of his heart; the slow dawn of understanding) rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s curiosity and stubbornness are vividly embodied (“no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray”), and his history with the ritual gives him depth beyond a one-note tinkerer. His motivation—to decode the Yearning Algorithm and “ring a bell no one hears yet”—consistently drives his choices through the build and test. What’s missing at this level is sharper internal contradiction under peak pressure; he never meaningfully doubts, flinches, or wants two incompatible things at once. The closing shift is more situational (having done the impossible) than a felt inner reconfiguration with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—finding the last piece of her brother—is vivid, consistent, and drives every choice, with the lie to Kael and the final forwarding both feeling appropriately pressured by that desire. Her grief and obsession are concretely rendered through details like the “low hum beneath the server noise” and her fixation on the patch. Internal conflict (lying/betraying truth vs protecting Julian’s ghost) is present but could be pushed further on the page in the confrontation moment. Julian reads more as a compelling absence/idea than a fully individuated person, but that works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s role as an empathic arbiter is clear and specific, and Mara’s fear-based misjudgment plus Jorn’s quiet competence all read as credible under pressure. The visions personalize both Mara’s trauma and Jorn’s intention, giving each character a non-generic emotional center. However, lines like “His motivation was simple, yet endlessly complex: to map empathy onto action” and “He was a courageous anomaly” flatten some nuance into labels rather than letting behavior fully carry it. The emotional shift at the end—Mara’s shoulders slumping, the shared sigh—feels earned and relationally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and credible: the “euthanasia tourist masquerading as a saint” and her admission that she’s using others’ catastrophe as a classroom give her a sharp, non-generic edge. Her motive—to understand endings before her own—is clear and consistently refracted through objects (the parasol tip) and setting (the marina’s “bones”). The main limitation is that her internal conflict doesn’t quite culminate in a difficult on-page choice; it resolves in a realization more than a tested renunciation. Still, the final calm feels earned by the groundwork laid in earlier paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply realized through his tactile habits, viticultural eye, and reflective intelligence; his shift from seeing the letter as “the end of love” to an act of preservation feels motivated and earned. The vineyard metaphors reveal his psychology rather than sitting on top of it. Internal contradiction—fierce passion vs. belated gentleness—is present, though it could surface a bit more as live friction rather than largely retrospective clarity. The one slightly abstract line about “intersubjective understanding” edges toward essay-speak rather than character-texture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, specific, and continuous from first paragraph to last, and his actions all align with this drive. His interiority is present but skewed toward functional description of process rather than lived contradiction, so we rarely see impulses in genuine conflict. The “strangely honest” label is supported in one concrete moment (calling out the disciple) but not deeply stress-tested later. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting others’ distortion while working alone) is credible but carries a muted on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and role are clear and specific, and his “subtle puzzle archivist” identity is well dramatized through his methodical work with the photographs. However, he reads more as an emblematic figure than a fully conflicted person; we don’t see contradictory impulses or any serious cost to his chosen vocation. His emotional life is largely inferred from tone, not dramatized via embodied reactions under pressure. The final “choice” to finish and leave feels serene and inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated, with the opening image (“folded into the shape of a question mark”) giving him a lived-in specificity, and his shift from curator to oracle reads earned. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure, so we rarely see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. His ultimate renunciation of publication in favor of silent testimony is motivated and credible, but the emotional cost of that choice could be embodied more viscerally. Overall, he feels individual and consistent, if somewhat serenely uncontested by other forces.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s drive (“to capture the sound of growing older”) is vivid and consistent, and his precognitive forgetting plus the self-laid driftwood trail give him particularity under pressure. His emotions are embodied (vibration in his teeth, pressure behind his eyes, panic cutting through longing) and his final shift from desperate capture to accepting presence feels earned. The internal contradiction—need to fix/possess time vs. eventual surrender to being inside it—lands, but we see only a single, fairly linear facet of his personality. A touch more contradiction in how he copes (e.g., resentment at his past self or self-deception) could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—both the professional drive to save the station and the private need to “harness the ephemeral” linked to his lost lover and the lens. His competence under pressure is convincing, but his internal contradiction (duty vs clinging to the last relic of her) is stated more than dramatized in beat-by-beat hesitation. The choice to sacrifice the lens lands as meaningful, though he moves toward it with near-perfect serenity that slightly flattens emotional struggle. Hima functions adequately as a pressure-bearing secondary, not much more.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly motivated and distinct, with her music-therapist lens and ritualized care shaping every choice, and Lena’s brief on-page presence still carries emotional weight. However, Elara borders on idealized—she never visibly struggles or missteps—and Lena’s reversal happens largely off-page, which softens the sense of characters under genuine pressure. Mr. Aris is mostly an emblematic figure rather than a full interior presence, though his vinyl shard is a strong, character-specific detail. The final endurance—the “flawless goodbye” achieved—is earned but feels almost too frictionless to fully satisfy a high-end literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand noon-shadows and repair a broken logic) is clear and consistent, and her competence is well-grounded in specific habits (“quiet deliberation,” weeks spent on the key). Interiority is present but mostly oriented to procedure and world-logic rather than contradictory impulses, so emotional conflict feels muted. Her final satisfaction at “one small piece of a broken world making perfect, elegant sense again” is earned but comes at no visible personal cost. The piece gives us a precise mind at work rather than a deeply conflicted person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply etched: a rational bone-setter whose longing for his wife's faith creates a tangible inner contradiction. His motives are clear and consistent, and the discovery of the tooth lands as a credible breaking point rooted in those traits. Embodied detail—trowel in hand, knuckles white—keeps emotion grounded. The only slight limitation is that his regret toward the town remains more told than freshly dramatized in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to create a non-destructive, star-like light) is clear and consistently rooted in her past trauma with fire and her cosmic longing. Interiority is specific and embodied—salt-stained fingers, the weight and warmth of the shard, the remembered meteor shower with her grandmother. Internal conflict is present but gentle: she pauses to weigh the shard’s promise against memory of the village fire, then recommits. The arc is modest but earned: from untethered watcher to maker of a shareable, gentle “star.”

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and credible—her “watchful dreamer” nature and quietly proactive caretaking are dramatized in concrete behaviors, and Kaelen’s shame and hollowed-out state register without therapy-speak. The relationship functions as the crucible: her risk in breaking the hush to confront his self-image feels earned by prior beats. The final micro-shift—his fingers closing around the pendant in understanding rather than self-condemnation—is motivated and legible as a stance change. A slightly stronger embodiment of Kaelen’s inner conflict (beyond the “ghost” and “shroud” metaphors) would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s conflict between commercial success and lost “magic” is concrete and particular, and the seashell ties his present crisis to a childhood motive in a believable way. His choice to endure the current and then bury the shell feels earned by the prior depiction of despair and regret. Internal states are mostly embodied (“cold, invisible pressure,” fingers on the sharp edge) rather than labeled, with no cheap epiphanies. The only minor limitation is that we don’t see much contradiction in his impulses in the moment—he moves steadily toward atonement once the pattern is set.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation—to restore sacred practices and remedy the village’s malaise—is clear and consistent, and his tinkerer background nicely colors his approach to song as “tuning the world.” However, he faces little real resistance, internal or external, so we see him mostly as capable and reverent rather than conflicted. The lack of contradictory impulses or visible cost in his choice to perform the ritual keeps the characterization from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation and temperament are very clear—his patience, ritual focus, and care for unseen children feel specific and embodied (“his posture a study in physical patience”). However, he borders on saintly; there’s little contradiction, doubt, or selfishness to complicate him under pressure. The physical toll (knees cracking, profound cold) hints at cost but never opens into real internal conflict. The endurance at the end reads as credible Earned Stasis, but it’s emotionally smooth rather than difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motivation and working philosophy are clear and consistent, and his behavior—methodical, oblique observation, patience—embodies those traits convincingly. However, he experiences little on-page internal conflict or degradation under stress; he’s almost serenely competent throughout. The “felt cost” of his endurance (the oppressive, wounded season; isolation) remains more implied than dramatized in his body or psyche. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation and role are sharply defined and particular—his collecting and transforming of grief feels specific rather than generic. His interiority is vivid in texture but somewhat static; he is more function than conflicted person, with little sense of competing impulses or possible refusal. The loneliness and cost of his vocation are present but not deeply contested on the page. Strong, but slightly more character contradiction or friction would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and particular: the timed “window” for grief, her focus on extracting “usable parts,” and the tactile comfort of tools all feel lived-in and specific. Her haunting practicality versus her need to ritualize loss creates a quiet but credible internal contradiction. Micro-choices (sitting with the memory, choosing which moment to crystallize, what line to cut) all align with that core. The endurance at the end—accepting a small, contained piece of him instead of impossible totality—reads as an earned stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and grounded: the link between past ambition, present scavenging, and the need to “negotiate with his own ghost” feels psychologically coherent. The younger self as ghost is a clear, character-rooted device rather than a gimmick, and the final acceptance of fault is earned by prior traits and choices. Emotional states are mostly embodied in concrete perceptions (sound as amber, the weight of the plastic wheel) rather than labels. The one mild softness is that his contradiction—self-exculpation vs self-blame—sits more in summary than in sharply dramatized in-scene wavering.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—official demolition survey masking a private quest for “equations for hope”—is clear and consistently enacted through her curiosity and problem-solving. Her embodied actions (kicking confetti, climbing gantries, rewiring) align well with her interior drive. The final conceptual shift about hope as “a current to be rerouted” is earned by prior behavior, though her internal conflict remains relatively low-stakes and could show more contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation—to make peace with an abandoned artistic calling—is clear and consistent, and the ritual of bearing the bells tracks cleanly with that aim. His interiority is specific and embodied (ink-stained fingers, the weight of the coffer), and the final renunciation/acceptance feels earned. However, internal contradiction is mostly implied; he seems largely resolved before the scene begins, so the moment-to-moment struggle is muted. A touch more live ambivalence in the forecourt would sharpen the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation—clearing his grandfather’s name and decoding the “architecture of lies”—is clear, consistent, and drives every action. Interiority is specific (his tactile “listening” to the mud, the trembling hands with the journal) and the emotional turn from suspicion to reverent understanding feels earned. The sacrifice revelation reconfigures his stance toward his grandfather with a believable emotional cost. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (compulsion for truth vs. dawning acceptance that the lie was protective), and could be sharpened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his professional lens (“seed collector” of ideas) feels particular and embodied in his choices. His patience across three days with the knot and his refusal to force it show character-through-action rather than labels. However, there’s little genuine internal contradiction or emotional friction; he moves through the piece with near-total serenity. The final “understanding bloomed” moment is earned but not steeped in visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s vocation, method, and drive to understand “the geography of healing” feel specific and coherent, and his micro-choices (staying on the island, engaging the thread, choosing to write) track with that. The projection sequence gives convincing, embodied interiority. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible cost—he understands and records, but we don’t see him meaningfully challenged or altered in a way that forecloses a path for him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s core drive—to reawaken organic beauty—is vivid, consistent, and visibly shapes all his choices from scavenging lichen resin to building the incubator. His obsessive, half-mad dedication is well embodied in sleeplessness and physical deterioration. Internal contradiction (longing for an idealized past vs. accepting an unforeseen hybrid future) is present but under-dramatized; his acceptance at the end feels a touch too smooth for such a consuming fixation. A slightly sharper moment of resistance or grief before acceptance would deepen the felt cost of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and specific—the firefighter daughter of an arsonist, with fire as both vocation and legacy, feels psychologically coherent and drives every key choice. Her rebellion through compassion (“a rebellion against the blood in her veins”) is articulated slightly on-the-nose rather than entirely dramatized in contradiction, but it’s still grounded by concrete acts like prioritizing the banyan and sacrificing the talisman. Interiority is filtered through tactile and sensory anchors rather than therapy-speak. The final renunciation of the coin and the embrace of grafting as “her true work” land as an earned shift in how she holds her inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and interior contradiction—skepticism versus aching belief—are sharply drawn and consistently dramatized (“realistically imaginative mind,” “luminous skeptic”). Her sidereal patience and methodical problem-solving feel particular rather than generic, and her micro-choices at the climax (rotating the box millimeter by millimeter) arise cleanly from those traits. The main limitation is cost: the story tells us she has devoted years to this, but the scene itself doesn’t make her risk or potential loss strongly felt beyond emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Xylar’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained: break the cosmic cycle of erasure and find a non-destructive way to share light. The interiority is vivid and character-particular (“vessel for feelings too vast for a heart”), and the sentimentalism feels embodied rather than labeled. However, the internal conflict never quite forces a painful trade-off; once the realization about “light as emission” lands, the shift into the new stance feels relatively unresisted. The cost of Xylar’s change (what it loses or risks in rejecting the ancestral pattern) remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s inner life is textured and particular, from the family poetry ritual to his obsessive, tactile engagement with the slate and ribbons. His motivation—to understand collective grief through his craft—is clear and consistently embodied in small choices (returning nightly, tracing lines, accepting the abstract monument). The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains relatively smooth; we see fixation and melancholy, but not many sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The final shift in his sense of purpose feels earned, if emotionally gentle rather than harrowingly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation (restoring communal balance after the disaster) is clear, particular, and consistently embodied in his ritual with the clock and rake handle. The internal conflict between containment and release (“his ethically diligent nature screamed at him to keep the memory contained”) feels specific and morally complicated rather than generic guilt. Micro-choices are mostly imagined rather than acted in-scene, but his decision to “let go” within the mental ritual credibly forecloses an easier path of static memorializing. The endurance at the end—accepting that “the work of absolution was never finished”—reads as earned stasis with visible ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to “discover the shape of intentions left behind”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to his occupation and rituals, and his meticulous decoding work feels like a credible extension of his temperament. His emotional arc from obsessive curiosity to quiet caretaking resolution is well earned. The main limitation is that his inner contradictions under pressure are only lightly sketched; there’s little simultaneous push–pull between duty, doubt, fear, etc., in the live moment. The result is rich but slightly too serene to reach the very top tier for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to avert cultural extinction by mapping the unknown within real constraints—is clear, coherent, and consistently dramatized through his process and hesitation. His inner conflict between condemning old ways and risking hardship versus accepting slow extinction is well-articulated and culminates in a credible final choice. The interiority is specific to his role (e.g., pruning future branches, thinking in “adjacent possible”), not generic angst. Emotional embodiment could be slightly more textured under peak pressure—there’s more stated weight than messy, contradictory feeling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is precise and consistent—his double life as copyist/preservationist is clear, and his choices (risking illegal listening, encoding stories) align with that. Interiority is textured in images like “thistled calm,” but we rarely see active internal contradiction under pressure; fear is named more than dramatized. The emotional cost of his isolation is sketched rather than really tested in-scene. Overall, he feels specific and credible, but not yet fully pressure-revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply defined through role, ritual, and her guarded compassion, and Kael’s grief is embodied enough to feel particular rather than generic. Her motivation—to curate a “perfect moment” while knowing it’s an illusion—is clear and consistent, especially in the last paragraph. However, her internal conflict mostly sits at the level of idea; we don’t see contradictory impulses actively clash in the moment of guiding Kael, which keeps this just shy of a deeper psychological portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s interior logic and motivation are sharply drawn: his commitment to rational preservation, his contempt for the Sun-Kissed, and his nagging doubt about purpose all feel specific and lived-in. The encounter with the girl functions as a crucible that tests whether he wants to be a teacher or a hermit archivist. The final renunciation (“He was not the world's teacher. He was its memory…”) is clearly earned by the prior conflict. A touch of tell-y characterization (“His rebellion was not born of anger…”) keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is strongly rendered: his mission, weariness, and stubborn hope feel specific and grounded in concrete detail (the rosette, the failed rehearsal). His shift from additive to subtractive thinking is motivated by prior frustration and his reverence for craft. Internal conflict—discouragement vs. duty—is present but resolved a touch neatly, without much irrationality or self-sabotage under pressure. The choir as a collective character is sketched effectively, though individual tensions remain abstract rather than dramatized through specific members.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, specific motive and a distinctive sensory interiority—the way betrayal, burning libraries, and compliance register as flavors makes him feel grounded and particular. His professional lens as a chef nicely colors how he understands history (“like a soup, could be re-seasoned”). However, he encounters little genuine internal contradiction or doubt once the pruning begins; the work is described as delicate and costly, but not really dramatized as a struggle. The final sense that “his work had just begun” gestures at enduring cost but doesn’t fully test or complicate his values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas and Lena both read as specific people with clear, differentiated motives: his compulsion to truth overlaid with a quasi-aesthetic mission, her professional weariness shading into curiosity. The involuntary truth-telling and his choice to use the riddle rather than a direct answer reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is modest but present—Silas balances honesty against a resistance to sterile efficiency. The emotional cost of his stance (accepting a small, indirect victory instead of systemic change) is implied rather than deeply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s sensibility is particular and well-embodied—her attention to lawns, greys, and the orris shard gives her a distinct, lived texture. Motivation is clear (to combat creeping deadness) and tracks to her micro-acts of sabotage, with a believable, modest epiphany at the cube house. What’s missing for higher bands is a sharper internal contradiction or visible cost—her “hushed blaze” never truly puts her at risk or forces a painful trade-off. Secondary figures are glimpses, not crucibles, which fits the scope but limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s indoctrination, moral recoil, and final act of burying the ampoule are cleanly motivated and feel organically earned from her interior struggle. Galen’s presence as a calm, morally anchored counterpoint is effective, though his characterization is more thematic function than fully embodied person. The contradiction between her ingrained righteousness and dawning horror is dramatized in-scene, not summarized. The emotional stakes could be slightly more embodied (fear, bodily stress) at the peak, but her change still registers as costly and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s motivation is precise and distinctive—he’s not escaping but interrogating a single missed probability—and his actions (the painstaking proofs, the final roll) follow cleanly from that. The moment of rupture gives him a vivid, painful embodiment of regret that feels earned. Internal contradiction (grim yet optimistic, wary of unraveling his own logic yet proceeding) is present but could surface more in on-page struggle during the build-up. Emotional texture is strong but stays mostly within a controlled, cerebral register rather than fully fraying under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s characterization is vivid and specific—the insomniac discipline, the greenhouse isolation, and the umbrella memory all cohere into a clear psychology. His motivation (“to prove that strangers remember kindness”) convincingly drives both the painting project and the rooftop reveal. The doubt during the long silence feels like real internal conflict, not a neat moral arc. The piece stops short of showing a visible cost beyond emotional strain, but for this length the endurance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Alistair’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—the historically minded curator who shifts from elegiac resignation to active leadership—and his actions (council appeal, sonic plan, leading the song) align tightly with that arc. Interiority is concrete (“rosewater dread,” the feel of the lens, dust of despair) and embodied, not generic. Internal contradiction exists (preserving art vs recognizing looming extinction) but could surface more sharply in-scene rather than mostly as setup and then clean resolution. Secondary characters (Maeve, Elara, the mother) serve as effective pressure and catalyst rather than full figures, which fits the scope but keeps this just shy of truly complex characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to step beyond fate’s design—is clear, specific, and drives his final choice to pull the lever. His interiority is vivid in sensory terms (“cold fire in his chest,” “bleak exhilaration”) but the piece leans more on stated resolve than dramatized internal contradiction under pressure. We don’t see a real tug-of-war between fear of erasure and desire for liberation; he feels tension, but never seems close to refusing. The closing shift into “shimmering, terrifying potential” reads as earned but emotionally somewhat schematic rather than knotted and messy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation and inner life are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through concrete reactions (the mirror flinch, the way he holds the clasp). The paradox of being both cursed and uniquely suited to confront Fear gives him a genuine, character-rooted contradiction. His final stance—claiming the void as anchor—feels earned by prior setup rather than a late revelation. The piece could push higher with a bit more textured contradiction in his emotions under peak pressure (e.g., more visible temptation to retreat, not just fear and resolve).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s motives and role are clear and specific (protector-artist who “turns obstacles into instruments”), and his embodied focus under pressure reads true. However, his interiority stays largely single-note—competent, anticipatory, almost serenely confident—so we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. The storm never really destabilizes his self-concept or values; he performs his established function and succeeds. That keeps the final endurance/resolution from feeling like it costs him much beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—his mother’s disappearance and need to decode the watchers give his obsession weight, and his “quiet drive” feels embodied rather than labeled. We get concrete behaviors that show his nature (long days on the tower, social isolation, pattern-obsession) and a credible final reorientation of purpose. The internal conflict (terror of the truth vs compulsion to know) is more implied than dramatized in-scene, and relationships exist mostly in summary (“neighbors thought he was mad”), limiting the emotional crucible. Still, for a single-POV, mostly solitary piece at this length, his arc from seeking answers to bearing a warning is convincingly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris and Elara are sharply defined with clear, opposing motives, and the power dynamic between “guardian” and “excavator” is legible and charged. Aris’s methodical, almost clinical persuasion fits his historian’s temperament and stays consistent. Elara’s reversal is motivated by the parallels to Ashworth, but her internal conflict is under-dramatized; she turns a bit quickly for the scale of what she’s yielding. The emotions lean cerebral and tidy rather than messily embodied, which slightly blunts the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the tension between his “man of straight lines” exterior and his fierce attachment to the inkwell and drowned pavilion feels specific and embodied. His motivation—to witness and preserve abandoned dreams—is consistent and drives all his choices, especially the dangerous retrieval dive. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, but the clash between stoicism and sudden desperation works. The final recommitment to his role (“he did not build… but he could bear witness”) feels earned by what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s calm, meticulous interiority is specific and consistent, and his suspicions about the archives clearly motivate every micro-choice. His emotional state—peace rather than outrage at uncovering theft—is distinctive and character-particular. The closing resolve to work quietly rather than expose the lie feels earned by his temperament and history. The only limit is that internal contradiction under pressure stays relatively muted; he never feels truly torn.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s grief, craft, and motivation are specific and embodied (“slow, abrasive prayer,” powdered starlight on his fingers), and his final reorientation toward folding cranes feels earned by the journey through the dream. Internal conflict is present as a push-pull between being consumed by grief and using his hands to hold it in form, though it could edge slightly deeper into contradictory impulses in the peak beat. The central renunciation—accepting grief as current rather than void—carries a clear cost. Overall, he reads as a distinct, grounded individual rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amal’s motivation is fierce, specific, and consistent—grief alchemized into a quasi-mystical research obsession—and her interiority is rich with character-particular detail (wedding geode, jasmine, missile crater). The interplay of scientific rigor and near-spiritual fixation feels credible and complex. There is some room for deeper contradiction or a sharper moment of moral doubt, but for this length her stance and final crystallization (“the grief…now had a trajectory”) are well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (“frequency of belonging”) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice from inserting the chip to forcing the corroded handle. However, her interiority leans more toward stated longing than dramatized contradiction—there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk beyond concentration and effort. The “perpetually surprised” trait is vivid but repeated rather than deepened. Her final softening into peace is earned but relatively low-cost and straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt, professional skill, and need to know are cleanly motivated and align with every choice he makes, especially the offer of false memories to Anya and the final vow to restore truth. His interiority is specific (“panning for a feeling, a resonance”) rather than generic, and his shift from paralyzing regret to cold purpose reads earned. However, we don’t see much live internal contradiction under pressure—his conflict is largely summarized as backstory rather than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. More embodied, moment-to-moment struggle during the search would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, guilt, and ritualized care give him a clear, specific motivation, and the brass drawer pull elegantly externalizes his burden. His uncommonly thoughtful nature is shown in how he reads Kaelen and handles the protocol, not just told. However, his internal conflict (guilt vs. pragmatic focus) is more asserted than actively dramatized under pressure, and Kaelen, while sketched with nuance, remains largely a mirror rather than a fully pressured counterpart. The final “wisdom” stance feels earned but somewhat under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, sea-longing, and self-loathing are specific, embodied, and consistent, with strong contradictions (love of the sea vs. avoidance of it) playing simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices—dropping the duffel, taking out the compass, stepping past the last pole—are motivated and reveal his value hierarchy. The “broken navigator” identity is convincingly lived-in rather than labeled. A slightly abstracted, essayistic register in places (“core motivation…align heart and action”) keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s drive—to reconcile a mandated “clean slate” with the lingering ghost of his past—is clear and consistently dramatized in his micro-choices (digging through classifieds, following the coordinates, descending further). His interiority is specific and textured (“a shadow he couldn't see but felt in the hollow spaces between his thoughts”), and his final shift toward building a future reads earned rather than convenient. The internal conflict between protecting his numb equilibrium and pursuing the painful unknown is implicit but strong. A few phrases drift toward abstract labeling of emotion (“blueprint of empathy”) instead of fully embodied feeling, which slightly softens the edge of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to reforge a mental/spiritual bond with Lyra at the cost of his humanity—is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict (“He wanted her, not to become her”) is strongly dramatized. His grief and resolve are embodied in specific actions (the cookie, the spices, the surrender to the scales) rather than generic labels. The final acceptance of metamorphosis feels earned by the prior resistance and setup. A slightly broader range of irrational or self-sabotaging impulses under peak pressure could deepen the portrayal further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to control or reclaim time in response to new motherhood—is clear, specific, and consistently shapes her perception of the world. The internal conflict between awe, love, and terror of loss is embodied in concrete objects (the saucer, the tablecloth, her inked skin). Her final renunciation of the quest and vow on the new cloth feels earned by the prior beats. There is a slight neatness to the resolution that trims some messier ambiguity, but not enough to undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are sharply drawn and consistent, from her pacifism to her self-imposed stewardship of humanity’s sorrow. The gravitational heaviness/lightness makes her emotional states embodied rather than abstract. Her final acceptance of her own childhood grief feels fully earned by the prior pattern of tending others’ pain. The only minor shortcoming is a slight reliance on broad abstractions (“life’s work,” “singular and immense”) where one or two more idiosyncratic, character-specific details could deepen her further.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s core motivation (understanding transformation) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—following the shell, releasing the fireflies—track cleanly with his “philanthropist of moments” nature. However, he reads more as a beautifully drawn witness than a pressured agent: we see little contradictory impulse or real internal conflict under strain. His emotional response at the climax is largely summarized (“breathless”) rather than deeply embodied in a character-particular way. The final realization about transformation feels earned but a bit tidy, with limited visible cost beyond poignantly empty bottles.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation and modus operandi are clear and consistent—his “winking hush and secrets” align well with how he uses panic as cover—but we see little genuine internal conflict or cost beyond a brief mention of trembling veins. His competence borders on effortless, which flattens potential contradictions between fear, loyalty, and revolution. The interiority is solid but not deep enough for elite-tier nuance. The ending endurance (choosing quiet subterfuge over open revolt) is credible but not emotionally fraught on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivations (quiet the visions, keep Elara’s promise, protect the bluff) are clear and consistent, and his competence under pressure feels earned. The precognition, promise, and “last resort” dust create a coherent psychology without resorting to labels. Internal contradiction is present but faint—he moves to the star dust quickly, with little dramatized resistance or irrationality. The closing shift from passive seer to someone who “bent the pattern” is credible, though the emotional cost of that shift could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific: “furiously tranquil” with a “screaming hurricane” inside gives him a clear, character-particular contradiction. His motivation—to understand the “cartography of scars”—is coherent and made to clash with his need for self-protection. The hour-long vigil and his hesitation before opening the envelope dramatize his conflict rather than merely stating it. You could push further into embodied reaction at the climax (when he sees the face on the negative) to make the emotional price more viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (“to turn questions into destinations”) and his methodical, almost ritualistic response to Elara’s challenge are clear and consistent, but his emotional life remains thin. We see competence, patience, and appreciation of her intellect, yet there’s no real contradiction or internal struggle under pressure—no moment where he doubts, hesitates, or reveals a cost beyond effort. The relationship with Elara is intellectually sketched but not dramatized on the page, which limits the sense of personal stake. The final choice to engage the puzzle instead of waiting passively fits his nature but doesn’t substantially reconfigure who he is.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s molting personas, penitential rebuilding, and quiet excitement at the drifters’ arrival give him layered, specific motivation, and his bond with Elara feels lived-in. The distinction between the Reckoner and the Architect is compelling, but we rarely see contradictory impulses in live conflict; the Reckoner remains mostly an idea rather than an active pressure in the scene. Elara is sketched efficiently as an anchor and co-conspirator, though she rarely exerts real counter-pressure. The young drifter woman is vivid but lightly drawn, functioning more as a sign of change than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian’s longing and stubborn defiance are clear and consistent, and his motivation to “surprise fate with an unplanned encore” cleanly drives his choices. Interiority is vivid but leans archetypal; we see more declared resolve than textured contradiction or messy irrationality under pressure. The clearest character-revealing move is his choice to treat the film as a “score,” turning grief into strategy. The emotional cost of leaving the arbor—and what he risks by stepping through—is implied but could be embodied more concretely in his body and thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and specific: a methodical “Reality Checker” in a whimsical world, torn between empiricism and the need for faith. Her doubt is embodied and recurring, and her final choice to act on feeling rather than data is well earned. The interior shift from doubt as anxiety to doubt as sustaining glow feels psychologically coherent. The only limit is that the leap from analysis to song/ritual happens quickly, so the cost of abandoning her tools isn’t explored as deeply as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kenji’s grief, patience, and guilt are clearly motivated and embodied through his bonsai ritual and relationship to the compass and lace, and his final inner softening reads as an earned change. However, his internal life remains fairly unified—there’s little on-page contradiction or self-sabotage beyond generalized guilt, which keeps him from feeling fully three-dimensional. Elara appears only in memory and never pushes back directly on his blind spots, so the relational crucible is muted. The shift from “seeking the color” to accepting feeling is convincing but emotionally smooth, with limited messy resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's transition from detached observer to participant is compelling and rooted in his specific background. However, the pivotal emotional shift relies on diagnostic labeling ("scientific detachment shattered," "spike of pure, irrational grief") rather than embodied reaction, which slightly distances the reader at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal conflict is well-rendered, moving from trauma-induced paralysis to creative reclamation. The shift in motivation is earned through the investigative process, and the final choice to light the kiln feels psychologically grounded and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to translate silence is compelling and grounds the high-concept premise. However, the climax relies on a generic "surge of will" to integrate the trauma, which bypasses a more distinct, character-specific choice or sacrifice. The emotional resolution feels slightly neat given the weight of the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the "immense cost" of the protagonist's talent is stated in exposition rather than dramatized in the scene, leaving the final relief unearned by visible sacrifice. Elias reads as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted individual forced to pay a price for his peace.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary ("hunger outvoted suspicion") rather than dramatized struggle. Elara functions as a benevolent archetype without internal contradiction or distinct flaws; her emotions are labeled ("tears to the old ones’ eyes") rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and directs the scene, but she lacks internal contradiction or resistance; the spiritual process proceeds linearly without a moment of doubt or competing impulse, making her agency feel low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias displays clear agency; his specific obsession with time drives the conflict, and his final choice forces a permanent, high-cost change. While his motivation is strong, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labeling ("monastic in its focus," "texture of time") rather than grounded emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is a clear, stoic archetype with a distinct goal, but the physical reality of her condition undermines immersion. The premise that she has survived being chained to a wall for ten years without severe atrophy or visible life-support strains credibility in a story aiming for gritty realism. Her interiority is somewhat abstract ("profound stillness"), prioritizing thematic signaling over embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear, specific obsession that drives the narrative. The internal landscape of his synesthesia is well-rendered, though the final realization ("monuments to survival") feels slightly rushed and diagnostic rather than fully earned through struggle on the page. The emotional resolution relies on a sudden shift in perspective that reads more as a summary of healing than the messy process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas is consistent but static; his internal state lacks the friction of contradictory impulses. The transition from thief to custodian feels frictionless and inevitable rather than earned through struggle or hard choice. The motivation is abstract and stated in exposition rather than dramatized through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s theatrical narration serves as a distinct, actionable coping mechanism that defines her voice. The shift from "frozen" repression to acceptance is clear, though the interiority relies on somewhat standard metaphorical mapping ("crystalline prison of grief") rather than fresh embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's competence feels dictated by plot needs rather than established traits; the sudden ability to decode a child's doodle via constellations lacks setup. The phobias are mentioned but discarded conveniently when the climax requires focus, undermining the character's internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kaelen functions effectively as a ritual vessel, but the diagnostic labeling of his "mild obsession" reduces character depth to a stated trait rather than dramatized desire. The internal landscape is consistent but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses or felt cost beyond the summary of being "worn smooth."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is tightly integrated with the loop mechanic; the shift from logical processing to intuitive risk-taking is earned by the "thousands of cycles" setup. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, transforming from a janitor of debris to a vessel of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's internal arc from suspicion to empathy is compelling, and the misinterpretation of the doodles reveals character well. The "mistrust" backstory feels slightly generic (a "warm, easy life" vs. "the accident") and relies on label-like phrasing ("thaw the frost") rather than dramatized specific friction in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, well-rendered archetype of the "wise artisan," but lacks internal contradiction or doubt; he is morally and philosophically correct from the start. The antagonist is a flat foil ("smile that never met her eyes"), and the conflict relies on static opposition rather than dynamic relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is rendered with distinct tactile grounding, and his internal shift at closure is earned by the scene's sensory focus. However, his defining trait ("obliging") renders him somewhat passive; he functions largely as the physical instrument for Aris's ambition rather than driving the scene through difficult choices or active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for the mystery; his "obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or high personal cost. While his shift from passive observer to active participant provides a basic arc, the internal landscape relies on stock somatic reactions ("heart hammering") rather than distinct psychological specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "fault-tolerant oracle" identity serves as a precise engine for the internal conflict, transforming a standard grief narrative into a character-specific study of paradox processing. The final choice to sustain the ambiguity is deeply rooted in this established trait, making the renunciation feel earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("My motivation for being here," "My recklessness was a familiar companion") rather than embodied experience. The "religiously skeptical" trait feels like a convenient label that crumbles instantly without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character motivation is visceral and drives the narrative arc effectively. The internal conflict between the crushing weight of duty and the need for self-preservation is dramatized well through the specific sensory overload of Aeridor.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    Characterization is functional but relies on archetypes; Elias is a flawless guide without internal friction or cost, while Lena serves primarily as a vessel for grief. Emotional beats are often summarized or labeled ("cautious exuberance," "desperate") rather than dramatized through distinct, conflicting behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s "sensitively perceptive" nature is well-dramatized through his tactile interaction with the artifacts, establishing strong interiority. While his motivation is clear, his agency is primarily interpretative—reading and reacting—until the final resignation, which limits the dynamism of the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct, competent focalizer, but his emotional interiority is cool and detached, lacking on-page struggle until the final decision. The transition from "orchestrator" to "traveler" is resolved via a quiet internal shift rather than a pressurized dilemma, making the resignation feel slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alistair is a distinct, engaging protagonist whose method—the loop pedal exorcism—provides specific, embodied characterization. However, the ending relies on a cliché "tired smile," and the antagonist's dialogue ("Stillness. Completion. Truth.") feels slightly stock. The character work is solid but lacks the deeper, contradictory nuance required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear but the internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labels like "chronologically homesick" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. The protagonist's struggle is primarily physical exhaustion rather than a difficult psychological trade-off; the solution (finding "optimism") feels like a convenient retrieval rather than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's struggle is internalized, but the motivation is delivered via diagnostic labels ("labyrinth of self") rather than embodied desire. The resolution hinges on a vague "memory" that lacks specific emotional grounding, making the final catharsis feel intellectually stated rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is defined primarily by backstory summary and labeled traits ("quiet, stubborn grace") rather than active choices under pressure. Her motivation is clear, but she faces no internal contradiction or decision-making difficulty in the scene; she merely executes a competent performance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a distinct, realized focalizer; his "fragile integrity" and obsession with data provide a specific filter for the world. The transition from passive observer to active investigator is earned through his specific trait of curiosity ("credibly curious nature"), though the explicit labeling of this trait is slightly less effective than the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with a clear internal contradiction (seeking a scent while being "aromatically cautious"). The "lantern broker" role serves as a strong thematic anchor for his preference for shadows, though it doesn't tactically shape his actions in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character traits are labeled rather than dramatized; the text explicitly states he is "ethically playful" and explains his motivation ("His singular motivation... was to discover") rather than allowing these to emerge from action. The internal landscape is summarized, creating distance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation ("quiet rebellion") is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or a hierarchy of values tested under pressure. The narrative treats her more as a vessel for the concept than a character making difficult choices; she moves from impulse to action without significant resistance or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is deeply integrated with the central conceit; Kael’s need to "fuse insight with empathy" drives the plot and justifies the cost he pays. His professional competence is balanced by the emotional burden he voluntarily shoulders, creating a compelling internal crucible. The distinction between his external craft and internal endurance is sharp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("motivation to uplift silent contributors") rather than dramatized through struggle. The protagonist's key decision—creating the grant—occurs off-page before the scene begins, rendering his on-page agency performative rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies on labeled abstractions ("warmth of the we") rather than embodied feeling. The trait "boldly sympathetic" is stated as a summary rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice, weakening the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a functional protagonist whose observation skills drive the pivot, but his interiority is somewhat generic. The shift from illustrator to wielder of a magical artifact obscures his personal agency; the pendant does much of the heavy lifting, reducing the need for difficult, character-defining micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s intellectualization of grief ("algorithm of his sorrow") creates a barrier to visceral engagement, rendering the emotion theoretical rather than embodied. The resolution feels slightly too tidy and diagnostic, lacking the erratic messiness of genuine loss.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a functional archetype whose motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation... was a simple one") rather than dramatized through struggle or internal contradiction. He operates with perfect competence and faces no genuine emotional or physical risk, making the stated "desperate gamble" feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Character motivation is clear and the internal pivot is earned by the scene's action. However, the interiority relies frequently on diagnostic labeling ("metamorphosis he did not want," "betrayal of the person") rather than fully embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, motivated focalizer with a clear internal drive ("thresh meaning") that pays off at closure. The protagonist's choice to trade the brooch is consistent with his established values, though the antagonist (the woman) functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character, relying on a convenient arrival to force the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyra's arc from protective guardian to accepting her own obsolescence is distinct and well-handled. Her internal conflict is the story's engine, though Kael serves more as a functional catalyst than a fully fleshed counter-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaelen acts as a functional vessel for the premise rather than a conflicted individual; he lacks contradictory impulses or a cost to his choices. His interiority is somewhat expository ("self-appointed task," "purpose reaffirmed"), explaining his state rather than dramatizing a struggle between competing needs. While his competence is clear, the absence of internal friction or a difficult micro-choice keeps him static.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction; his motivation is "absolute" from the start, leaving no room for doubt or struggle. He functions more as a vehicle for the plot than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The final acceptance feels like destiny fulfillment rather than a decision with a visibly dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias functions as a competent focalizer, but his arc from skeptic to believer relies on a sudden magical proof rather than an internally pressured evolution. The "sympathetic skeptic" profile feels stock, and his motivation ("honoring a dying wish") lacks a deeper, complicating counter-motive to create genuine friction before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Xylos has a clear, consistent motivation that successfully drives the narrative from stasis to action. The transition from ennui to purpose is well-charted, though the interiority occasionally leans on "bored immortal" stock phrases ("hollow hellos") rather than specific, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—an honest woman using her father’s grifter tools for restitution—is compelling and drives the narrative. The transition from "inexplicably honest" to expert forger is swift but anchored by the specific motivation of "mathematics of a fair trade."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a consistent, competent focalizer, and her motivation is clear. However, the emotional arc relies on labeled states ("anxious joy," "incandescent restraint") rather than embodied contradictory impulses, and she lacks an internal conflict that forces a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is rendered with compelling yearning, effectively dramatizing the abstract motivation of “building a soul.” While the entity is somewhat passive by design, the internal choice to engage with the woman’s grief provides sufficient agency to anchor the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s internal transition from "myth buster" to "restorer" is a compelling character arc that anchors the narrative. The specific emotional complexity of "gloomy cheerfulness" at the closure demonstrates a nuanced, embodied reaction to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael functions more as an archetype than a fully embodied character; his "dual allegiance" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page choice. His competence is high, but the lack of vulnerability or internal contradiction during the execution of the plan keeps him at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("deep... ache," "profound... melancholy") rather than embodied sensation. The protagonist faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices in the scene, resulting in a linear path to the goal without character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as an idealized archetype of the "disabled master" without internal contradiction or genuine flaws. Motivation is delivered via exposition ("simple and profound: to decode feedback") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices, resulting in a static character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias undergoes a distinct internal shift from a corrector of static maps to an archivist of a dynamic event, giving the piece a strong character arc. His motivation is singular and palpable, driving his persistence in the frozen outpost. The "mad motivation" provides excellent grounding for the surreal climax.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; he executes a ritual without internal contradiction, doubt, or personal stakes. His motivation is abstract ("necessity," "balance") rather than embodied, and he undergoes no emotional change or significant struggle, leaving him static.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("harness the ephemeral") is compelling and drives the narrative to a fatal conclusion. The internal conflict between survival instinct and obsessive purpose is well-dramatized. However, emotional interiority occasionally relies on melodramatic shorthand ("primal scream," "agony seized my limbs") rather than fresh, embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to find a truth of his own is compelling, and the final choice to destroy the evidence to preserve that truth is a sophisticated, earned character beat. However, the score is capped by the High-Band Entry Gate due to line-level flaws in Q7. The interiority is strong, but the technical execution prevents a higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel who observes and receives rather than deciding or acting. He undergoes no internal struggle; the "purpose" and "knowledge" are delivered to him by the ghost and the bead without an earned on-page cost. The interiority relies on external memory insertion rather than character-specific processing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's agency is effectively suspended during the middle section ("sleepwalking"), reducing the narrative to a passive chronicle of magical events until the storm wakes him. His defining trait, "hauntingly optimistic," acts as a label rather than a driver of difficult, conscious choices in the first half.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character motivation is explicitly labeled ("simple, yet immense") rather than dramatized through pressure or specific behavior. The internal void ("profound hollowness") reads as a diagnostic summary, and the emotional resolution feels unearned because the internal struggle is summarized rather than fought on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kaelen functions as a highly competent vehicle for the concept rather than a character under pressure; he faces no internal conflict, doubt, or genuine risk. The text relies on assertional labels like "masterpiece" and "focused grace" to define his capability instead of dramatizing struggle or high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s "disguise of foolishness" is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told how others see her, but we do not witness a specific interaction where she actively performs this deception to bypass a threat. Her interiority is rich, but the "adjacent possibilities" trait feels more like expository flavor for standard deduction than a distinct character engine.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a competent focalizer, but her weariness feels more like a trait checklist than embodied struggle. Kael remains a cipher until the climax, where his emotional reaction is summarized rather than demonstrated through behavior. The relationship is functional but lacks dynamic tension beyond the client-provider frame.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is drawn with consistent interiority, though his motivation functions more as a thematic vehicle than a visceral need. The "lotus-hearted" introspection feels slightly performative, distancing the reader from his immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is stated explicitly ("simple... to rediscover lost joy") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or behavior. The character arc is a linear progression from lack to fulfillment via a tool, lacking a crucible of choice or genuine internal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, competent protagonist whose "methodical play" drives the narrative interaction with the surreal setting. However, his acceptance of the reality shift is too smooth ("exhilarating"), lacking the internal friction or genuine struggle that would heighten the emotional stakes of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen acts decisively, but his "charm" is asserted rather than dramatized in the brief interaction. The shift to "raw steel" is functional, but his willingness to potentially "wipe a dozen city blocks" of consciousness is treated with a casualness that undercuts the moral weight of his "spark of defiance."

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara functions as a symbolic archetype of the suffering artist rather than a fleshed-out character; her internal life is described through abstract metaphors ("metabolize her sorrow") rather than embodied emotion. She lacks agency for the majority of the text, merely enduring until an unprompted internal shift occurs, creating a lack of active struggle or contradictory impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian is a coherent, melancholic archetype who fits the atmospheric mode, but he lacks active agency or a dilemma that forces a difficult choice beyond the execution of a routine duty.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the protagonist's "recklessness" is told rather than dramatized through a choice that goes wrong or creates collateral damage. Elara functions primarily as a recipient of the magical resolution rather than an active participant until the final gesture, limiting the relational dynamic. The emotional resolution feels smoothed over by the magic, bypassing the friction of genuine interpersonal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear, but his emotional arc relies on a convenient external discovery (the letters) rather than a high-stakes internal struggle or active choice that forces growth. The father’s transition from cold antagonist to loving protector is delivered via exposition in the found letters, summarizing the emotional payload rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Character motivation is distinct and poignant, anchored in the specific ritual of the dust mapping and the "paper trails" of music. The shift from the defensive lying ("pearl diver") to the vulnerability of the confession is earned by the pressure of the storm. Elias's internal state is well-dramatized through action rather than just summary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s internal arc from "lost child" to navigator is convincing and drives the narrative logic. The motivation to understand "sacred thresholds" over merely returning home effectively complicates his desire, though the interiority occasionally leans on abstract summaries of feeling rather than visceral child-perspective experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Character motivations are legible, but Elara's transformation from "curt skeptic" to weeping with "newfound understanding" is unearned and abrupt. The emotional shift relies on a stock reaction to beauty rather than a specific, dramatized relationship dynamic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael functions efficiently as a narrative device to solve the puzzle but lacks deep interiority or contradictory impulses. The resolution relies on a "sudden spark of intuition" rather than a trait-driven choice under pressure, and there is no personal cost or renunciation to give weight to the character's success.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character; his competence is absolute, facing no internal doubt, limits, or meaningful struggle. While his motivation is stated ("serenade monotony"), it lacks emotional texture or personal stakes, resulting in a performance without a felt human cost. The absence of "blind spots" or contradictory impulses makes the execution feel mechanical rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is legible, but the internal conflict resolves too smoothly via a shift in focus without visible cost or grit. The emotional arc leans on high-concept labels ("profound weight") rather than embodied struggle, making the transformation feel more performative than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated via summary ("to illuminate value in the mundane") rather than dramatized through pressure. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction; he moves from "quiet tension" to "profound peace" without a genuine struggle or cost, making the resolution feel unearned. The use of diagnostic labels ("reflective man by trade and by nature") creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization is competent but relies on archetypes (gruff mentor, eager rookie) and explicit authorial telling ("This was Elias's ultimate purpose") rather than dramatized friction. Kaelen lacks agency, serving merely as a prompt for Elias's monologue, which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is competent but static; she functions as a technician of the plot rather than a character under pressure. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; her "lucidly watchful" nature feels like a label for efficiency rather than a trait that costs her something. The narrative lacks a moment where she must weigh a personal trade-off, resulting in a low-friction "competence porn" dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s professional detachment is compelling, and her final choice to abstract the tragedy on her map effectively defines her character. However, her interiority often relies on summarized emotion ("felt the weight of that confession") rather than embodied reaction, creating distance during key discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is a cipher who functions as a plot device rather than a character. He faces no internal conflict, makes no difficult choices, and pays no personal cost; his "borrowed heartbeat" is a mechanic, not a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but the antagonists are reduced to archetypes ("masks of granite") whose sudden capitulation feels convenient rather than earned by deep character logic. The internal landscape relies on broad assertions of "nervousness" and "exhaustion" rather than specific, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the "secretly sentimental" trait relies heavily on expository labeling ("He was secretly sentimental, a flaw he had buried") rather than dramatic enactment prior to the climax. While the trembling fingers offer some embodied emotion, the shift from "ruthless pragmatism" to this poetic act of penance feels slightly abrupt and theoretical rather than viscerally earned in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara functions more as an ethereal archetype than a living character; her "perfect control" and "unbroken seal" distance the reader from any genuine internal struggle. The emotional burden she carries is asserted through abstract labels ("profound and alarming serenity") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation and internal conflict are legible, and the shift from "serene" defense to proactive guilt drives the narrative effectively. However, the characterization relies on adjectival labeling ("urbane manner," "uncommonly serene," "intense focus") rather than purely dramatized behavior to establish traits. The internal pivot is earned, but the reliance on summary descriptions for his emotional state keeps the reader at a slight remove.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is consistently drawn as a reverent observer, and his actions align perfectly with his "esoteric realist" persona. However, the characterization lacks internal friction or a crucible; his task proceeds without doubt or contradictory impulses, resulting in a competent but emotionally static portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is consistent but static, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene. Emotions are labeled with abstract summary ("quiet peace," "snowmelt ardor") rather than embodied through difficult choices or reactions to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s specific cognitive condition—perceiving only memory and premonition—is dramatized excellently, turning a prompt constraint into a lived reality that dictates his interiority and tactics. The choice to consume the seal is earned through the "starvation" of his present moment, making the transcendence feel like a necessary character evolution rather than just a plot beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kavi is a coherent archetype, but his defining trait ("frugality") functions more as a thematic justification for the ending than a source of behavioral friction in the scene. He faces no difficult tactical choices or moments of doubt; the ritual is a smooth execution of a pre-existing desire, lacking internal conflict or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character; her "singular purpose" leaves no room for internal conflict or doubt. The "scheming pacifist" trait is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through complex, contradictory choices. Her final sacrifice feels like a genre trope (the fading guardian) rather than a cost earned by specific personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s internal arc from desperate longing to "familiar comfort" is compelling and fully earned by the on-page ritual. The shift in her relationship to the dream—from a runaway thing to a readable map—provides deep, character-specific closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s internal conflict between tradition and necessity is well-rendered, and his quartz-eye provides a distinct, embodied mode of perception. The emotional pivot relies slightly on the convenience of "accidental wisdom" rather than an active struggle to change his mind, but the physical surrender of the ribbon grounds the arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen is clearly drawn, and his internal conflict—the compulsion to know versus the mandate to ignore—is well-established. However, the epiphany arrives largely through intellectual processing rather than a high-stakes behavioral choice or error, making him feel slightly more like a vessel for the concept than a fully embodied agent under pressure. The emotional cost ("terrible clarity") is stated more than felt through resistance or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation shifts clearly, but the transition from scholar to savior is summarized ("That all changed") rather than dramatized in the moment. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("frantic beat of her own heart") rather than character-specific embodiment. Kael functions more as a plot device than a character, reducing the relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling, and the internal conflict between her identity and the ghost’s is well-staged. However, interiority relies heavily on labeled emotion ("blissfully aberrant peace," "strange sense of trapped freedom") rather than embodied sensation. The "medical marvel" backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias is a distinct, competent professional whose actions perfectly align with his "warmly methodical" nature, but he lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. The resolution requires labor rather than a difficult choice or personal cost, resulting in a character who feels fully formed but static under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen is a clearly defined, competent protagonist with a legible goal, but his journey lacks internal contradiction or psychological cost. He functions primarily as a role (mapkeeper) executing a procedure rather than a character forced to make a difficult trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and consistent, driven by a specific obsession with the beacon. However, the "retrocognitively blessed" trait relies on expository labeling rather than active demonstration until the climax, and the "curse" aspect feels stated rather than dramatized through interpersonal or physical cost. The internal conflict ("resolve wavered") is resolved somewhat too neatly, lacking the lingering ambiguity of a high-band character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s internal arc is compelling, moving from a passive curator of "what was" to an active guardian of "what wasn't." His defining trait ("preemptively nostalgic") is established through exposition rather than action initially, but it effectively colors his emotional reaction to the climax. The final choice to record the "impossible choice" rather than fix it demonstrates strong agency and integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's professional lens (chemicals, color formulas) creates a distinct, grounded interiority that creates a specific worldview. Motivation is clear and drives agency, though the interior monologue occasionally leans into abstract sentiment ("gravity of hopelessness") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character interiority is dense and specific, effectively filtering the breakup through Elara's "chronicler" persona. The shift from pain to analytical acceptance fits her established traits, though the emotional resolution feels slightly tidy and swift, bordering on therapeutic rationalization rather than messy human grief.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s internal conflict—claustrophobia versus the need for expansion—is clearly defined and drives the narrative arc. However, motivation is often summarized ("Elian’s only motivation was...") rather than emerging solely through action, which creates a slight distance in the opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian functions more as a thematic device than a character; he faces no internal contradiction, difficulty, or cost in achieving his goal. His nature is delivered via diagnostic labels ("fluidly logical instrument") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. The interaction with the passenger lacks genuine status struggle or emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara functions as a competent archeologist rather than a character under pressure; she solves the puzzle without hesitation or internal conflict. Her motivation is clear, but she undergoes no emotional change, and the attribute "wisely adventurous" is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through risky choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation ("taking their air away" to teach breathing) adds a compelling, jagged edge to her character, elevating her beyond a generic healer. However, Liam serves primarily as a reactive prop to demonstrate her agency, limiting the relational dynamic to a one-way rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor effectively grounds her motivation, providing a distinct, gritty counterweight to the abstract threat. However, her resistance to the "cosmic scale" pitch feels slightly predetermined by this backstory rather than actively struggled for in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on summarized emotion ("love so fierce," "distilled emotion") rather than embodied feeling. The realization at the end feels like an intellectual download rather than a visceral, character-driven change; she is a vessel for the revelation rather than an active participant in a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen is a compelling, competent archetype whose stoic dedication fits the "guardian" role perfectly. While his motivation is clear and embodied in action, the lack of significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits the character depth slightly below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation ("magnify small kindnesses") aligns well with action, but the backstory of "Thomas" functions as a label for grief rather than a felt pressure. The transition to the final emotional state is summarized ("felt... tactfully hopeful") rather than earned through a high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on summarized abstractions ("tyranny of indifference") rather than embodied struggle. The "underestimated" trait is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through specific interactions or near-misses that prove it.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("dread," "nostalgia") rather than embodied contradiction. Elias functions as a competent archetype fulfilling a duty, lacking a complex internal struggle or distinct flaw that complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elian serves as a functional vessel for the prophecy rather than a complex agent with contradictory impulses. His motivation is stated ("consuming motivation") but not dramatized through struggle or trade-offs; he obeys the folklore without hesitation or internal cost. The transformation at the end feels like an unearned reward rather than a consequence of character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with consistent traits (tinkerer, observer), but his motivation is largely summarized rather than dramatized through friction. The "magnetism" driving him removes agency from the early beats, and the profound internal shift at the end feels asserted in the narration rather than earned through a visible struggle with his need for order.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's internal struggle is palpable and grounded in action, with a clear motivation driving the ritual. However, the use of reagents like "cobalt for memory, viridian for regret" relies on reductive emotional labeling rather than embodied feeling in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Silas is a functional protagonist, but his interiority is limited to expository labels rather than felt contradiction. The interaction with the spirit lacks genuine friction; she yields to his first significant attempt, making his success feel inevitable rather than earned through character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("proprioceptively enhanced state," "conditioned terror"), which creates emotional distance and triggers the rubric's specific deduction for this flaw. While the shift from victim to researcher is a clear stance change, the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a living person making difficult choices under pressure. The internal monologue is analytical to a fault, dampening the visceral impact of his trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vehicle for the magical process rather than a fully realized character with internal contradictions. Motivation is explicitly stated ("My motivation had never wavered") rather than dramatized through conflict or doubt. The emotional landscape is ethereal and abstract ("smoke you could almost hold") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Leo’s specific obsession with ceilings and his "weightless burden" provide a distinct, engaging character hook. However, the emotional arc relies on a convenient "vision" upon touching the object to generate empathy and resolve the ghost's story, rather than earned interaction or struggle. The internal conflict is mild; the "choice" to engage feels inevitable rather than pressurized by a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Operator functions as a competent archetype rather than a fully realized character, executing a grand plan without internal conflict or doubt. While the motivation is clear ("compress eternity"), the lack of "blind spots," contradictory impulses, or emotional struggle reduces dramatic friction. The character triumphs without a moment of vulnerability or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen's internal landscape is rendered with specific, thematic details ("caesura in a line of forgotten verse") that align well with the baroque setting. The shift from "defunct" resignation to a "quiet war" provides a clear arc, though the emotional realization relies on a sentimental vision rather than an earned internal struggle or hard choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his internal struggle feels schematic. The pivot from existential doubt to conviction happens too rapidly and conveniently to register as a genuine psychological hurdle. The resolution relies on a simple affirmation of identity rather than a complex emotional trade-off or realized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict between her role as a collector (cataloging) and her motivation (seeking the inexplicable) resolves beautifully in the final renunciation. The choice to leave the compass and the scent unbottled is a decisive, character-specific act that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a nuanced character; her shift from artist to "custodian" is instantaneous and lacks internal friction. The motivation is stated rather than dramatized, and she solves the crisis without a personal cost or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is asserted via summary ("question that had taken root in her soul") rather than dramatized through costly choices or conflicting impulses. Her journey lacks internal opposition; she merely wants to know and succeeds without confronting a genuine flaw or limitation. The revelation about the grandmother is a convenient inheritance rather than an earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s internal conflict—the scholar’s need for truth versus the emotional toll of the reverie—is excellently dramatized. The climax hinges on a character-specific realization (shifting from interrogation to memorial), earning the breakthrough via a profound change in stance rather than a generic skill check.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and drives the central action, rooting the magic system in his refusal of "false comfort." However, the internal conflict is resolved somewhat easily by will alone, and emotional states are frequently labeled ("temptation of despair," "profound emptiness") rather than fully embodied in behavior or micro-choices before the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian represents a profound integration of character and plot; his specific vocation acts as both the catalyst for the crisis and the lens for the tragic realization. The internal pivot from archivist to eraser creates a devastating, earned cost that redefines his identity in the final beat. His agency is active—he investigates, decodes, and decides—driving the narrative cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted agent; she faces no internal contradiction or temptation to abandon her task. Her "furiously tranquil" state is asserted as a trait rather than dramatized as a struggle against the chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but he lacks internal conflict or doubt during the crisis. His certainty from the start flattens the emotional arc, resulting in a protagonist who executes a procedure rather than wrestling with a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated explicitly ("His motivation was a deeply personal secret: to find strength in vulnerability") rather than emerging organically through conflict. While the shift from observer to participant is a clear choice, the interiority relies on summarized labels ("yearned," "wondered") instead of embodied, contradictory emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's central motivation ("to preserve the weight of unspoken words") is delivered via abstract exposition rather than dramatized through struggle or conflicting desires. While the "astonished" trait is established, it feels more like a label than a driver of behavior, and his internal transition to acceptance lacks visible on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is a clearly defined, melancholic focalizer with a specific internal landscape. His motivation—to understand the "texture" of time—is distinct and drives the central tactic (the garage sale). However, his internal conflict is relatively low-friction; the anxiety of "borrowed time" is stated but lacks an on-page choice where he must trade safety or resources for his goal. He succeeds largely by waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kaelen is a passive observer whose emotions are aestheticized ("perfect shard of sorrow") rather than felt. He lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his reaction to the child's distress is to instantly retreat into safe, philosophical abstraction without paying a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a competent agent of the plot but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; his acceptance of death is immediate and absolute. He functions as a singular vector of will rather than a complex character navigating a dilemma, which flattens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exemplary; Aris's internal conflict between academic skepticism and the primal need for connection is dramatized through specific perceptions. The sacrifice of the amber is a credible, earned renunciation of his isolation, grounded in the immediate scene rather than abstract summary. The shift from observer to participant feels psychologically inevitable given the established interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is consistent and distinct, functioning well as a mythic archetype. However, motivation is delivered via exposition ("His motivation was simple...") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices. The character feels like a vessel for the ritual rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Barrow is characterized with excellent sensory specificity and agency, serving as a distinct and vital presence. Elara’s motivation, however, is delivered via explicit exposition using the prompt phrase ("translate distance into closeness") rather than being fully dramatized in her choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara is defined largely by labels ("blessed pariah") and expository interiority rather than behavior. The emotional resolution relies on diagnostic self-analysis ("confusion hadn't been a flaw") rather than a dramatized shift through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.1)
    Kael functions as an archetype defined by labels ("apprentice of wonder") rather than embodied struggle. His success is guaranteed by competence without on-page cost, and the antagonist converts instantly without believable resistance. Interiority relies on abstract philosophy rather than felt conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal arc—from a paid pretender to a witness of "absolute truth"—is compelling and vividly rendered. Her motivation to chronicle "small gestures" provides a strong, character-specific engine for the plot, and the climax feels like a necessary evolution of her identity rather than a convenient plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on diagnostic labels ("profound belonging," "quiet motivation") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. The character's struggle is articulated through abstract metaphors ("hidden thunder") rather than demonstrated through specific, costly micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is sharply defined and drives the narrative; the internal flaw (pride/perfectionism) is effectively dramatized. The shift from guilt to self-forgiveness is earned through the scene's focus, though the final emotional realization feels slightly rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to challenge the silence is clear and drives the plot, but the "innocently mischievous" trait appears as an inserted label rather than embodied behavior. Kael serves as a functional prop to voice fear, lacking genuine interpersonal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's internal doubt is well-established, but her progression lacks a moment of failure or genuine incompetence to validate the "grace of doubt" label; she succeeds at every step. The transition from uncertainty to a "surge born of love" feels slightly unearned by the prior struggle, resolving the internal arc with a convenient emotional pivot rather than a hard-won tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is consistently drawn as a grieving artist, and his perception of the world through color and light provides a stable interiority. However, his grief feels slightly performative and safe, relying on "painterly" observation rather than raw, contradictory emotion or messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.3)
    Internal conflict is replaced by high-intensity labeling ('agony of love,' 'screaming tenderness') that feels unearned given the protagonist's lack of specific connection to the ship. The emotion is performed rather than embodied, and the lack of an active on-page counterpart leaves the protagonist’s stance untested by social pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is grounded in the "geography of loss," but interiority relies on abstract metaphors (e.g., "compass needle") rather than specific, embodied memory. The emotional shift at the end feels slightly unearned due to the lack of interpersonal or internal struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is a tightly drawn protagonist whose affliction (compulsive honesty) serves as a distinct, tangible constraint on every interaction. His choice to use the relic is actively motivated by a desperate need for psychological safety, and the internal cost—trading a warm memory for a "walled" silence—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.7)
    Silas is defined by a supernatural convenience ("borrowed memories") rather than active character traits or difficult choices. His primary action—holding a flower—is passive, and his "compulsion" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. He functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concept than a fully realized protagonist with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist; his "empirically intuitive" nature bridges the gap between the mundane (ants) and the magical effectively. The internal ache of loneliness is embodied well in his actions ("patience of a glacier"), though the shift to total peace at the end feels slightly rapid given the depth of his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and the pivot from escapism to duty is distinct. However, the internal journey relies on stock metaphors ("gilded cage," "hollow ceremonies") and the "strength she didn't know she possessed" beat is a cliché that simplifies the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s internal pivot from rigid intellect to emotional vulnerability is well-charted and serves as the story’s engine. Kael functions primarily as a catalyst for this change rather than a fully realized agent; his "fading" is atmospheric but slightly vague in its mechanics. The emotional logic holds, though the "power of love" resolution leans on a familiar trope rather than a unique character-specific innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is vivid, grounded in the specific "chronological confusion" and "jealousy" traits. However, the pivot from savage envy to enlightened acceptance relies heavily on a sudden trance state ("something inside me snapped") rather than a deliberate, pressurized choice in the waking world. The resolution feels slightly more visited upon the character than earned by their agency.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal landscape is drawn with precision; the "scentless void" provides a tangible cost that anchors her new ability. The shift from grief to acceptance is earned through the specific action of the story rather than just summary. The emotional logic holds, though the transition from aromatherapist to psychometrist feels slightly convenient for the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s internal conflict is clear, but the pivot to the grandmother's memory feels slightly convenient. The climax relies on therapy-speak labels ("Hesitation," "Pride") rather than idiosyncratic character insights, creating a generic emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Julian’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, but his internal arc resolves through summary ("profound acceptance") rather than a specific dramatized micro-choice. The "deluge" of sensation is described with abstract labels ("bitter taste," "heartbreaking strain") rather than particularized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific individual, functioning as a vehicle for the concept rather than a living consciousness under pressure. Motivation is clear but static; she desires unification without any dramatized resistance or internal cost, making her surrender feel inevitable rather than earned. The emotional landscape is abstract ("felt the truth," "unravel cosmic illusions") rather than embodied in visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary, with Elias’s "peculiar" internal landscape driving the narrative logic. The shift from a technician obsessing over precision to a witness accepting a flaw is deeply motivated by his established backstory (the grandfather’s key, the desire to understand time). The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the ritual and the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s motivation is clearly established and rooted in backstory, but his emotional struggle is resolved primarily through technical competence rather than a difficult, costly choice in the scene. The moment of release feels earned by the device rather than a strenuous internal overcoming.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is established early, but the protagonist's transformation is summarized ("weeks, she journeyed... began to solve") rather than dramatized in scene. The internal pivot from rigid academic to intuitive explorer happens largely in exposition, reducing the emotional weight of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas functions as a consistent, archetypal catalyst, maintaining "Earned Stasis" through his isolation. However, his lack of internal conflict or personal stakes beyond professional duty limits emotional depth; he operates more as a device than a fully realized character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a character with competing desires; her "instinct that defied logic" replaces active decision-making at the climax. The emotional resolution is observational rather than earned through interpersonal struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's transition from an elusive manipulator to a vulnerable participant creates a compelling arc. However, some interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("quiet desperation," "ingrained suspicion") rather than embodied experience in the peak moments, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kaelen is a clearly defined protagonist with a consistent internal state, but his grief remains largely abstract—a label ("Elara’s passing") rather than a felt, embodied reality acting on the present moment. The resolution of this grief ("smoothed into a bearable, known shape") feels somewhat tidy and therapeutic, lacking the gritty cost or contradiction required for higher bands. The emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative arc effectively. The internal conflict between guilt and acceptance is well-staged, though the pivotal epiphany feels slightly rushed and relies on a familiar trope ("erasing the pain erases the self") rather than a unique character-specific realization.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elian functions more as an archetype of the "tortured artist" than a complex character; he lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses. His motivation is singular and lofty, and while consistent, it does not force him to make difficult tradeoffs; he simply obeys the muse/ritual without doubt or error.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—grief transmuting into preservation—is compelling and clearly anchors the narrative arc. The shift from "arsonist" to "curator" provides a satisfying internal reconfiguration. However, the attribute "analytically intuitive" is told rather than dramatized through complex behavior, serving more as a functional label to explain puzzle-solving skills.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply defined by the "entangled memory" premise, driving a clear emotional arc from suppressed grief to creative expression. The "living ghost" and "guinea pig" labels are slightly standard, but her internal state is rendered with specific, embodied detail that earns the final realization of the "duet for one."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas is a "competence porn" archetype who faces no internal friction, doubt, or limitation; he outclasses the antagonist effortlessly. The lack of vulnerability or error makes the character static, and he pays no emotional or physical price for his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen functions as a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; they possess "ancient patience" and "absolute resolve" but face no internal contradiction or genuine risk. The emotional arc is static—perfect empathy applied to a problem—resulting in a lack of visible, felt cost or personal struggle essential for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a functional archetype of the "wise mentor," but lacks internal friction or personal cost beyond the general atmospheric danger. His identity as a "chess coach" is purely nominal, failing to inform his tactics or worldview beyond a single metaphor. The lack of embodied struggle against the attribute (which acts as a convenient superpower) flattens the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is externalized to magical objects; Elara's opposition dissolves not through interaction but because the scrimshaw "unlocks guarded hearts." Kaelen lacks internal conflict, functioning as an archetype of the dreamer without the necessary grit or doubt to make his departure earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's internal division between his "curated blank" mask and his private ritual is compelling and drives the scene. However, the narrative relies heavily on expository interiority (e.g., "Grief had become a contraband emotion") to define his motivation rather than trusting the dramatized ritual to convey it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his journey is a linear success without resistance. The epiphany comes without a visible personal cost or struggle, making him feel more like a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure. The motivation is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elian functions primarily as a plot device to solve the external problem; he lacks internal contradiction or a moment of difficult choice. The attribute "innocently cunning" is told rather than dramatized through complex behavior. Vex serves as a stock figure of despair without agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elian functions as a generic archetype without internal contradiction or distinct voice; his primary trait, a "powerfully gentle strength," is told via label rather than enacted through complex choice. The emotional arc is linear, lacking the friction of genuine struggle or embodied cost necessary to make the pilgrimage feel earned. Internal experience is largely summarized with abstract descriptors ("reverence," "anticipation") rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's shift from debilitating grief to active mentor is abrupt ("sudden, sharp need"), lacking dramatized internal friction or reluctance. While his actions are consistent, the role of "magical helper" feels assumed for plot convenience rather than earned through character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara functions well as a thematic archetype ("architect of understanding"), but she lacks internal contradiction or a high-stakes micro-choice that tests her resolve on the page. Julian serves as a functional foil without distinct agency beyond his initial question.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is defined, but the protagonist's success relies on "unconscious preparation" and innate aptitude rather than a difficult choice made under pressure. The transition from academic detachment to "agony" is swift and told rather than fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael's specific trait ("dusk noticer") is expertly utilized to drive the plot's central discovery, satisfying the "competence under pressure" requirement. Motivation is clear, though the interiority occasionally leans on abstract labels ("shape of hope") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence, and his connection to the wildlife is beautifully drawn. However, the pivotal internal shift is handled through diagnostic summary ("The first layer to go was the hot, consuming anger... Next came the brittle shell") rather than dramatized struggle, which distances the reader from the cost of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal drive is fiercely specific and governs every on-page beat. The shift from closure-seeker to scar-archivist is an Earned Stasis that feels psychologically inevitable given the excavation of the wound. The “accidental telepathy” is integrated not just as a power, but as a foil that challenges his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she encounters no resistance and makes no difficult choices. Her motivation is abstract, and her internal state is described rather than dramatized through action under pressure. The character serves merely as a camera for the flashback.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly established, but her internal arc relies on a convenient epiphany rather than a pressure-tested choice. The transition from torment to "ecstatic clarity" happens instantaneously without a visible psychological or emotional cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kaelen’s competence is compelling, and the arc from dreamless to dreaming provides a clear internal shift. The motivation to "cultivate" rather than erase drives the pivotal choice effectively. However, the "dreamless" trait feels more like a stated condition than a felt constraint during the rising action; the protagonist succeeds through mastery without hitting a moment of visceral personal limitation or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophy than as a living, contradictory figure. The climax relies on "diagnostic label-speak" ("hum of insight," "sensory signature") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the realization. The internal conflict is resolved too smoothly, lacking the friction of genuine resistance or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a specific individual; her "life of careful steps" lacks concrete grounding. The epiphany at the end is summarized ("Elara finally understood") rather than earned through a difficult, high-stakes choice on the page. Interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("hollow ache") rather than specific memory or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias is a deeply realized focalizer whose enforced silence transforms from a symptom into an active choice. The internal contradiction between the safety of the fortress and the need for redemption drives a clear, earned hierarchy of values, culminating in the "act of will" to stay. The physical manifestation of his guilt (the bolt) and his injury (nerve regeneration) perfectly embody his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael functions as a plot device rather than a character under pressure; his motivation is stated ("balance") rather than felt through conflicting impulses. The attribute "regally unpretentious" serves as a direct label rather than a demonstrated trait, and his weariness feels like atmospheric coloring rather than a flaw that complicates his task. There is no moment where his competence is tested or his resolve wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.5)
    Aris acts as a functional vehicle for the concept but lacks deep internal friction; his motivation is stated via adjectives ("quiet, desperate need") rather than dramatized choice. The pivotal breakthrough—noticing a symbol on a map he has studied for years—undercuts his competence as an obsessive researcher, reading as a convenient plot device rather than an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with a clear objective, but her interiority relies on stated motivation ("singular motivation was to discover meaning") rather than conflicting impulses. The transition from "awkwardly confident" to "virtuoso" feels convenient, lacking a dramatized internal struggle or distinct psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent agent of the plot, but she lacks internal friction or a "crucible" moment. Her motivation is stated through exposition ("believed predictability was just another name for stagnation") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or doubt. She succeeds without paying a personal price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character motivation is anchored in a clear, traumatic backstory that drives the present-moment conflict. The physiological response to the trigger is well-dramatized, effectively moving beyond the brief clinical slip ("somatic markers") into embodied sensation ("ice bloomed," "jaw tightened").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal logic is strong; Elias’s shift from fragmentation to "cartographer" is earned through specific, tactile action. The resolution leans slightly toward therapeutic idealization ("gentle, knowing glow") rather than a jagged, costly trade-off, but the motivation to descend is distinct and drives the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael's decision to ignore the rescue efforts in favor of his obsession provides a sharp, defining character beat that establishes his alien priorities. However, his internal state relies on oxymoronic labels ("serene anger," "quiet, holy rage") rather than embodied emotion, making his interiority feel performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara's internal state relies on diagnostic labels like "bravely conflicted" rather than dramatized struggle. The rapid shift from lifelong preservationist to seditionist feels summarized, lacking sufficient on-page friction to earn the profound betrayal she feels.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is clearly defined, and her pacifist stance is active rather than passive, leading to a decisive renunciation (Earned Stasis). However, the specific attribute of being "senselessly perceptive" feels somewhat partitioned from the climax; while she perceives the "phantom memory," the decision relies more on established values than this specific sensory gift. The contrast between her nature and her father’s is strong, though the father’s presence is established through exposition rather than interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kaelen is defined by "cool-headed patience," which unfortunately acts as a buffer against genuine struggle; he observes rather than agonizing over choices. While his motivation is singular and drives the action, his emotional interiority is abstract ("mind a placid lake") rather than embodied. He resolves the "impossible task" through innate ability rather than a costly trade-off or adaptation, resulting in a competence-heavy, low-vulnerability arc.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste is drawn with sharp, competent strokes, and her internal motivation—protecting the private truth over the public image—is compelling. The emotional landscape of her relationship with her father is specific and embodied ("flinched at the scent of rain"). However, the lack of hesitation or internal struggle during the confrontation makes her feel slightly impenetrable; she dominates the antagonist so thoroughly that her own vulnerability is obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is clear, but the backstory of finding letters "from another life" is confusing and underdeveloped, serving as a convenient plot device rather than deepening the character. The emotional resolution feels somewhat performative rather than a hard-won internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions primarily as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; her motivation ("to discover meaning in the mess") is abstract and explicitly told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. While her action to create art is clear, traits like "whimsy" and "socially perceptive" are applied as labels rather than demonstrated through friction or error. The lack of internal conflict or hesitation makes her progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen is a competent, sharply defined protagonist with a clear "gentle radical" ethos. His internal landscape is well-drawn, though his lack of hesitation or struggle against the "hollow ache" makes him feel more like a functionary than a character under severe pressure. The emotional cost is stated ("hollow ache") rather than fully dramatized in a way that impedes his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    Julian’s motivation ("change the ending") is clear and drives the scene, but Elara functions largely as a prop for his intervention rather than a fully agentic counterweight. The emotional progression is linear, lacking the internal friction or conflicting impulses that would push this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer; his "affectionate skeptic" trait is not just a label but the engine of the conflict and resolution. His choice to suspend disbelief to forge a language with Lena drives the narrative. The internal contradiction between his logical mind and his protective love is dramatized beautifully in the painting process.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is defined by a stated "deep need" rather than dramatized struggle; her transition from analytical to mystical is smooth and lacks internal resistance. The climax relies on her simply "letting go" without a visible cost or moment of doubt, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned by character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen demonstrates clear agency and a Decisive Change at the closure, but his internal landscape lacks contradiction; he is singular in purpose from the start without competing impulses to create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's internal landscape of guilt and professional paranoia is consistent and drives the scene. The "unused courage" motivation feels slightly abstract and literary rather than viscerally embodied, but the tactile grounding with the pillbox helps anchor his state.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak to resolve the conflict ("The promise was not... It was the ache") rather than embodied struggle. The realization feels like a summarized epiphany rather than a hard-won emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen is consistent but lacks the internal contradiction required for depth; his key action is described as "instinct, unthinking and pure," which bypasses conscious agency and struggle. He functions more as an archetypal vehicle for the theme than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is consistent and her motivation is clear, but her internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses or "jagged edges" of high-tier characterization. The trait "wistfully pragmatic" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult trade-off, and her "protected vulnerability" is diagnosed by the narrator rather than felt through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s internal state is vivid, but his emotional arc resolves through a sudden realization rather than a struggle with distinct costs. The transition from feeling caged to independent via a single vision feels structurally convenient rather than earned by character-driven tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's profession as a ghostwriter effectively grounds the internal conflict of borrowed versus authentic emotion. However, the stakes of her decision rely heavily on abstract labeling ("library of longing," "kinship and terror") rather than embodied symptoms of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a competent and active protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal landscape relies on stock physical markers ("knot of dread," "heart hammering") rather than specific, contradictory character friction. She faces the external threat with heroic resolve, but the absence of a difficult internal trade-off or doubt limits the depth of the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.1)
    Character motivation is clear, but traits function as labels ("prudently adventurous") rather than drivers of specific choices; entering the ruin feels reckless, contradicting the label. Interiority relies on somatic clichés ("breath hitched," "sanity fraying") rather than distinct psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is a distinct, compelling protagonist whose condition (prosopagnosia) is functionally integrated into his motivation and method, not just a label. The internal struggle—seeking empathy through a mechanical process—is dramatized well through action. The emotional breakthrough feels earned by the ritual, though the internal shift is slightly over-explained in the narration rather than left fully implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated ("simple and all-consuming") rather than dramatized through struggle or internal contradiction. The assigned attribute "nervously confident" functions as a label that removes hesitation, resulting in a character who moves efficiently through the plot without making difficult, high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s shift from resignation to active attempts at "pixelated amnesty" is motivated and credible. The internal conflict is vivid, though the diagnostic labeling of his "dynamically observant" trait creates a momentary stutter in the otherwise strong "show" of his character.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his "polished calm" acts as armor that prevents genuine vulnerability or internal conflict on the page. He navigates the external threat with high competence and no visible emotional cost or difficult trade-off, making the victory feel unearned by character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies on stock phrasing ("swirling chaos," "weary resignation") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The "unique attribute" of healing through writing feels convenient and told rather than dramatized through pressure. The emotional arc is linear, moving from obsession to peace without significant internal contradiction or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal arc—from "fortress" to vulnerability—is clear and resonant, mirroring the external magic. However, interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("sentinel of calm," "warlike serenity") rather than embodied sensation, making the emotional shift feel slightly summarized rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, driving the narrative focus effectively. However, her emotional progression feels slightly linear, moving from anxiety to triumph without a moment of deep internal doubt or cost. The connection with Kael provides necessary friction, but his role is largely functional rather than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris is a compelling protagonist with a clearly defined motivation rooted in guilt and specific backstory. His "reckless idealist" nature drives the plot, leading to the sacrificial choice at the climax. The emotional interiority is strong, though the verbatim repetition of "fiercely gentle" to describe his demeanor feels mechanical and slightly flattens the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's dual nature (roadie/appraiser) is sharply drawn, creating a compelling internal conflict between emotional chaos and factual order. The interiority is generally strong, though the use of the prompt phrase "confidently uncertain" as a direct diagnostic label for his emotional state reads as a minor breach of show-don't-tell ("label-only feelings"). The emotional shift at the end is earned by the flashback and physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s intellectual approach to grief is well-defined, but her emotional interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("agonizing torment," "soaring joy") rather than embodied experience. The transition from sorrow to anticipation feels slightly unearned due to a lack of on-page struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelan’s internal landscape is described with distinct texture ("quiet brass," "gears of thought"), effectively grounding the construct nature. However, the character functions more as a procedural vessel for the tide than an agent making difficult choices; the struggle with "contradictions" is stated in summary rather than dramatized through hesitation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("dissolve the walls") is declared via narration rather than dramatized through prior struggle, making the climax feel slightly unearned. Interiority is present but relies on abstract summaries of emotion ("eulogy for a world") rather than embodied reactions to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and the "un-numbed" physical state adds excellent texture to Elias's interiority. However, his agency falters at the climax; the epiphany is delivered to him by external graffiti rather than emerging from an active choice or internal struggle. This passivity in the pivotal moment weakens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation hinges on an undefined "lie," rendering the stakes abstract and the "desperate" need intellectual rather than visceral. The "confidence man" trait implies deception, yet the resolution reveals simple sincerity, missing a chance for character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a unique sensory profile ("mulberry ache") that grounds his internal state. His conflict between comfort and conscience is palpable, and the choice to defect is earned by the visceral sensory evidence of the vine, moving him credibly from compliance to rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype with no internal life, contradiction, or struggle. Her "sacred duty" is performed without hesitation or cost, resulting in a character who is purely a vehicle for the procedure rather than a protagonist making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is stated rather than felt; the "forgiveness" backstory functions as a mechanical lever for the epiphany rather than a lived emotional reality. The character's internal state relies on diagnostic labels ("worry," "hesitation") rather than embodied reaction, making the transition to action feel scripted.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is a compelling, specific creation ("sincerely insincere"), driving the scene with a clear professional ethos. Kaelen feels slightly more functional, relying on stock cues ("expensive shoes," "tremor") to communicate his state, though his final physical renunciation earns the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivations are clear and drive the interaction, with Elara's backwards-aging condition mirroring the thematic lesson effectively. Kael's impatience provides good friction, though his final realization feels slightly rushed, relying heavily on the visual aid rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelan is consistent and the voice is distinct, but the character is largely reactive. The "historically reverent" trait enforces passivity (waiting) rather than active struggle, and the motivation ("quiet fire") is stated more than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael is a consistent, coherent focalizer with a clear motivation. However, his pivotal epiphany ("The problem wasn't the stone; it was him") feels internalized and abrupt rather than earned through the pressure of the scene, lacking a strong contradictory impulse before the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s internal landscape of grief is rendered with dignity, and the duality of his public role versus private pilgrimage creates effective tension. However, the logistical convenience of a lamplighter possessing high-tech deep-diving gear and using it solo off a pier strains credibility slightly, compressing role and capability for the sake of the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is distinct, and the shift from seeker to curator is earned by the on-page result. Kael's internal state is vivid, though the traits "quietly enthusiastic" and "stellar doubt" rely slightly on labeling over dramatization in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s internal conflict between his duty as a "silent witness" and his need to act on his grief is well-dramatized. The "reaper" identity provides a strong constraint that makes his choice to intervene (crystallize the sound) meaningful. The emotional arc from "hollowed out" to "no longer lost" is earned through the specific action taken.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s "lukewarm" nature serves as an excellent constraint, forcing a tactical solution (rhythm) rather than raw power. However, the protagonist's motivating traits ("brittle devotion," "naivete") are summarized by the narrator rather than demonstrated through difficult micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear role, but his development relies heavily on summary ("spent his evenings," "became the start of a quiet obsession") rather than dramatized interaction. The motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning" is explicitly stated by the narrator rather than emerging organically from his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Character motivation is clear, but the pivotal trait ("secretly sentimental") is delivered via exposition immediately before it is needed, rather than being dramatized or earned earlier. The internal conflict is resolved smoothly, with the protagonist shedding his lifelong worldview without visible struggle or hesitation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but his internal reactions rely on familiar somatic clichés ("settled in his gut like a stone," "heart hammering"). While the connection between the buckle and his composure is functional, the emotional logic feels slightly mechanical rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is legible, but the "phantom limb" of love feels abstract and told rather than viscerally embodied; the transition from absolute numbness relies on dredging up this convenient, nebulous memory without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer whose "receptive" nature drives the plot, but he lacks internal friction or genuine struggle. He accepts a decade-long burden with idealized calm, solving the central mystery without the hesitation or doubt that would deepen psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's specific emotional constraint—"mournfully eager"—is beautifully dramatized through the physical struggle with the pull cord, grounding spectral yearning in tactile effort. His motivation is distinct and drives the beat, though the title "leaf blower symphony conductor" feels slightly imposed rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyel’s internal conflict—feral duty versus profound nostalgia—is palpable and drives the narrative arc. The decision to reject the portal is earned through his established identity as a guardian who has "interiorized" the cold, transforming a potential trope into a specific character moment. The "feral" traits are integrated well with his intellectual longing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear, but character traits are often "told" via adjectives ("stoic resignation," "frantic sensitivity") rather than embodied in action. The emotional pivot relies on internal summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and competently drives her technical choices, but the transition from "familiar despair" to "defiant practicality" relies on a sudden flashback rather than embodied struggle. The mentor's advice acts as a convenient scaffold for the pivot, bypassing a deeper exploration of her internal conflict or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Finn functions as a camera rather than a character; his "resiliently positive" nature is a declared label that conveniently bypasses emotional reaction ("Panic was a luxury") rather than a trait tested by pressure. The epiphany ("sudden, terrifying clarity") grants him total knowledge without deductive struggle, and he faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear obsession, and his adaptation to the shifting memory provides a solid internal beat. However, his motivation is delivered through exposition ("His motivation was singular") rather than dramatized desire, distancing the reader from the stakes until the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kaelen acts as a competent vehicle for the concept but lacks internal friction or visceral cost; his "obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through destructive trade-offs. The absence of an on-page antagonist allows him to succeed without forcing a difficult character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is defined primarily by occupational labels ("technician of sorrow," "specialist in the cartography of loss") rather than embodied struggle. The secondary character, Leo, lacks resistance; his immediate acceptance of a stranger's supernatural message feels like "perfect emotional calibration" rather than a genuine human reaction, reducing the scene's friction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the sudden manifestation of the phase-shifting ability undermines his established limitations (claustrophobia). The character reads more as a vessel for the prompt's required mechanics than a fully realized individual with consistent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with contradictory desires; her primary trait is a biographical fact (the error) rather than an active drive. Her motivation ("fetch wisdom") is abstract, and her internal state lacks the friction of competing impulses needed to generate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is stated clearly in diagnostic interiority ("My purpose, my quiet obsession"), but the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Kaelen functions as a ritual performer rather than a conflicted protagonist; he faces no difficult choices or doubts, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's shift from vengeance to protection relies on a rapid epiphany ("suddenly felt profoundly... stupid") triggered by observation rather than a pressure-tested struggle. The conflicting statements of intent—exposing the monster versus the later claim of wanting a "cosmic joke"—create a dissonance in character logic that weakens the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks specific interiority or contradiction; her "quiet ache" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The lack of significant flaws or a moment of hesitation makes her agency feel mechanical, serving the magic system rather than driving the narrative through character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is stated clearly and the professional competence is convincing, but the character lacks internal contradiction or a difficult choice in the moment; he executes a plan perfectly without wavering.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, atmospheric presence, and his internal state is legible. However, his motivation is delivered largely through diagnostic interiority ("He believed this was the purpose of his hands") rather than dramatized struggle. The climax relies on a surge of external "grace" rather than a hard, active choice between conflicting desires, reducing his agency in the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent figure, but he functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under pressure. His motivation ("to find the place") is clear, yet the absence of internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a "felt cost" to his choices leaves him static. The emotional arc is mild—contentment to anticipation to satisfaction—lacking the volatility or depth required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.0)
    Silas lacks internal contradiction; he functions purely as an agent of his obsession without psychological resistance or conflicting desires. The emotional landscape is stated through abstract labels ("aching void") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or behavior that diverges from his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is a static archetype who performs a ritual with perfect competence, lacking internal conflict or doubt. There is no personal cost or trade-off to his actions; he functions as a plot device rather than a character undergoing a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation is singular and clear, grounding the narrative effectively. However, the pivotal shift from thirty years of discipline to impulsive action relies on a declared "hour when habits break" rather than accumulating immediate pressure, making the decision feel slightly convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael is a compelling, distinct figure; his "walking backwards" is a brilliant physicalization of trauma that grounds his character. Elara’s growth from flinching student to resolved agent is earned quickly but credibly through the tea ritual. The mentor-student dynamic avoids clichés by focusing on the shared cost of exile rather than just instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elian functions as a generic archetype rather than a distinct individual; his "insatiable creativity" is stated as a label to justify the magic system rather than dramatized through struggle or failure. Interiority remains abstract, focusing on the mechanics of the ritual rather than embodied human emotion or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Character motivations are clear and the master-apprentice dynamic is functional, though heavily reliant on genre archetypes. Interiority tends toward metaphorical abstraction ("fragile dam against the tide") rather than embodied visceral experience, distancing the reader slightly from the fear and exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("methodical curiosity," "shielded openness") rather than embodied action or struggle. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or conflicting desires; her path is a straight line of competent investigation without emotional risk or personal cost. The moment of connection ("tremor of connection") is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a high-stakes dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s "quietly analytic" nature is well-established, but their emotional arc relies on summary ("griefs felt lighter") rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. The relationship with Mortimer adds slight texture, but the protagonist functions more as a passive observer than an active agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian is functionally motivated by his desire to comfort Lyra, but his interiority relies on abstract labels ("loneliness," "unspoken needs") rather than embodied complexity. He lacks distinct flaws or internal friction, operating primarily as a competent vehicle for the prompt's technical process.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is a consistent focalizer with a clear objective that drives the scene. His transition from inquisitive servant to keeper of the secret feels earned, though the "affectionate detachment" at the closure reads slightly as a label rather than a fully dramatized emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a distinct, compelling focalizer whose professional background seamlessly colors his worldview ("fear was a low-altitude emotion"). His motivation is clear and deeply felt, driving the narrative through a specific, idiosyncratic project rather than generic survival beats. The transition from castaway to curator feels earned through his internal processing of the memories, grounded in his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s face blindness is brilliantly integrated, transforming a disability into the specific tactile strength required to solve the story’s central puzzle. Her internal state is vividly rendered through texture and pattern rather than visual features, creating a distinct and consistent psychological landscape. The motivation—duty to a dying master and the desire to create sanctuary—drives her agency effectively against the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype with clear but stated motivation ("deep-seated need"); his internal life relies on diagnostic labels ("frustration," "awe") rather than embodied complexity. The "sociable isolation" trait is told but not dramatized in a way that generates friction or contradictory impulses. The character serves the puzzle rather than the puzzle testing the character's depths.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is consistent and her competence is established, but her interiority is somewhat static. She functions more as a vessel for the prophecy than an agent making difficult choices under pressure; the lack of hesitation when sacrificing the guarded essence dampens the character drama.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characters function as archetypes—the believer, the skeptic, the doer—without internal contradiction or deepening. The "strangers to family" dynamic is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through friction or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer, but his motivation acts as a static premise rather than a source of struggle. His internal state is conveyed through abstract labels ("bruised awe," "impossible arrogance") rather than embodied reaction or conflicted micro-choices. He executes a ritual without hesitation, reducing agency to a single linear track.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, weary protagonist with a clear motivation ("stubborn spark") that drives the scene. His transition from resignation to action is effective, though the sudden introduction of telekinetic ability ("wrestling with an unseen force") feels slightly under-explained as a capability, lacking physical toll beyond a furrowed brow.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's professional filter (polymer chemistry) effectively shapes his interiority and perception of the ravine. However, the emotional pivot feels psychologically convenient; the transition from years of rigid grief to acceptance via a single nature metaphor lacks the friction of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian serves primarily as a philosophical vessel rather than a psychological agent. His "profound dissatisfaction" is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through friction or cost. The prompt attribute "mindfully scattered" is inserted as an adverbial label for his thoughts, feeling like an external instruction rather than an organic trait.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s internal landscape is distinct, and his arc from brittle avoidance to sturdy acceptance is clear and earned by the climax. However, the core motivation is delivered via exposition ("His motivation was simple...") rather than dramatized through a difficult early choice, and the "anvil" metaphor for his empathy feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a functional vehicle for the prompt elements rather than a fully realized character. He lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his competence is absolute, and his emotional state is described via external cues ("sweat beading") rather than embodied experience. The trait "empathetically decisive" is pasted on as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is distinct and compelling, driving the narrative clearly. Her "helix-minded" nature is effectively dramatized as a tool for survival in the climax ("kept her sane"), though the risk of "self-dissolution" feels slightly more stated than viscerally embodied in the moment of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but his "prism-mind" functions more as a superpower that dissolves obstacles than a trait generating internal conflict. The panic in the climax is resolved too cleanly by this competence, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or difficult choice. The emotional landscape is serviceable but lacks contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the magic system but lacks internal contradiction or a "crucible" moment. She faces no difficult choices or meaningful resistance, resulting in a performance rather than a dramatic arc with earned character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on emotional labels ("mournful," "awe," "hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied experience. The climax leans on melodrama ("tear traced a path") rather than earned emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias creates a distinct presence through his renunciation at the end, choosing privacy over information, which creates earned character depth. However, the "eclectic pacifist" trait feels like an aesthetic label regarding noise rather than a deep moral framework driving choices, and his motivation to "catalog silence" borders on abstract whimsy until grounded by the grandmother connection.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal struggle is well-embodied through the sensory details of her trade. The shift from panic to "quiet partnership" is earned through the on-page meditation, though the transition feels slightly rapid for the intensity of the "riot of smells." Her motivation anchors the narrative firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her "desperate need" is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The lack of internal conflict or a distinct, flawed personality results in a generic "intrepid pilot" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clearly stated ("quest to cultivate foresight") but functions more as a prompt label than a source of visceral internal struggle. While his methodical nature is consistent, the final realization feels like a data download rather than an earned insight derived from character-specific intuition or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kael functions as a narrative device rather than a character; he lacks interiority, contradiction, or doubt. He performs the ritual with perfect competence and faces no difficult choices, resulting in a flat protagonist who pays no emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, with strong interiority anchoring his grief. However, the emotional progression relies on diagnostic summary ("mechanics of his own breaking") and abstract labeling ("immense and sorrowful curiosity") rather than fully embodied struggle. The epiphany feels slightly cerebral, explained to the reader rather than viscerally experienced through action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent protagonist driven by a clear intellectual want ("mathematics of emotion"). His "borrowing" trait adds texture, though he functions more as an archetypal observer than a character forced into deep internal conflict. Anya serves effectively as the subject, validating his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is passive, acting as a camera for the magical event rather than driving the narrative through choice. The internal arc resolves via summary ("The jittery courier was gone, replaced by a man who finally understood") rather than earned struggle or decision. The anxiety is established but cured instantly by the spectacle without psychological cost or gradual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between mystic idealism and scientific rigor is masterfully dramatized. The final renunciation of his "beautiful lie" is a profound, earned character beat that forecloses his previous worldview with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the pivotal crisis—faltering the night before—is summarized rather than dramatized, distancing the reader from the struggle. Emotional states are often labeled with adjectives ("wistful ache," "hollow") rather than embodied in complex, specific behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s internal landscape is rendered with precision; the "hollowed out" feeling upon losing the memory of the plum is a masterclass in embodied cost. The contrast between his "gentle hands" and the weight of his task creates a compelling, consistent character dynamic. Motivation is clear and drives every on-page choice, culminating in a poignant sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s role as a sensory map maker is thoroughly integrated into his interiority and problem-solving, grounding abstract sci-fi concepts in concrete perception. His motivation is clear and poignant, driving the transition from passive observer to active agent effectively. The resignation in his final choice—paying a debt to a ghost—adds necessary emotional weight to the technical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a consistent, grounded protagonist with a clear internal landscape. However, his motivation is delivered via exposition ("His motivation wasn't heroism but a desperate need...") rather than emerging solely through action, and the "fragile intimacy" is summarized rather than dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelan reads as a stock "mad artist" archetype defined by performative behaviors ("manic grin," "gale" of laughter) rather than internal depth. He faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices, functioning solely as a mechanical operator of the lighthouse routine.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation is legible, but the "donor heart" trope leans heavily on the cliché of cellular memory driving character agency ("urging me to look closer"). While the interiority is consistent, the emotional cost is low; the protagonist observes rather than risking something significant, and the connection to the woman relies on a convenient link to the donor rather than an earned relational turn.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris is a competent focalizer with a clear obsession, but he lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. His actions are procedurally perfect and he faces no significant obstacle or difficult choice that tests his character, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where competence replaces struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a character with conflicting desires. Her internal state is described as "shattered," yet she acts with unwavering competence and focus, lacking the blind spots or struggle required for depth. The resolution offers total healing without a dramatized personal cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("compassionate recluse," "genuine loneliness") rather than embodied emotion. The central epiphany—resolving a life paradox simply by watching someone—feels unearned and lacks a stress-tested choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is sharply drawn, contrasting the "private sin" of hoarding with the generative act of gardening. Elara's internal landscape is specific and contradictory, and the patrolman's shift, while rapid, is earned through the shared, specific totem of the bread.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.3)
    Kaelen functions primarily as a procedural vessel for the premise rather than a distinct individual; his motivation ("penance") is asserted rather than dramatized through behavior. The internal landscape is summarized with abstract labels ("sorrowful purpose") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses or difficult micro-choices. While competent, the character lacks the specific, irrational humanity required to elevate the piece beyond a functional archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a proactive protagonist who drives the action through a clear hierarchy of tactics. However, the explicit insertion of the phrase "her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through" disrupts her interiority, reading as a mechanical checklist item rather than an organic character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is a distinct, well-rendered focalizer with a specific intellectual worldview ("luminous skeptic"). However, her role is primarily observational; she witnesses the climax rather than precipitating it through decision or risk. The internal shift at the end feels summarized ("finally understood") rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a well-drawn focalizer with a specific constraint (eidetic memory) that functions as both gift and curse. The internal conflict between commercial success and artistic bankruptcy is clear, though the shift from grief to resolution feels slightly rapid for the stakes established.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian is a consistent, clear protagonist with a specific yearning, but his internal arc is largely static until the final epiphany. The transition from calligrapher to cultivator feels more like a role swap than a deeply felt psychological cost or transformation born of struggle. The obsession with "lost conversations" serves the plot well but feels slightly disconnected from the "truth" theme until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elian is a competent archetype rather than a nuanced character, facing no internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices under pressure. His motivation is stated ("quiet, burning thing") rather than dramatized through struggle, and he functions merely as the successful executor of a plan. The "seasonal muteness" is framed as an asset rather than a constraint, removing potential friction or cost from his character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal voice is distinct, blending technical constraints with organic emotion effectively. However, the resolution relies on a convenient capability upgrade ("programming rewriting itself on the fly") rather than a hard choice within established limits, weakening the character's agency at the climax. The connection to Elara is poignant but relies heavily on told nostalgia rather than dramatized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction, functioning as a flawless moral agent who resolves the conflict without personal cost or struggle. His motivation ("mend a tear") is stated via diagnostic labeling rather than dramatized through difficult choices or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is a distinct protagonist with a clear motivation, though the internal struggle resolves somewhat too easily. The shift from frustration to "new understanding" lacks the friction of a deeply felt resistance, making the emotional cost of surrendering logic feel lighter than the stakes imply.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but he lacks internal dynamism. He faces no difficult choice or contradiction; he simply performs a ritual and succeeds. The emotional arc is linear—grief to validation—without the "crucible" of a decision that carries visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist serves as an archetype of competence rather than a character under pressure; she experiences no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses. Her motivation is abstract, and she executes her task without emotional cost or personal transformation, resulting in a static, functional presence rather than a dramatic one.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clara is a functional focalizer, but her obsession is stated rather than emotionally grounded in a specific deficit or need. The shift from "agreed upon lies" to an interrogation feels like a plot requirement rather than an organic emotional break; the internal cost of breaking the sanctuary is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian's motivation is clear, but his transition from "charmed skeptic" to full believer is rushed, resolving via the abstract label "longing" rather than a dramatized struggle. Interiority relies heavily on "telling" metaphors ("hollow space," "void") rather than embodied emotion, making the transformation feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen is a competent focalizer with clear motivation ("forgive the unfinished"), but his internal state is largely delivered via summary ("His motivation was not gold...") rather than dramatized desire. The struggle is physical execution rather than a difficult choice made under pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on explicit labeling ("Her attribute... was both a gift and a curse") rather than demonstrated traits. Motivation is stated in exposition but lacks dramatized struggle; Lyra faces no genuine internal contradiction or difficult choice, merely performing the required steps to solve the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a character in a crucible; she lacks the internal contradiction or personal stakes required for high-band scoring. Her motivation is stated ("to salvage something pure") but never tested by a difficult choice, resulting in a static emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen functions well as a focalizer for the theme, and the link between his trade and his philosophy is effectively drawn. However, he lacks internal friction or contradiction; his appreciation is too perfect, and the "demure audacity" feels stated rather than a source of genuine struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen is a competent focalizer with a clear drive ("excavate truth"), but the characterization relies on professional capacity rather than internal conflict or vulnerability. There are no contradictory impulses or "crucible" moments where the protagonist must choose between competing values; the journey is a straight line of problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elian's motivation is clearly stated, and his isolation is felt, but his agency collapses at the climax. He becomes a passive recipient of the solution when the storm conveniently jars the chest open for him, rather than solving the lock through skill or sacrifice. The shift from observer to "Cobalt Prophet" is summarized rather than dramatized, distancing the reader from his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a coherent fable archetype with clear motivation ("translator between generations"), but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The "positively wistful ache" functions as a label rather than embodied emotion, and his journey meets no resistance or cost, resulting in a low-pressure narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but her key trait ("logically emotional") is diagnosed via internal exposition rather than dramatized through a complex dilemma. The internal conflict remains largely physical (body vs. mind) rather than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s internal conflict is described through metaphors ("wild animal") rather than demonstrated via a difficult on-page choice. She executes a pre-calculated plan without facing a moment of doubt or trade-off that would test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct professional focalizer whose internal conflict—empirical rationalism versus a sudden intuitive experience—drives the narrative. The defiance of his boss is earned through the specific parallel with the lantern's history, grounding the final choice in character rather than plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Arthur’s internal guilt and "calm before realization" provide a clear, empathetic baseline, but his interaction with Elias lacks friction; Elias functions primarily as a "magical craftsman" archetype who dispenses the thematic lesson, which Arthur accepts somewhat passively.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen acts with high agency, driving the plot through risk and intellect. While his motivation is strong and interiority is distinct, his opening monologue ("beautiful disaster") leans into performative cliché, slightly undermining the otherwise grounded characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, though her defining trait ("brightly attentive") is asserted rather than dramatized in the pivotal moment of discovery. The internal friction during the confrontation with Kael—viewing the lie as a "betrayal of the truth"—adds welcome depth to a brief scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael functions as a plot device rather than a fully realized protagonist; he faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or personal cost while resolving the dispute. The secondary characters are archetypes of "anger" and "silence" who exist solely to be managed, lacking independent agency or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "euthanasia tourist" premise creates a compelling, detached focalizer, but Elara remains largely passive, observing rather than struggling against her constraints. The backstory of "waking up changed" feels like a convenient label for her state rather than a dramatized psychological reality. Her internal landscape is rich, but the lack of active friction with the other volunteers or the work itself limits character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions as a credible vessel for the metaphor until the internal monologue breaks character. The sudden use of academic jargon ("intersubjective understanding") shatters the specific, earthy persona built around "fermented earth" and calloused hands, reading as authorial intrusion rather than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but he lacks deep internal contradiction or emotional texture beyond the immediate task. The "half-masked" trait is physical but doesn't constrain his choices or interactions significantly in the scene. The "strange honesty" is asserted rather than fully dramatized through costly choices beyond the initial exit.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias functions as a magical archetype rather than a character; he faces no internal contradiction, difficult choice, or personal cost. His motivation is stated via exposition ("to transmute pain into a masterpiece") rather than dramatized through struggle, resulting in a flat, purely functional protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, evocative figure ("folded into the shape of a question mark"), and his shift from active curator to passive oracle is character-specific. However, the internal evolution relies on a summarized montage ("For weeks, he did nothing but listen"), distancing the reader from the specific emotional struggle that prompts the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas is a compelling focalizer; the specific constraint of "precognitive forgetting" creates a unique, dramatized struggle that feels authentic rather than gimmicky. His internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from desperate possession to acceptance is earned through the loss of the sigil. The emotional cost is palpable in the moment of improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a compelling protagonist whose professional competence and personal grief are perfectly braided. The decision to sacrifice the lens—his tool for capturing the ephemeral—to permanently anchor the moment is a profound, character-driven choice with visible emotional cost. The internal motivation ("luminous ache") directly fuels the external resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara functions efficiently as an agent of the plot, but her lack of internal conflict or flaws makes her feel more like a narrative device than a person. The ease with which she overcomes Lena’s decade of "accumulated pain" reduces the daughter to a prop for the protagonist's competence. The emotional landscape is smooth and idealized, lacking the friction of genuine character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara is a functional, competent protagonist whose motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful personal stakes. Her &quot;quiet deliberation&quot; serves the plot well but does not force a difficult choice or sacrifice; she solves the puzzle without facing genuine risk or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary; Elias’s profession as a bone setter provides a distinct, tangible framework for his internal conflict (rationality vs. fracture). The shift from skeptic to believer is earned through physical action and specific memory, with the cost of his worldview legible on the page. The yearning for his wife's faith is embodied, avoiding generic grief.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a complex character, fitting the fable-like tone but limiting depth. Her motivation is clear ("share light without fire"), but the internal conflict is resolved smoothly by memory rather than difficult on-page choices. The emotional arc is linear—from untethered to purposeful—without the friction of contradictory impulses or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich, but the "watchful dreamer" trait relies on authorial labeling ("by nature") rather than pure dramatization. Kaelen’s shift at the end is earned by the gesture, but his passivity for the majority of the text limits the dynamic tension until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist relies on the "tortured writer" archetype, with emotions labeled ("despair," "reverence") rather than embodied through unique action. The shift from cynic to "keeper" feels unearned by the brief struggle, relying on a ritualistic gesture rather than a complex internal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elian functions as a procedural operator rather than a character under pressure; he faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. The lack of distinct interiority or flaws reduces him to a generic archetype (the wise restorer). His success is never in doubt, and he pays no personal price for the ritual's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kaelen is a consistent, competent archetype who executes a ritual with expertise, but he lacks the internal conflict or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. While his physical endurance serves as characterization, his singular focus prevents the layering of competing wants or flaws; he functions more as a vessel for the procedure than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elian is a consistent, competent focalizer, but he lacks internal contradiction or struggle. His motivation is stated as a philosophical axiom rather than a visceral drive, and his "peripheral focus" functions more as a convenient tool than a complicated trait. He solves the problem without facing a dilemma or paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen is a consistent, functional protagonist with a clear role, but he lacks internal dynamism in this specific window. He functions as a magical processor of grief without distinct, contradictory impulses or a moment of vulnerability that tests his resolve. The characterization is competent but static, serving the ritual rather than driving a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and the link between her past role and present craft drives the scene, but the interiority leans heavily on diagnostic summary ("too grand and too simple") rather than embodied experience. The characterization is coherent, but the emotional logic is often told to the reader before it is shown in action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clearly established, and the internal conflict between his ambition and regret drives the narrative. However, the ghost functions more as a static sounding board than a dynamic pressure; the integration at the end feels slightly rushed, with the ghost capitulating immediately ("The ghost did not argue") rather than forcing a harder, more costly final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is competent and active, but her primary motivation ("puzzling out new equations for hope") feels abstract and thematic rather than visceral. While her actions are consistent, the lack of internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs keeps the characterization functional rather than deep.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is stated via exposition ("The motivation... was simple") rather than dramatized through hesitation or conflicting impulses in the scene. The emotional resolution feels asserted in summary rather than earned by the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and successfully anchors the scene, driving the physical action. However, his competence relies on a semi-magical sensory ability ("hummed with a low, insistent vibration") rather than earned skill, distancing the reader from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with a unique vocation, but he operates as a functional archetype rather than a conflicted character. His "infinite patience" removes the potential for internal struggle or cost, resulting in a static emotional arc where success feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an observer rather than an agent; he watches a magical projection and records it without facing resistance or making a difficult choice. His primary action is internal and facilitated by a convenient supernatural ability, lacking the "crucible" of pressure or contradiction required for high-stakes characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clearly stated, but his obsession is summarized rather than dramatized through high-pressure micro-choices. The narrative tells us of his "ache" and "reverie" rather than showing the specific, jagged friction of his struggle in the moment. The emotional arc resolves a bit too neatly into acceptance without a moment of resistance or active grappling with the flawed result.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her internal state is often conveyed through diagnostic labels ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert") rather than embodied reaction. The "daughter of an arsonist" trait feels like backstory summary until the coin moment, where it finally drives a specific, meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a procedural vehicle rather than a conflicted protagonist; her skepticism is stated in exposition but does not complicate her actions in the scene. The "imaginative" attribute is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or tactic. There is no on-page cost to her decision, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Xylar’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative from the opening line. The internal shift from "searching" to "emitting" is a well-earned psychological turn rooted in the character's specific "sentimentalist" nature. While the interiority occasionally leans into abstract labeling ("feelings too vast for a heart"), the emotional logic holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is stated as a "singular obsession" rather than dramatized through conflicting desires, and agency dissolves at the climax where a "force" directs his hand. The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through abstract labels ("thundering in his soul") rather than embodied contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is stated rather than dramatized ("motivation was not memory, but to restore shared balance"); the internal conflict is summarized via diagnostic labeling ("ethically diligent nature screamed") rather than shown through a difficult, cost-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is defined by declared obsession rather than demonstrated need; "blithe" in the opening contradicts the "surgeon's focus" and heavy obsession shown later without an earned transition. Interiority relies on summary ("frantic hope," "crushing weight") rather than embodied emotion. The character performs the plot mechanically without facing a dilemma or paying a personal price for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and the internal pressure is legible, but the character reads more as an archetype of duty than a specific individual with contradictory impulses. The internal conflict is resolved through reflection rather than a difficult trade-off between conflicting personal needs, making the emotional arc feel slightly intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a focused, consistent protagonist with clear motivation (preservation), but the scene lacks a testing moment where his values are forced into conflict. He performs a ritualistic task with high competence and no on-page struggle or hesitation, which flattens the character arc into a functional role rather than a lived experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara functions more as a thematic delivery system than a character under pressure; her internal conflict is summarized in the final paragraph rather than dramatized through a difficult choice in the scene. Kael is compliant, reducing the interaction to a smooth transaction without interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas is consistent and the final resignation (Earned Stasis) is credible, but the opening relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("philosophy one of stark, material truth") to establish traits rather than dramatizing them. The "rational refusal" and "carefully constructed logic" are told via summary, distancing the reader from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a clearly defined protagonist with legible interiority, but the shift from resignation to &quot;purely expectant&quot; feels unearned by the brief on-page struggle. The choir functions as a monolithic prop rather than a dynamic counter-force; their generations of hatred dissolve too easily without genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear, but Elias lacks internal contradiction or struggle; he executes his task with perfect competence. The "informal wisdom" trait acts as a label rather than a demonstrated constraint, and diagnostic interiority ("physical manifestation of a society’s traumatic decline") distances the reader from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas’s motivation (“to preserve wonder”) is explicitly stated in narration rather than dramatized through struggle or subtext. The head-hop into Lena’s interiority (“She finally understood...”) violates the established single POV, disrupting character consistency. The compulsion to be truthful is mentioned but easily circumvented by the riddle, reducing its pressure as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a consistent, coherent worldview that drives the narrative. However, her internal journey lacks sufficient friction; the "inadvertently profound" epiphany arrives without genuine struggle or contradiction, feeling more like a convenient realization than an earned psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's internal transition from righteous crusader to protector is earned through specific, embodied interaction with Galen and the environment. The conflicting impulses (duty vs. truth) are dramatized clearly, and the final renunciation carries the visible cost of abandoning her people's narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation is distinct and esoteric, driving the narrative arc from prisoner to artist effectively. The internal worldview ("flaw in every perfection") creates a coherent engine for his persistence, though the emotional climax relies slightly on summarized label-speak ("agonizingly perfect," "pure and powerful") rather than dramatized, contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's insomnia functions as a magical trait without physiological cost, reducing him to a romanticized archetype rather than a grounded character. The lack of struggle or contradiction in his "saintly" drive limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.3)
    Alistair functions as a competent vehicle for the plot, but his internal landscape feels sketched rather than inhabited. The shift from "curating memories" to "sonic engineer" relies on the convenient label of his "historically oriented mind" rather than a deep, dramatized trait or struggle. He lacks the internal contradiction or messy humanity required for higher bands; his doubt is stated ("despair settled") rather than felt through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a consistent, archetypal figure whose motivation ("step beyond fate's design") drives the narrative clearly. However, the emotional stakes remain abstract and philosophical until the final lines; a specific, grounded memory or loss would have sharpened the "tremor in his soul" and made the cost more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation (trick Fear) and internal conflict (the void/curse) are clear and drive the narrative. The protagonist is somewhat reactive to the advisor's instructions until the climax, where the decision to "unbosom" the void demonstrates agency. The "void" transitions effectively from a source of shame to a weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kai is a competent, idealized figure who faces the storm with professional expertise rather than internal conflict. While his actions are clear, he lacks a "crucible" moment where he must choose between conflicting values or endure a cost deeper than physical exertion. The narrative functions as a demonstration of skill rather than a character study under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen is a clearly defined focalizer with a consistent internal drive. However, the transition from "quietly driven" to "obsession" relies on summary ("hardening into obsession") rather than dramatized micro-choices in the middle section. The emotional weight is often labeled ("dread was a physical thing") rather than embodied through reaction to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara’s capitulation—abandoning a century-long legacy after a single historical analogy—feels unearned and lacks genuine internal struggle. Aris functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized character, with traits diagnosed by the narrator rather than shown through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    Character motivation is clear and the dichotomy between the "man of straight lines" and his romantic interiority drives the action. However, the interiority relies heavily on expository labels ("kinship with that particular form of loss," "currents of feeling") rather than dramatized contradiction in the early beats. The "stoic guarding" persona feels slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is precise and deeply integrated with the plot; Elias’s "tranquilly perceptive" nature drives the choice to investigate rather than panic. The internal conflict—official history vs. observed truth—is embodied in his specific actions, and the resolution (a quiet, solitary commitment to correction) perfectly fits his established personality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clearly defined and drives the narrative arc from paralysis to action. His internal state is rendered with consistency, though the emotional transformation at the climax feels slightly rapid and relies on abstract summary ("grief was no longer a drowning sea but a current") rather than a dramatized micro-choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Amal’s motivation is fierce and clearly defined, driving the narrative from the first line. However, her interiority occasionally leans into melodramatic abstraction ("needle in her soul") rather than grounded emotional reaction, making her feel slightly more like a vessel for the concept than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist acts as a functional operator for the plot device rather than a character with embodied desires or contradictions. The motivation ("decode the frequency of belonging") is abstract label-speak that is stated rather than dramatized through specific lack or need. There is no internal conflict or difficult choice; she simply follows instructions to a guaranteed success.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias has a compelling arc, shifting from a merchant of lies to a restorer of truth, a renunciation that feels earned. However, his interiority relies on melodramatic summary (e.g., "curse etched into his soul") rather than grounded, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from his immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a coherent protagonist, anchored well by the brass object, but his interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("uncommonly thoughtful") rather than dramatized complexity. The internal conflict is stated ("recycle mistakes into wisdom") rather than felt through contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.0)
    Interiority is flattened by diagnostic labeling; stating "His core motivation... was to align heart and action" substitutes summary for dramatized desire. While the "one degree of error" backstory provides a solid anchor, the character's present state relies too heavily on explicit emotional telling ("faith... was now a flickering candle") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist's internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("ghost of awe," "jaded wonder," "detachment") rather than embodied experience. The emotional pivot at the climax is asserted ("a feeling pierced the grey numbness") rather than earned through dramatized struggle, making the transformation feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motivation is singular and potent, driving him through a clear internal conflict—the desire for connection versus the horror of self-erasure. The moment of resistance ("He wanted her, not to become her") grounds the emotional stakes effectively. The surrender feels earned by the prior setup of the fortune's mandate, resulting in a distinct, character-specific transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—the cartomancer who cannot map her own present—is poignant and clearly defined. However, the resolution relies on a rapid, summarized internal shift ("a profound calm replaced the anxiety") rather than a decision forced by escalating pressure. The emotional pivot feels therapeutic and tidy rather than earned through a dramatized struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is singular and drives the ritual, but Elara functions more as an archetypal vessel than a complex protagonist. Her interiority relies on abstract states ("unconditional peace," "profound...lightness") rather than the messy, contradictory impulses of a high-band character, though the gravitational attribute successfully grounds her emotions in physics.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael functions as a vessel for the prompt’s philosophical conceit rather than a living character; his motivation ("to truly understand the texture of transformation") is abstract and asserted rather than felt. There are no contradictory impulses or internal conflicts; he acts purely on whimsical benevolence, and the world rewards him without exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael is a competent focalizer with a clear objective and motivation (revolution), but he functions more as a perfect agent than a character under pressure. While his physical reactions ("knuckles white," "tremor") ground him, he faces no difficult dilemma or trade-off; his plan executes without a hitch, bypassing the opportunity for character-revealing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s interiority and agency are distinct, and his motivation to protect the bluff is clear. However, the "eel herder" persona feels like an aesthetic label; he ignores the eels during the crisis, and their presence does not functionally shape his decisions or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear backstory, but his internal state is summarized via labels ("furiously tranquil") rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. The emotional shift from tranquility to fury at the timer's mechanical signal feels abrupt and dictated by plot necessity rather than psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kaelen is defined by hyper-competence and philosophical resolve, but lacks internal friction or vulnerability. He functions as a flawless problem-solving device rather than a character under pressure; his success is inevitable, and the absence of doubt or emotional cost limits the depth of the inciting challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas is a distinct, voice-driven protagonist, but his primary trait (the persona shift) functions as a static filter rather than a source of active conflict in the scene. The climax—welcoming the strangers—lacks internal friction; because the "Architect" sees only potential, the decision feels automatic rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian is defined by his role and longing, but lacks internal contradiction; his choice is a forced survival move rather than a dilemma, reducing character agency's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to protect the memory is clear and drives the narrative. However, the internal pivot from "methodical mind" to "channel" feels slightly unearned by on-page struggle; the realization arrives as a sudden epiphany rather than a hard-won consequence of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kenji functions more as a vessel for the prompt's metaphors than a fully realized agent; his primary action is obedience to posthumous instructions rather than making a difficult choice. The emotional arc relies on a magical object to "diffuse" his guilt, bypassing the necessary internal struggle or dramatized cost of processing grief. While the bonsai tutor persona is established, his interiority remains abstract and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is scientist-cold yet grief-raw; the contradiction is embodied in his obsessive staring through the dust-pane. His micro-choice to wipe a clear circle is the visible hinge where detachment cracks and humility is admitted. Cost is present: the “chaos of unfiltered reality” he now agrees to join. Yet the shift is compressed into a single soft gesture; a harder-earned renunciation would lift this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fear of fire, her tactile study of frost, her final deliberate kiln re-lighting—all trace a credible arc from shattered artist to deliberate witness. The contradiction between her former creative fire and new ice-reading calm is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Final choice to encase the ledger in glass carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by every tremor at the kiln. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are NA; single-POV rules met.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, tactile, and specific—her bare feet on chilled flagstones, the silver circlet’s pulse, the violet thread she clings to. The trauma flash is embodied (orange terror, indigo deep) rather than labeled. Her final act of weaving colors into sunrise/calm sea feels earned because the circlet’s mechanics and her daily ritual were seeded early. Only quibble: the “profound peace” tag is slightly abstract at the close, dulling the cost edge.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s bone-deep fatigue and psychic burden are rendered through crisp, embodied detail (“weariness etched deeper than the lines on his face”), and his stubbornness drives the single decisive action of fitting the lens. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final quiet feels earned because we watched him pay with each impossible fold of space. The absence of on-page relationships or secondary pressure keeps this just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s hunger-driven persistence and the embodied bell-ringing renunciation land with cost; interiority stays concrete (“let its pure tone ring out once”). The shift from anonymous terror to communal garden is earned, though the elders’ “rusty gates” memory beat edges toward label-speak. All micro-choices feed the stake; no competence over-balances struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative but drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“the ache in her chest eased…”) rather than dramatized contradiction; the breathing method is shown twice yet never truly complicates her stance under pressure, so the “healing” feels announced, not earned. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s monastic obsession with “the texture of time” is viscerally embodied in every micro-choice—digging, aligning the fragment with hedge-angles, the final act of erasure—so motive escalates to annihilation. The memory-fraying is dramatized through physical grasping at leaves that turn static, not declared; interior contradiction peaks when he clings to the very object that devours his past. Amnesia-self at the end is the ultimate Earned Stasis: total forfeiture of identity charged on-page. Hairline slip: “quaking reverie” edges toward diagnostic label-speak twice, blunting embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “patiently strategic” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—reaching for the piano bench, reordering keys, choosing impede over assault—each aligning with her decade-long endurance and tactical remit. Interiority stays concrete (“the cool iron of her chain a familiar comfort”) rather than abstract, and embodied contradiction surfaces in the same beat: she is both captive and orchestrator, calm while the world tears open. The final Earned Stasis—staying chained to buy others time—pays off the established motive and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s demand for earned renunciation with price. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets dormant; head-count is not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interior contradiction—designer of aids for hearing who seeks the sound of betrayal—drives every beat. Synesthesia turns from label to pressure: the violet-grey shard heard at climax is earned by years of catalogued absences. Micro-choice (unsealing each jar) externalizes the hierarchy: containment > comfort. Cost is visible: the crystal’s silence replaces the scream, foreclosing relapse into obsessive collection. No safety-hedging; flaw becomes tool, then scar.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thief’s quietly savvy trait is shown via the florist code system and the calm lunar-chart prep, giving us a credible competence. Interiority is concrete (“a feeling that was part fear and part exhilaration”) and the final renunciation—trading portraits for custodianship of futures—carries visible cost, earning the change. Emotions stay embodied, never drift into label-speak. Flaws are muted: we get little contradictory impulse in-scene and no genuine mistake that compounds, so the arc, while clean, is less a crucible than a serene transfer of vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “perfect, crystalline prison of grief” is embodied, not labeled—but her final pivot from frozen heart to thawed hope leans on a compressed, slightly epiphanic beat rather than a fully dramatized micro-choice; the bookmark triggers memory but does not force a visible tactical shift under pressure, so the renunciation cost is felt more as lyric echo than causal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stuntman’s adaptive core is dramatized in the moment he turns the decrypted failsafe on Julian; trembling-with-certainty is a credible embodied cost. Interiority is sharply particular (“a ghost he had programmed”) and the contradictory impulses—terror of height vs hunger for truth—coexist in the shelf climb. The plaster-cast cipher is a lovely vulnerability-made-tool, but the emotional leap from “phantom limb of a past” to “greatest source of power” is asserted rather than shown through micro-choice, keeping the arc just shy of the 8.5+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—cartographer of an impossible night—drives every micro-choice; the obsession is embodied in the ink-stained finger, the hush-listening posture, the final glyph. The moment the last star winks out crystallizes a credible renunciation: he accepts the cost of eternal witness, foreclosing any ordinary cartographer’s life. No second character, so relationship/status bullets waived; the “mildly obsessed” trait is not label-only but enacted. The 9+ quick test is nearly met: contradictory impulses (map-maker vs. map-the-unmappable) act in scene, and refusal to stop carries felt cost—only the causal linkage to prior beats is hairline shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Unit 734’s composed, analytic interiority is vivid and consistent; the single contradictory impulse—bypassing lethal error warnings—erupts in one decisive micro-choice that breaks the loop and costs its prior certainty. The “G-string” memory injects a human ghost that reweights its machine identity, earning the ending’s stoic solitude. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Meets 9+ test: contradiction in scene + earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet addicted to silent watching—grounds every beat; the lens-box gesture crystallizes his renunciation of further evasion. Lena remains oblique, yet her charcoal-on-stone act makes her grief legible and stakes concrete. Their shared flaw—mutual surveillance instead of speech—compounds until the final offering, earning the thaw. Cost is felt: he abandons a decade of desk-anchored safety, she exposes her coded pain to the very gaze she distrusts.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s stoic pragmatism and quiet defiance are vivid, but the interiority never pierces the mask enough to expose simultaneous contradictions; we see the gesture (polishing the cracked marble) but not the raw split-second where pride and terror coexist. The final act of “adding a single, deliberate crack” is earned, yet the cost is suggested rather than viscerally tasted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s obliging nature is shown through embodied, tool-stained action rather than labels; the moment he registers the adjacent-now, his quiet vertigo is rendered as a “mechanically warm and deeply resonant truth” that costs him the linear comfort he never knew he prized. Interior contradiction is present—steady hands vs. sideways vertigo—without diagnostic self-talk. His micro-choice to release the lever crystallizes a hierarchy of values: duty to Aris < need to feel the universe re-calibrated. The final Earned Stasis is credible: he stays a mechanic but now carries multitudes, cost felt in the “icy air” that feels like a cradle. Aris remains secondary, so relationship-as-crucible not required.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s mania is vivid—cello case “dark, silent companion,” the program handled like a relic—yet his contradictory reverence/desecration of the score stays mostly asserted. Embodied emotion is strong (heart hammering, chill) but interiority slips into diagnostic labels (“strange creative fever”). Final renunciation earns its poise because the earlier obsession is tactile, even if the micro-choice that tips him is more impulse than layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—Elara’s “wide, soft net” perceptual stance is vivid, and the contradiction between needing certainty and needing ambiguity is dramatized through the thumb-smudge beat. The final renunciation (leaving the word blurred) is a credible, costed stance. Minor slip: “fault-tolerant oracle” is asserted twice but never activated—no system crash or bypass is shown—so the trait feels label-only rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The swallowed confession and need to measure guilt give the narrator clear, escalating motive that peaks in the final act of turning the valve. Interiority stays embodied—"gnawing anxiety," "cold dread," "crushing weight"—never sliding into diagnostic talk. Micro-choice (walking into the tunnel, grabbing the wheel) directly externalizes the internal contradiction: he both owns and denies responsibility. The earned exhaustion after closing the valve shows credible, physical cost, completing a clean, individual arc.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific to the keeper’s eroded psyche; the contradictory pull between duty and self-preservation is felt in the trembling hand on the swan. No secondary character appears, so relational crucible is N/A. The final renunciation—suspending purpose beside the star-river—carries visible cost in the acknowledged “temporary” peace, earning Earned Stasis. Minor withhold: the moment the keeper decides to burrow is slightly under-dramatized, a summary glide rather than a micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s grief is rendered through embodied tremor and the tactile curl; Elias’s “quiet hum” and unhurried blanket-adjustment show his mellow therapist identity without label-speak. The final smile is credible because the music and eclipse ritual have visibly re-weighted the curl from despair to tender relic. Interior contradiction is present but soft: Elias’s “cautious exuberance” is named once, not dramatized in action. Still, micro-choice hierarchy is clear—placing the curl to earth is the costly beat that forecloses endless mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s quiet, obsessive need to “listen to walls” is viscerally embodied—he fingers charred paper, breath hitches at the word “wobble.” Yet his interiority never crystallizes into contradictory action: he never considers disobeying the silence, hoarding a surviving diary, or testing the dragons against his own dreaming. The final pose of passive witness is consistent but cost is intellectual, not dramatized; we feel the ache, yet the story forecloses any path that would force him to pay with more than melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “accidentally prophetic” gift and his drive to retune give every beat purpose; embodied emotions (the quiet weight on his chest, the lamp hum) show rather than label. Micro-choices—typing fortunes, packing the bag—trace the arc from conductor to traveler with visible cost. Interior contradiction (control vs. departure) stays active in-scene, not summarized. Only minor lapse: no status pressure from another on-page character, but single-POV design excuses it.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Alistair’s interiority is spare but character-specific (the microphone as tactile anchor, the hum as weapon). His motive to “illuminate hidden assumptions” is stated early and shows up in each rhetorical probe, so the climactic refutation feels earned. The cost—his tired smile, the dropped palette—lands visibly. Elara remains a vessel, but at this length the crucible is the priest-mind, and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s “chronological homesickness” is a vivid, embodied motive; the nautilus shell as tactile lens keeps his interiority concrete. The exhaustion clock gives bodily cost, and the final quiet renunciation—“he could rest”—lands as earned stasis. Minor slip: the shift from cookie hack to cosmic conductor is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the hierarchy of values beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—fighting the memory vs. embracing it—drives every beat; the moment he stops resisting, buoyancy vanishes and the prison dissolves. Embodied emotion is vivid: tablet grit, ozone taste, boot soles finally pressing. The renunciation of flight costs him his literal loft, a price legible on the page. Only nit: the “labyrinth of self” tag is named, not dramatized, slightly abstracting motive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—music teacher who cannot hear, chasing silence that vibrates—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (boots, stylus, stone). Her flaw (numbness) and her tool (broken needle) are inseparable, so the final “intentional silence” is earned. No status dynamics on page, so bullet waived.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s “meteorologist-mind” is palpably embodied—his fingers “accustomed to calibrating sensitive instruments,” his perception filtering every cue through atmospheric physics. The internal contradiction between craving solitude and chasing an intrusive mystery is dramatized in the moment he pockets the parchment: data integrity versus personal exposure. The final choice—to slip underground rather than confront watchers—grows credibly from earlier trait establishment and costs him his safe routine, satisfying earned stasis. Only slight reserve: we never feel a visceral flaw that might complicate his rationality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is precise—his “measured act” of breathing, the vial as tactile anchor—showing embodied contradiction between smell-avoidance and scent-seeking. Grief is revealed through sensory micro-choices (sliding the vial under UV, inhaling at the end) rather than labels, earning the final tears. Motive remains stable: understand the ghost-scent → recover Elara → accept loss. Closure cost is visible: the breath he once rationed becomes the breath that accepts her absence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic—his “wry smile” under cosmic interrogation, the rope memory as tactile trigger. Contradictory impulses (cling to singular self vs dissolve into eternity) coexist in-scene, culminating in a credibly costly renunciation. The ethically playful trait shows in his library/burned-books quip and refusal to pick a side, both moments altering the Lumin’s stance. No diagnostic self-labeling; the cost is atmospheric yet felt when the light diffuses into his air, leaving him alone with the burden of double vision.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to “unbind” sound yet terrified of rupturing the hush—drives every micro-choice; her arms aching and heart “full, not with noise, but with completion” embodies cost without therapy-speak. The inherited bowl and ship-mast violin act as embodied heirlooms that tighten stakes; her final renunciation (playing into absorption rather than breaking silence) is credibly earned. Only the grandfather memory tilts toward label-speak (“the words…echoed in the hollow of her chest”), keeping this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s obsessive need “to fuse insight with empathy” is embodied in the tactile ritual of siphoning love-static; his micro-choices (hovering fingers, slow breath, final decanting) reveal a hierarchy that prizes professional thoroughness above self-preservation. The cost is legible: he drinks the full contradictory emotion, leaving sorrow as personal residue—an earned, visible price. Interior contradiction is steady—tender detachment—without lapsing into diagnostic speak. Voice remains singular; no secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s shrewd-cargo-broker mind is shown in concrete metaphors (tonnage, tariffs, “emotional risk as freight”) and motivates the final gift; micro-gesture of sliding the envelope across starlit table embodies motive. Interior contradiction—caution versus exuberance—stays active in-scene, not summarized. The charitable pivot is credible because his occupation has already framed unseen labor as cargo worth insuring. Alina’s grief is rendered through tactile locket ritual rather than therapy-speak. Both characters read as individuals; no pronoun or biographical drift.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his “low hum inside his ribs,” the reed-bird dropped in a heartbeat—yet his contradictory pull between transience and permanence stays active in-scene. The micro-choice of pointing to the fissure, then weaving root-mats overnight, is causally tied to the need for belonging and carries visible cost (sleep, ego). Secondary pressure from Lyra is immediate and status shifts are cleanly staged. Final Earned Stasis—accepting the arbor-polishing cloth—pays off the earlier alienation; only the arbor’s symbolic heft feels slightly over-cued, trimming the last 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—he “adjusted his stool,” “poised” charcoal, and later “stepped to the edge”—each micro-choice under threat embodies the illustrator’s trained eye. The pendant inheritance is only mystery-label until it vibrates; that belated charge still lands because the prior sketching obsession established pattern-hunger. Flaw: no embodied contradiction during the crisis; he never doubts or hates the pendant that suddenly solves everything, so the change feels smooth rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—his fingers tracing chips as “data points” and the quiet invitation he sends through the glass eyes show embodied grief without therapy-speak. The contradiction between quantifying loss and surrendering to its emotional chaos is lived in scene, not declared. His final micro-choice—picking up the cooled eyes with “buried optimism”—earns a credible, visible cost: the void is renamed, not erased. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible inert, but the self-pressure is sufficient for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remain unseen yet desperate to matter—play out in real time as he risks exposure to plant the fragment. His embodied reaction (“quiet click of satisfaction”) and the precise micro-choice of aligning the label toward Anya reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The motivation scales credibly: from habitual retrieval of “faint magnetic ghosts” to a single high-stakes delivery that forecloses his anonymity. Cost is legible: once the tape is placed, his invisible way of life is jeopardized if ever traced.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to order while yearning to surrender—are embodied in raw knuckles and pocketed leaf; the final micro-choice (saw, not hammer) is earned. Interiority stays concrete, but the “circuitously sincere” trait is asserted more than dramatized in speech. Cost is felt in the ruined trellis and the sigh that releases months of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia is more than label: it warps perception, narrows patience, and drives the absurd quest. His “wryly earnest” self-mockery is lived-in, never explained, and the decision to give away the brooch for a story is a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses resale or hoarding. The woman’s sudden entrance is thin—no interiority, no status shift—but she functions as mirror, not crucible, so the primary interior arc remains intact and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s shift from guardian to midwife is embodied in the single gesture of lowering her hand; the shadow-merge beat makes the cost visceral. Kael remains a gentle catalyst, almost too pure, but the story keeps his wants foregrounded. Interiority is concrete and musical rather than analytic; clairvoyance loss is dramatized as silence, not label. The moment of self-recognition as “fearful jailer” lands because it’s forced by the present image, not retro-speech.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motives—collective memory as civic defibrillator—are embedded in every sift and catalogue; his tactile grief when the valve speaks and the micro-choice to display it on a pedestal rather than pocket it crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The woman’s entrance supplies second-character pressure, forcing Kaelen into a silent gift of witness that alters her posture and his own sense of usefulness. Interiority stays concrete—“phantom echo of brassy sound,” salt-beaded coat—never abstracting into thesis. Only minor flaw: the woman’s beat is largely expository; her agency is reactive, trimming top band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s mentor-loss motive is visceral, his “trembling certainty” embodied in brass hand and careful footfalls. The punch-as-fare device externalizes an internal contradiction: seeking answers while preparing to surrender agency. His micro-choices (punching air, stepping into black) earn the guardian transformation. Minor slip: “analytically artistic” is asserted twice rather than shown through idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational disdain versus tender obligation—grounds every beat; the micro-choice to keep the tile rather than hurl it is the pivot where skepticism cracks under love’s cost. Emotion is embodied (wind-bitten hands, trembling charcoal) rather than labeled. The only soft spot is the late label “courageously kind,” which briefly abstracts a trait already shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Xylos’ ennui-to-purpose arc is vivid: “his boredom had calcified into something… stronger than memory or pain” shows interior contradiction under pressure. The amulet as leash is handled twice—stasis bubble then embraced—so the object alters his stance. Final step across the rift is earned; cost is the erasure of immortality itself. Voice drift into cosmic grandiosity in last paragraph keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s need to “balance the cosmic ledger” is embodied in every micro-choice—cleaning tools, chilling skin, forging the certificate—so her final quiet receipt of the brachistochrone feels earned. The father-haunted interiority stays specific: she hears the universe settle in vent-whispers, not abstractions. Only minor slip: Mr. Silus remains a trembling prop; no reciprocal pressure tests her ethics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, obsessive patience is rendered through the bodily ritual of dawn charting; the contradiction between her ascetic isolation and her hunger for lost crowds is kept alive in every micro-choice. The final moment of incandescent restraint—hand stilling over the captured waveform—earns its cost because we have watched her hunger sharpen across precise motions. No interior label-speak; her motives surface only through tactile engagement with lamp, pencil, moss. The solitude keeps relationship crucible off-page, so the score caps just below the 9.0 gate that would require visible flaw-cost in a social dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nameless narrator’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a single poison label while trying to build a whole self from strangers’ fragments—are rendered in scene through the tactile layering ritual. Emotions are embodied (the “violet” of grief pressed against the “warm gold” of wonder) without diagnostic labels. The final Earned Stasis—renouncing official identity yet claiming a private memory—carries visible cost: the container empties and the horn shatters the composite self. interiority remains consistent, compressed, and particular to this ghostly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and character-specific—his “cheerful frustration” and quiet theater of memory reveal a coherent, obsessive psyche. The embodied emotion is present yet occasionally drifts toward lyric summary (“gloomy cheerfulness”) rather than visceral contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure (tuning, bowing, seashell placement) align with motives. Earned renunciation at the end is visible, but the cost feels more conceptual than bodily, keeping him just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s “orderly calm” versus love of anarchy is shown only in summary; no embodied contradiction plays out in-scene. The final gesture—holding the stone chip—offers a charged poise, but the cost (his world still slides toward gentrification) is acknowledged more than felt. Interiority stays competent yet generic; no moment forces him into visibly painful trade-off. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional specificity is mid-level.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interior contradiction between corporate duty and grandfather-haunted curiosity is embodied in the slow crush of the crystal—micro-choice with cost. Emotion is shown through the groaning heaters, the reverent camera clicks, the ache behind his eyes; no label-speak. The endurance of the night and the final photograph form a credible renunciation of company pragmatism. Only the “purposefully curious ache” flirts with abstraction, slightly blunting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s calm, tactile brilliance is lived-in: her blindness is never a superpower but a constraint that forces inventive methodology. Every micro-choice—dipping fingers, tracing seams—reveals a hierarchy of values: craft over self, precision over haste. The enduring cost is the audible draining of time, felt in the harbor horns; she forecloses rest, maybe future commissions, to finish. Interiority is concrete (“her useless eyes”) and never explanatory; the only flaw is near-perfect competence that edges toward sainthood.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet obsession and intellectual arrogance are vivid in every beat; the contradiction between his cartographer’s rationality and his mystical faith in “the singular convergence” drives every micro-choice. His embodied reactions—tea that can’t warm him, the hum through the floor—keep interiority concrete. The final moment of crystallized attention (“he was the sole archivist”) costs him his former identity; the price is felt. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority sustains pressure alone.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “infinitely patient” trait is shown through the deliberate cadence of his steps; the embodied rhythm convinces. No interior contradiction is dramatized, so the arc is more ritual than change, yet the portrayal is consistent and specific to him. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationships off the table, but his micro-choices—where and how he places each footfall—reveal a hierarchy of values: acoustic resurrection over personal rest.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s monomaniacal drive to bottle silence is rendered through visceral, embodied beats—kneeling, trembling, throat-scream that never leaves his mouth. Contradictory impulses (flee vs finish) coexist inside single beats, not in summary, and the final renunciation—choosing to die holding the vial—pays off a lifetime motive established in the opening paragraph. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-label (“instinct shrieked”) amid an otherwise pristine interiority; the cost of death is felt on the last breath.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s need to escape his father’s lie and own a “true” story drives every beat; his decision to break the seal is irreversible, with embodied dread in the finger-on-rust moment. Interiority stays concrete (“lie tasted on tongues,” “copperlight repose”) without label-speak. The cost—accepting eternal disbelief—lands as visible forfeiture on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid—stone bead in soil → marrow-chime, toxic dew burn—yet his memories remain imported: “he remembered giving her the bead,” not lived on-page. Contradictory impulses (hunger for knowledge vs. dread of poison) are implied but not forced into a single pressured moment; the final stance is acceptance, not choice. The cost is felt (Lyra dissolves), but Elian’s agency is largely receptive; still, within lyric-accumulative design this reads as credible renunciation. Voice-specific perception (“alchemical orchard,” “moon-petal vines”) keeps him individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet, fervent prayer to “carve a path from ruin to reverence” is the engine of every beat; his decision to run into the storm and bleed while anchoring the dream-threads converts private longing into public cost. The interior contradiction—optimism inside desolation—stays embodied (warm palm against cool copper, bleeding fingers on kelp-rope) rather than label-summarized. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is waived; the sole flaw is a micro-gap between sleepwalking grace and waking skill that never gets an on-page bridging micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for lineage yet doubting the stories—are dramatized in her tactile, slow-motion handling of earth and stone; the embodied cost (blisters, fatigue) is visible. The final realization that departure itself is the legacy is earned by her prior micro-choices to wander, touch, and postpone violent excavation. The “hollowing” is shown via her hesitation to taste the fruit, not told. Only the mason’s presence dilutes the crucible; he is a neutral tool, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—“quiet hum beneath his skin,” the taste of adhesive—but remains stable; no contradictory impulse is forced into crisis. His micro-choice to kneel and chalk is embodied, yet the stakes stay abstract: we see no moment where the false identity might fail him or cost him something now. The reflection block (≈18 %) is anchored to present tactile cues and tilts his stance toward analog trust, satisfying BRR. Still, the absence of live risk or interpersonal pressure keeps the characterization strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “foolish-old-woman” mask is vividly embodied in her slowed gestures and unassuming posture, while her interior needle-sharp calculus stays believably constrained to embroidery, eavesdropping, and one clandestine upload. The micro-choice to hijack the calibration channel grows directly from her established duality and costs her the safety of anonymity; the only minor slip is the off-page overhearing of “troop movements and timings,” which feels lightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s exhaustion and single-minded resolve are viscerally embodied; the shard’s cold weight and her whispered name-choice show micro-decisions under pressure. Kael’s silent weep lands as credible renunciation, not epiphany—his fear is shown, not labeled. The “fierce tenderness” is demonstrated when she risks collapse to give him the unsent truth. Only the off-stage “moon will knit her back” keeps the change from being fully paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulse—professional calm versus private ache—rides every beat; the coral fragment is fingered, not aired, keeping memory corporeal. His micro-choice to translate Anja’s symbols instead of exploiting them crystallizes his values and alters Varin’s stance, paying a visible cost: he forfeits strategic leverage for emotional truth. The “shrewdly innocent” persona is more label than dramatized contradiction, but the final moment—locking eyes with Varin while naming the thunder-fear—earns the shift. Interiority stays concrete; only the General’s flicker is ventriloquised, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is concrete— “quiet ache in his chest,” “hands feeling empty”—and the fresco fragment acts as an embodied, contradiction-holding object. The final beat earns a credible micro-choice: he accepts the bittersweet cost of transience rather than demanding permanence, foreclosing the option to stay inside the memory. The only drag is a slight over-reliance on diagnostic shorthand (“the joy had faded”) early on; under stress his voice stays specific (“breathless hush as the image snapped”), satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s methodical-playful nature is dramatized in every choice: the pocket-pat that finds the nickel, the systematic “survey” of the garden, the deliberate seven-bounce sequence. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (“absorbed by his bones,” “brush still poised”). The final smile crystallizes a credible renunciation of certainty; cost is felt in the mirrored nickel that now reflects only one wide eye. The apprentice stays functional backdrop, so status/relationship bullets don’t apply.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s guarded-charm façade and hidden desperation are palpable; the gourd-seed fondle and “raw steel” switch show earned layers. His final reckless-sacrifice turn, though, is announced more than psychologically built; we needed one earlier micro-choice demonstrating he’d risk civilians to foreshadow the mass-mind wipe he triggers.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradiction—insomniac yet quietly relentless—drives every beat; the moment she lifts the postcard to write the final poem her hands “do not tremble,” a micro-choice that crystallizes the arc. Interiority stays embodied (“calcium cathedral,” “salt-damp air”) without label-speak. The earned renunciation—lodging the postcard inside the shell—pays off the insomnia-as-soil premise with visible cost: she forever forsakes sleep-born release. Only the centuries-long span is told, not dramatized, blunting flaw exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is rich—his grief-tinged ritualism embodied in the cracked bamboo—and his single micro-choice (to blow the note) carries visible cost. The foxglove regret that coats his mouth is a perfect, bodily stamp of the price paid. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the arc is more procession than crucible, but the endurance itself is credibly weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his breath held tight, the cautious exuberance under his skin, the frantic beat of his heart against his steady hand. The contradiction between scholarly precision and reckless desperation is dramatized in the micro-choice of cutting his own blood into the ink. His love for Elara is shown through the risk he takes with the proto-Aenic modification, not declared. The final gesture—Elara reaching for his hand—lands as earned stasis: the spell could still shatter, but the relational path is reopened at visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s grief-quest is credibly rooted in the envelope and chain, and the micro-choice to scrape glue launches the arc. His interiority—“pressure and release,” “encoded compassion”—stays inside his machinist idiom, though a trace of self-diagnosis slips in at “the truth settled over him.” The final stance crystallizes with cost: he inherits both regulator and father’s self-denial. One hairline slip keeps it from 8+: we are told rather than shown the moment he actively forgives or accepts the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to Lena’s music while fabricating new pasts—are dramatized in the dust-ritual and the tarpaulin scramble; the final gift of the scroll crystallizes a credible shift from hoarding to sharing, paying the cost of vulnerability. Interiority is concrete (“words tasting like ash”), never diagnostic. The only minor slack is Anna’s near-perfect attunement, which softens the crucible slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—tracing wood grain under impossible skies—but his emotional shifts occasionally tip into diagnostic self-labeling (“necessary distances,” “sacred thresholds”). The micro-choice to read the spiral as ‘spacial sheer’ is sharp and stakes his life on pattern-recognition, yet the father-haunted motive flirts with template angst. Still, his final kneel on the plain chair earns a credible renunciation: he pays with permanent exile and the loss of prismatic color. The contradiction between wanting answers and accepting unbridgeable separation is dramatized, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s ache for “belonging” is concrete—he fondles the feather, maps geothermal pulses, stakes his last minutes on the light-jelly show. Elara’s arc from curt disbelief to tear-soft awe is visible in her reflection and single whispered line. The shared exhale crystallizes a new relational state with felt cost: the station is still dying, but they are no longer alone. Interiority stays specific to Kaelen’s astrologer lens; no stock labels, though “rhythm of belonging” flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s curiosity-driven motive is crisp and consistent, and the embodied ritual of conjecture shows micro-choices under pressure. Missing is any interior contradiction or felt personal cost: the victory is pure epiphany, not a renunciation that hurts. Interiority stays concrete—“hummed a buoyant, three-note tune,” “cool to the touch”—but never turns against itself. Earned, but not yet haunted; the recollectionist remains a charming profession more than a flawed person.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete (chess-piece thumb-press, channel-digging calculus) and his micro-choices alter the environment, but the “why” never tightens beyond the abstract desire to “serenade monotony.” No visible cost or contradiction is dramatized; he exits unchanged, so the renunciation feels ornamental rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is lush—his dance is a need, not rebellion—but “memory is not a disease” drifts toward thesis-speak near the peak. His embodied contradiction (craving connection while embracing exile) stays active in scene, yet the final beat edges into tidy calibration: the cosmic verse appears and his stance flips almost painlessly. Cost is felt (obsidian skin, unerasable), still the pivot from translator-stuck to cosmically-anchored hinges on a single inward gasp more than on a prior mistake or risk. That keeps him just shy of the 9-band where earned flaws must visibly bite.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is glass-specific and sensory—light-bending, salt texture, calloused hands—never abstract therapy-speak. The final renunciation is fully seeded by the pond-ripple epiphany and the decade-long obsession with static light; cost is visible in the dawn rainbow that atomizes his monument. Flaw: the “noctilucent reckonings” phrase drifts toward label-speak, momentarily loosening embodiment. Still, motivation, flaw, and change cohere under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory tenderness toward the box and the rookies is dramatized in the arm/shoulder pivot that costs his face; Kaelen’s mute reach mirrors it. Interiority stays concrete—“the topography of his pain”—never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: porcelain > own flesh. No safety-hedging: he owns the “stupid choice.” Earned stasis lands cleanly: the cracked relic stays his, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is sharp and embodied—she “considered the grotto her laboratory,” a perfect crystallization of method and wonder. Her recursive shell-pattern is an active, high-stakes micro-choice that externalizes her mind. The only drag is the slight over-labeling of “logical dreamer,” a near-diagnostic tag that momentarily flattens the contradiction she otherwise dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s quiet obsession—mapping what walls “dream”—is vivid and embodied; her gentle handling of the scorched journals shows a hierarchy of values. Yet her interior contradiction (curiosity vs. the vow to leave the burden behind) is told rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final renunciation is credible but cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s calm is repeatedly shown to enable the ritual; his borrowed heartbeat externalizes empathy without lapsing into label-speak. No contradictory interiority; the final renunciation—he walks away emptied—carries visible cost. Because no second character shares the scene, relationship bullets are waived. Micro-choices (the hum, the hand-lift) are few but pivotal; just shy of the 9-band because we never feel his private jeopardy, only the city’s.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingers cool on the clipboard, his voice “operatively gentle”—and his contradictory impulse to ritualize politics instead of argue it is dramatized in scene. The micro-choice to scrape dust and draw the sigil is a visible, costly concession to mysticism that forecloses his rational posture. The generals remain granite masks, yet their tremor and surrender are credibly rooted in war-weariness Elias gambles on. Closure is earned: his earlier exhaustion bet pays off when both enemies sign, foreclosing war at personal cost of credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interiority is rich and specific—Vance’s self-loathing, the memory of birdsong, the tremble in fingers that once signed ecosystems away. Contradictory impulses (profit vs. penance) coexist in the same moment rather than alternating. The final renunciation is earned by the sustained ache of that memory and carries visible cost: the egg’s dissolution is also the erasure of the last possible song. Only the “amoral philanthropist” label is asserted more than dramatized, a minor safety-hedge that keeps this out of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s chastity-as-weapon and refusal to barter her soul are crisp, embodied motives; the danced “un-knotting” dramatizes an internal contradiction between complicity and rebellion. Yet the judge’s echo—the final knot—arrives too late to test or alter her tactics; we watch perfection rather than witness a new micro-choice that costs her something fresh. The result is a luminous stasis, not an earned wound.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s urbane-calligrapher persona is vividly embodied in early micro-gestures—fluid bend to retrieve the stick, brush-on-vellum recall—yet his contradictory impulses (serenity vs. vivisectionist doubt) are dramatized in real time, not summarized. The final decision to “reverse the trajectory” is foreshadowed by tactile re-examination of the carved alder, so the choice carries visible cost: he accepts Elara’s accusation as a constraint on future art. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak; even the metaphor “meteor hush” is filtered through his stargazer sensibility. Only the prior relationship with Elara is sketched off-stage, but that is within BRR allowance for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent, tactile, and embodied; the moth-wing tool anchors micro-choices without epiphany-speak. The final renunciation—packing the wing and walking away—carries visible cost yet feels slightly under-causal because the decision is never actively resisted or endangered; stakes plateau rather than compound. Still, his esoteric-realist lens shapes every beat, and the earned stasis is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent; the “technically gentle” trait is lived through tactile braiding of kelp threads, not merely asserted. The contradiction between his past failure and present precision is dramatized in every micro-choice, and the final act of sketching the sigil shows an earned hierarchy of values (memory over sound). Closure cost is felt: he accepts that light, not voice, is the best he can give, and we see that limitation on the page. Minor cap: no second character on page, so relationship/status bullets not tested; single-POV interiority alone is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—“hands… perceived through memory of their shape”—and the final micro-choice of eating the seal is earned by the dream logic that precedes it. The contradiction between inherited duty and present impotence is kept alive in every beat. Cost is felt: he starves himself into the transcendence that dissolves the gray present. Voice-specific perceptual signature stays intact under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kavi’s hoarding of silence and starlight is embodied in lived ritual; his frugality underwrites every gesture and his final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority remains particular—“empirically ironic” self-tagging is shown through action, not label. The single-scene crucible works because his trait becomes the instrument of revelation; no contradiction under pressure. Only the absence of a second on-page figure prevents full pressure from status/relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s pacifist-schemer duality is dramatized through the tactile memory campaign; her refusal to weaponize anything costs her the sanctuary’s silence and her own dissolution—visible price on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“broadcast the sensation of warmth on skin”) rather than abstract. The final fade-out is earned because every prior tactic has depleted her substance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific craftswoman confronting her own grief through sympathetic magic—rings true; her embodied emotion (the frozen tear) and micro-choice to breathe onto the glass ground every beat. The broken sextant handled twice and the final grip of its cold metal give visible cost to her renunciation, earning the 9- gate. Small slip: “steady hand and focused heart” edges toward label-speak; stay inside concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—his quartz-eye perception steers every beat—and his contradictory impulses (cling vs. let go) play out in embodied gestures on the branch. The final renunciation (leaving ribbon, embracing change) is earned by the remembered quarrel and the seed epiphany, so the cost is felt. Lyra remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is not tested on the page; the score reflects single-POV depth only. Minor −0.2 for one “wave of accidental wisdom” that edges toward label-speak, though it is immediately dramatized by the seed insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelen’s curiosity is vivid early, but the interiority never complicates; he never doubts, fears, or chooses—he simply “has to know.” The breakthrough is a pure cognition drop, not an earned renunciation or costly crystallization, so no visible price attaches to his stance shift. Without contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure, the arc is observational rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from detached scholar to risk-taking negotiator is coherent and embodied; her tactile engagement with the diary and the silence wall shows interior conflict without label-speak. The micro-choice to confront the Curators is earned by weeks of obsessive gap-hunting and the future-man’s warning, so the cost (terrifying renegotiation) feels scaled to this length. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal contradiction bar for 9+ is missed, but the portrayal is still vivid and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a brother she never met while risking self-erasure—are dramatized in each swatch test; the final renunciation (“She would be his story”) is earned by the prior cascade of memory bleed. Interiority stays concrete, but the brother remains a blank receptor; a single remembered gesture (brass pole vs glamour) is sharp, yet we get no parallel micro-choice from him to complicate her longing. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: identity < guardianship, and the cost is the sudden cold loneliness she names on the last page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s calmly obsessive translator-mind feels lived-in; every beat is filtered through his cataloguer’s gaze, giving us contradiction-free interiority and embodied micro-choices (“soft-soled shoes making no sound”). The final quiet acceptance of the new reading-room lands as earned stasis that costs him his monopoly on certainty. No genuine flaw, only a slight underplay of the personal price he pays.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen’s solitude and singular purpose are sharply etched; his interiority stays concrete—eyes tracing ice-forks, bones protesting, blood-whisper at climax. The stoic mapkeeper persona is internally coherent, yet the story leans on professional label (“ripple-mark mapkeeper”) rather than letting a contradictory private want complicate his public role. Micro-choices—rising, carrying the fragile ice, releasing the pattern—map directly onto the bloom of hush payoff, so motivation stays causal and costly. No second character to pressure status, but that absence is within default for length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift as curse vs library—grounds every micro-choice; the shard-handling beat embodies grief and hope at once. The final press costs him the comforting myth of randomness, a legible renunciation. Only the father-label “curse” flirts with diagnostic speak, not enough to dent the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s preemptive nostalgia is more label than lived contradiction; still, his final choice to record the choice-to-forget is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of inherited innocence. Interiority is vivid (“a string pulled too tight”) and his embodied dread under lightning flashes tracks. The flaw: the micro-choice chain is thin—one measurement sprint—so the turn feels slightly under-cooked for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—art as fleeting rebellion vs need for permanence—drives every beat; the rag-knot triggers the decisive perceptual pivot and the final grin carries felt cost after months of despair. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Micro-choices (chant shifts, wall-scan) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Earned stasis: he accepts the silence as canvas, foreclosing the search for a bottled cure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's tidal-pool chronicler mindset is vividly shown through her attention to the snail and her habitual deflection from raw pain; the jade cicada anchors her internal contradiction. The final renunciation is earned because her micro-choices (thumb-stroking, watching the snail) dramatize the shift. However, Kael remains a static sounding board; his interiority is assumed, not demonstrated, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s contradictory hunger for silence and terror of enclosure is embodied in micro-choices—tracing the doll, pushing upward into open sky—so the final “green and living tendril” of courage feels earned. Yet the father, though off-stage, is sketched only by received adjectives (“gilded hush”), so the filial crucible is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s calm, didactic interiority is consistent and embodied; the passenger’s arc from panic to poise is shown through micro-relaxation rather than labels. No contradictory impulses in scene—both remain archetypal vessels for the concept. Cost is present but light: he gives away a sliver of his solitude, she leaves lighter; the emotional ledger feels balanced yet not sharply priced. Still, the characterization cleanly serves the closure’s Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her sonic hum vibrates “from her chest into the rock,” anchoring both ritual and personality. The peel-by-peel reveal of past failures shows her historian’s mind in action, each micro-choice (sonic chisel angle, flake pressure) calibrated to memory rather than conquest. The renunciation of the crown is earned: she has already paid in time-bled fingertips and the orchard’s ozone sting, so the final walk-away carries visible cost. Only the “wisely adventurous” tag feels slightly label-like mid-text, keeping this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s survivor-guilt and bolt-totem are vivid, but the “virtuously mischievous” trait is asserted not dramatized until the lie to overseers—one beat too late to feel ingrained. Interiority is concrete; contradictory impulses (flee vs. claim) coexist in the screw-in moment. Closure renunciation is earned—pressure converted to literal diamonds—so the arc lands. Voice cadence slips into explanatory cadence (“her life’s ambition had crystallized”) that flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorily anchored and grows under pressure; the moment she “slumped back on her heels” embodies the cost of new knowledge. Motivation stays clean: discover truth → grasp sacrifice → accept peace. The final micro-choice—pulling the crank free as “testament”—earns its pivot. Only nit: the lineage back-story is summarized, not dramatized, so dynasty-flaw depth feels once-removed.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—stoic guardian yet dream-chaser—is embodied in the gauntlet clasp he must sever; the gesture is costly and irreversible. Micro-choices (tracing patterns, thumb on latch) externalize the hierarchy of values without label-speak. The lone flaw: no second character means relationships/status bullets are moot, slightly thinning crucible pressure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grief used as a lens for archival tenderness—is vivid and embodied. The micro-choice to preserve rather than confiscate the button crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No secondary character pressure, but the single-POV arc earns a credibly weighted shift. The “tactfully hopeful” close feels earned because the button’s cost is tangibly handled and archived.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s “mid-level archivist” camouflage and her refusal to be a visible hero are sharply particular; the interior line “they would never look for…” immediately grounds her motivation in invisibility. The moment she slides the key and the golden water swirls around her ankles, her body is in scene and the cost is felt: she is alone, wet, cold, broadcasting doubt with no exit. That final freeze in the booth is a credible Earned Stasis—she forecloses personal safety yet the text never over-explains. Interiority stays concise and sensory; no diagnostic self-talk, no competence porn—only the quiet hierarchy of values we see when she chooses the lever over the receiver.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—he feels “familiar dread clench” and chooses micro-actions (unlatching the case, fixing eyes on the prism). The inherited duty and rain-scented memory give contradictory impulses; his renunciation of the prophecy’s syntax is credibly earned, costing him ongoing solitude. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: silence > personal future. The only minor slip is “eerie nostalgia” named twice, not embodied in fresh gesture at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s quiet, precise nature is vividly embodied in the soil-and-chlorophyll stains and the ritual of sorting; the interior contradiction between placid routine and the ache to “decode” sustains tension. Yet the moment of transformation is slightly under-cooked—his final identity shift is declared rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs him something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied; his “slow, heavy rhythm of a grandfather clock” anchors contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices (whittling sap, balancing the rose) dramatize his hierarchy of values with visible cost—he forecloses the surface world for the cavern’s chaos. The Earned Stasis—choosing to “become part of the question”—is foreshadowed by prior fixation on broken clocks, so the renunciation feels inevitable, not abstract. No safety-hedging; flaws drive the final posture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-rich: grief, scientific rigor, and self-aware futility braid in real time. Micro-choices—rolling the coin, feeding the furnace, pouring his own energy—track a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final, luminous renunciation is earned by the escalating sacrifice and anchored in the coin’s transformed state. Minor slip: “luminous regret” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting full immediacy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s vocation and gentle insistence on joy over pain drive every beat; the crocodile-tooth anchor and his tactile ritual with it embody his modest fearlessness and keep interiority embodied. The spirit’s shift from keening to laughter is credible because Silas first filters her anguish through the tooth’s “silent, solid presence,” a micro-choice that earns the later dissolution. No stock therapeutic labels—only concrete sensory memory (the sun-drenched tavern, pies, helpless laughter) performs the healing. The cost is quiet but legible: he climbs out alone, the tooth now warm, satisfaction edged with perpetual solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s hyper-lucid body-knowledge and the “mathematics of mercy” obsession give him a sharp, memorable interiority; every step triggers a new traumatic memory-body loop, so choices feel driven by biology as much as will. The arc—from victim to deliberate experimenter—lands credibly because each micro-choice (grip on strap, stance under tree) externalizes the shift. No contradictory impulses are dramatized simultaneously, so the interior conflict is more sequential than layered, and the final stance is more acceptance than change, but the cost (permanence of enhancement) is visible and painful.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s vocation as “between-worlds translator” is credibly embodied: the pocketed lens, the deliberate mis-painting, and the grandfather’s whisper all feed one continuous interior mission. Emotion stays physical—tightened fingers, the sudden lighter glass—rather than label-heavy. The final renunciation (history freed, lens lighter) is earned by the scene’s micro-choices and carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but modest; we feel duty but little self-doubt, so the arc is more ritual than fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s childlike curiosity is concrete and embodied—dust on the rungs, face tilted up, fingers reading brass. The ghost’s calm dissolution charges the final image with visible cost; Leo’s choice to ascend is a micro-choice that re-weights his “weightless burden.” Interior voice stays in his lexicon of mechanisms and angles; no diagnostic jargon. The only minor drag is the late, summary-rich vision flash that tells us the stakes instead of dramatizing them under the rafters.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Operator’s desire to “compress eternity into a moment” is stated early and never contradicted, giving a crisp through-line. Yet the character remains a silhouette: no interior contradiction, no bodily emotion, no micro-choice that costs them anything on the page. Their final laying of a hand on the press reads as symbolic rather than a fork in a lived life. We witness a cosmic act, but not a human one.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—scholar vs. failed revolutionary—drives every beat; the shard-touch micro-choice that re-weights the thesis is embodied, costly, and irreversible. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Burnished-sorrow voice risks self-mythologizing but stays anchored to tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s humble self-definition (“I am a music box repairman”) is the only interiority that truly cuts; the rest drifts into abstract virtue labels (“honest love,” “pure conviction”) instead of embodied contradiction. The moment he converts global doom into a single mechanical task is believable because the text has shown his tactile joy in gears, but the epiphany beat still leans therapeutic-summary rather than a specific, costly micro-choice. Earned stasis lands, yet the lack of any interpersonal crucible or visible bodily toll keeps it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s collector-identity drives every beat: vials in pack, compass as divining rod, refusal to bottle the impossible scent. Interiority is concrete—“petrichor unlike any she had ever known: less of earth and more of starlight and stone.” Psychometry costs her stamina and changes her path; the final renunciation leaves the compass behind with felt, scaled cost. The only slack is absence of contradictory impulse mid-crisis; she glides from curiosity to reverence without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s sculptor identity, tactile driftwood eye, and sudden custodian shift are vividly embodied; her “desperate sync” under wave-threat shows contradictory fear/duty live in scene. The solo POV keeps interiority concrete; only the final “remembering and rebuilding” feels a shade declarative, not fully paid in muscle-memory. Closure choice is earned: the sculpture-bulwark she builds literally uses her lifetime craft to honor the pact—visible cost in soaked, shuddering body. One micro-slip keeps her just under 9: “world was not broken, merely disconnected” drifts into thesis-speak without sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—public colorist vs. private nocturnal seeker—remains embodied and active, driving every return to the cathedral; the final recognition of inherited identity is earned by the layered glass ritual, not stated. Micro-choices (night visits, filter angles) externalize her hierarchy of values; cost is the solitary labor and the surrender of daylight certainties. No stock therapeutic labels; the “umbral tenderness” is shown through tactile glass work. The only minor slack: no secondary pressure from another on-page character, but the single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority—his surrender to the reverie, the micro-choice to shift from interrogation to legacy—is vivid and embodied. The contradiction between archival duty and psychic captivity is dramatized, not labeled. Still, the antagonist remains a heat-haze cipher, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is one-sided; the earned shift lands but with only half the possible cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s refusal of “false comfort” and his granular, sensory memory-work make his interiority vivid and specific; the slow accretion of lanterns from memory-beats gives each micro-choice visible cost. The alchemist identity is mostly atmospheric—no occupational detail alters tactics—so the vocational crucible is thin. Still, the endurance of grief and the decision to begin again are earned through embodied memory rather than epiphany, satisfying the 9− test.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—archivist of feeling vs. savior by amnesia—is dramatized in the moment he presses the wax shaving to his mind; the embodied shudder of “phantom thrum” and the cloying apple-blossom scent externalize the cost. His oath to preserve vs. duty to erase crystallizes in a single, irreversible renunciation that lands with felt price. No diagnostic self-labeling; the flaw (curiosity/hubris) drives the fatal discovery. Voice stays idiosyncratic: maritime memory as tuning fork is character-specific and non-transferable.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-laden (“furiously tranquil” is enacted, not labeled). The micro-choice to invite rather than pull threads shows values hierarchy with cost. Closure is earned: her stance crystallizes and the lineage chorus is felt, not declared. Minor slip: “texture of borrowed time” is named twice—once as motive, once as payoff—slightly abstract on first mention.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s quiet obsession with the “song under the sirens” is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—tracing harmonics, locating the rope, diverting power—so his final act feels earned. Interiority stays specific (“solstice hush that seemed to seep from the very bones”) rather than abstract. The only flaw: the “credibly curious” trait is declared twice; once would suffice.

    Kael’s interiority is textured—his ritual with the lantern glass, the hush he tends like moss, the moment he “opens himself to the star’s journey.” The empathy beat is credible because the prose stays in embodied perception rather than label-speak. The earned shift from isolation to fiery grace lands with visible cost: he remains the sweeper of dust, now knowing dust as “the memory of light.” A hairline slip: the phrase “spiritually curious” is told once in exposition rather than shown; since the trait drives the climax, the absence of earlier dramatized micro-choice keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is rich—his muteness, guilt, and tender regard for the spectral Lyra feel lived-in, and the final shared gaze is a credible micro-choice that reconfigures their state. The “tranquilly perceptive” trait is shown through quiet attention rather than label-speak. Flaw: his decade of prior choices is summarized; we’re told he believed silence sacred rather than shown earlier beats where that belief cost him, so the renunciation feels slightly under-cooked. Still, the embodied sorrow and final nod earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s obsession with “texture of time” is embodied in tactile rituals (holding the shard for hours) and micro-choices (inventing the coded garage-sale board). The final moment of borrowed-time erasure is earned by these cumulative acts, so the renunciation feels credible and costly. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, relying instead on bone-light and sand-slippage metaphors that stay sensory. Flaws (obsession, loneliness) actively complicate the quest instead of serving as decorative back-story.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s interiority is consistently textured—his attention to “half-erased swirl of a whelk shell” and the “melancholic sigh of the tide” shows a distinct perceptual signature. The micro-choice to kneel, lift, and pocket the feather crystallizes his aesthetic creed without overt self-diagnosis. The emotional arc—ache at the child’s loss → quiet composition → feather anchor—carries visible cost (he forfeits verbal comfort for solitary art), earning the Earned Stasis closure. No therapy-speak; contradictions stay submerged rather than dramatized, a hair’s-breadth short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, embodied obsession—copper against bark, geological patience—carries the piece; the dying caretaker’s calm is never diagnostic, always tactile. His “brazen calm” modulates under bodily erosion: each spiral of wire costs breath and balance, so the final slump against the thrumming pillar feels like earned surrender rather than symbolic pose. The only absence is a second consciousness to push back, but the island itself becomes that antagonist, its silence forcing his interior contradictions into visible labor. Closure is a visual renunciation: the circle drawn in the diary closes his life and opens the orchard’s, cost paid in slackening heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Aris’s skeptical-scientist lens is vivid and embodied; every beat is filtered through his intellectual reflex to rename wonder into data. The contradictory pull between scorn and anticipatory prickle is held in scene, not alternated in summary. His final micro-choice—placing the amber—earns its renunciation because the prior causality has already forced him to re-price isolation vs convergence. Interiority never slips into label-speak; even “chemistry of homecoming” is framed as an hypothesis he intends to test.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s quiet atonement is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, pinching loam, selecting a seed—so motive stays visceral. Interiority is sparse but particular: “a library of potential futures” compresses guilt and hope without label-speak. No contradiction pulses inside him, so the arc is steady endurance rather than change; the cost is the emptied satchel, felt on the last line. Still, the absence of a live opposing will keeps the crucible one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s ache-to-bridge-distance motive stays concrete through tactile actions—stroking waxed leaf, decoding grooves, kneeling at the sapling; each micro-choice is traceable to the core want. Barrow’s nose-led shifts from rest to alert to final sigh externalize stakes without anthropomorphizing. Internal contradiction surfaces once (despair at “simple crack”) but is overridden by persistent ceremony; cost is the two-day trek and the irreversible pivot from searching to tending. No stock interiority; every beat is filtered through sensory minutiae of scrap-metal world.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied (“temporally stretched, like an old recording played at the wrong speed”) and her micro-choices—donning the jacket, opening the brittle sketchbook, letting charcoal fall—trace a credible arc from isolation to chosen agency. The contradiction between craving a fixed “true north” and ultimately rejecting it is dramatized, not stated. Cost is felt: she gasps, fingers numb, and the jacket’s once-comforting compass rose suddenly “quaintly simplistic.” Only a hairline slip: the beat of “confusion into exploration” is named more than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “wonder-thief” ethic is vivid—bare-hand climb, sundial beam as misdirection, seed planted not loot taken—yet the interior contradiction between reverence and audacity is asserted more than dramatized in-scene; still, the final lightness versus Sylas’s dazed awe shows earned micro-change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s shift from feigned to lived grief is viscerally embodied in the tear-streaked climax; the contradictory impulses—survival guilt versus defiant witness—coexist in her paced alphabetic rebellion. The Regent’s “benevolently ruthless” mask cracks via micro-gesture (thumb tremor) that echoes the knight’s click, making status dynamics legible. Micro-choice hierarchy is crisp: witness testimony > personal safety, paid for with the ash-taste memory and the final silent stare. Cost is felt: she trades her anonymity for the prisoner’s release, a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyric, embodied, and contradicts itself in real time (“the thunder in her chest had finally broken”). Every micro-choice—shelving cartography, pocketing the stone, planting teacup herbs—reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only flaw is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she understood now”) right at closure, blunting the purest band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in the tactile manipulation of the sphere; the “simple, defensive move” epiphany is earned because we have watched the labyrinth click through prior beats. Interior contradiction is present—pride vs duty—yet the prince remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only remembered, not live. The final “truce” is credible renunciation with felt cost. Hairline slip: “forgive oneself” verges on label-speak, but the next sentence grounds it in the chess metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet mastering the canyon’s hush—grounds every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned because her playful poetics have already bled real fear into Kael. The “innocently mischievous” mask never slips into label-speak; instead it surfaces as tactile behavior (whispered rhymes timed to echo cadence). Cost is visible: Kael’s panic and her own arrested breath foreshadow the closing capture. Only the single-POV default keeps this from 9+ territory—no relational crucible beyond brief Kael spike.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “phantom scent of soil” and lung-pressure objectify memory and stakes. Contradictory impulses—doubt vs love—co-exist in-scene and culminate in a renunciation that costs her last breath, earned. The coral-as-anchor micro-choice hierarchy is legible under acid-sea pressure. Minor slip: “alchemist only by the grace of doubt” is label-speak, but it is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief’s pull versus the need to finish the ritual—stay alive in the cave: he hesitates, traces the shell, then opens his fingers. The final release is earned because every beat before it has rehearsed the cost of letting go. Interiority is concrete (“the weight in his soul felt… like his own again”) rather than abstract. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV interior arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s quiet-versus-loud conviction is concrete and embodied; the vial cork acts as a tactile extension of his mother-memory, grounding interiority. The “gentle scream” contradiction is felt in body and image, not labels. His renunciation of Hemlock’s shouting path is visible and costs him the last of the scent, yet the moment of agency is slightly under-dramatized—held internally rather than staged as a micro-choice we watch him wrestle with aloud or in gesture. Still, flaws are character-specific and the endurance leaves a palpable residue.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored motives stay legible; the bronze censer foot as tactile talisman embodies his need. Micro-choice—slotting it into the cradle—crystallizes his values, paying the visible cost of accepting perpetual absence. Interiority is concrete yet leans on “geography of loss” abstraction once; still, the embodied tremor in his palm keeps therapy-speak at bay. Closure earns credible endurance: he broadcasts solace he will never receive, a stasis that forecloses self-rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s compulsive honesty and the glass-eye gambit are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (the storm-press, the temple-touch, the first withheld sentence). The final “It is peaceful here” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost: he forfeits total candor to keep Lena’s memory private. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes. The neighbor is thin but functions only as pressure trigger, so cast limit is met.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, patience, and empirical intuition are shown through tactile rituals (sugar, map, chip) that externalize interiority; his final refusal to enter the doorway crystallizes a believable arc of acceptance. The contradictory pull between belief in Elara’s absurd method and his own rational skepticism is lived in scene, not summarized. Cost is visible when he lowers the chip and the dissolved doorway leaves him with the lived ache of the path actually taken. Voice stays coherent and particular to a quiet, widowed cartographer who trusts observable patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s disenchantment is embodied in her tactile rejection of court silk and her hunger for “grit of the rock”; the final refusal to surrender memory is earned by the grotto’s unveiled cost. Kael’s loyalty is shown only in gesture and silence, giving steady counter-pressure without stealing focalization. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and the micro-choice to turn back carries visible price: she accepts the cage she loathes to spare others the void.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—math-desire vs. live-heart need—drives every beat; the micro-choice to drop the nautilus and channel grief into glass crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Kael’s understated departure motive and silent tear keep him from becoming a mere trigger. If the nautilus dismissal had carried a sentence of body-level regret, she’d hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jealousy of past selves is a sharp, idiosyncratic motive; the embodied nausea of “phantom ache of a future headstone” makes envy visceral. Interior contradiction plays live—dream-flight memory vs. grave-knowledge—driving the micro-choice to attempt the trance. The recorded shift from triage to artistry is visible in the final charcoal stroke, paying the cost of lost innocence. Voice stays particular, though one stock phrase (“profound jealousy”) slightly flattens peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—healing others through touch while living in a scentless void—drives every micro-choice; the screw-reading beat embodies her new vocation with tactile precision. The old man’s grief is sketched more as label than contradiction, but his trembling still supplies external pressure that forces Elara to act, not merely reminisce. The ending renunciation—she breathes empty air and feels weight, not absence—earns its poise via prior causal chain of sensory substitution. Character competence is balanced by visible fragility (hand tremor, cloth-polishing ritual), satisfying the flaw/struggle test.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction— scholarly rationalism vs. folkloric surrender— is dramatized in a single, embodied beat: the crow-quill touch that names scars. The crystal-shedding moment feels earned because earlier academic failures were shown, not told. Cost is visible: the fragile clean skin revealed is literally new flesh, foreclosing the old identity. Micro-choices under pressure (“Hesitation,” “Pride,” whispered) keep voice particular; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Julian’s need to apologize is embodied and specific, but the interior contradiction—wanting absolution while dreading the rawness of contact—could be sharper in the first beat. The micro-choice to hand over the perfume bottle crystallizes hierarchy of values, yet his passivity while Vex rigs the device slightly blunts agency under pressure. Earned stasis lands because the cost is felt: the lilac scent fades, the orchard will still fall, and the apology changes nothing external, only internal terrain. Voice stays coherent, but “a deluge of sensation” skates dangerously close to therapy-speak summary; one more physical tic could have sealed the hairline gap.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Witness’s solitary spiral walk externalizes her internal descent; every step is a micro-choice that peels back selfhood. Her motive—unifying word with hush—remains legible and intensifies toward the silent drop of the dictionary. The interiority is concrete (“the boundary between her thoughts and the hush began to thin”) and the final renunciation costs her identity, visible in the moment she “stopped witnessing and simply became.” No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, however, keeping her arc a single vector rather than a knife-edge tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with “what clocks really measure” is concrete and lived-in; his ritual counting from 72 to clear his mind is a vivid micro-choice that reveals both profession and temperament. The interior contradiction—precision shepherd vs. seeker of wild, pre-human time—stays active through the final image. The renunciation (leaving the ice shard untouched) costs him his former identity as corrector; that cost is felt in the last line. Only lack of secondary pressure caps this at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s spatial gift and grief-physics obsession are concrete and embodied; the micro-choice to aim the resonator crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays character-specific—“phantom weight of her hand”—without therapy-speak. The earned renunciation lands with visible exhaustion, though the backstory block (≈18% of text) is a single dense slab rather than interleaved beats, slightly flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s shift from statistical safety to intuitive pilgrimage is embodied in micro-choices (brushing pollen, lighting the lantern) and internal contradiction (“beautiful certainty of numbers” vs “raw, untethered beauty”). The cost—accepting her father’s chaos—lands as Earned Stasis. One slip: the phrase “clover melancholy” is used twice as label, not embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas’s interiority is sparse yet consistent—his estrangement is shown through ritualized micro-actions (rotary phone, velvet pouch) rather than labels. The caller remains a disembodied voice, so relationship/status dynamics cannot apply, but Silas’s own contradictory impulse—absolute isolation that still craves utility—surfaces in the moment he re-loops the man’s goodbye. No visible flaw complicates his choice; the cost is purely conceptual (perpetual solitude), which fits the length but caps emotional depth. The absence of a second corporeal character prevents crucible pressure, so the characterization plateau at strong-functional, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is sensor-rich and profession-specific; the “gentle thoroughness” trait is enacted in the chemical baptism scene. Yet the leap from “I must save this photo” to “I must walk to the jetty tonight” is externally authored—no visible cost or contradiction inside her forces the move, so the final choice feels plot-engineered rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s quiet desperation—turning the moon rock, asking pigeons for the opposite of quarantine—embodies his loneliness in concrete, character-specific gestures. His decision to seed the rumor and then step back, offering skills not relics, shows a believable shift from magical thinking to community catalyst, paid for by remaining outside the circle he sparks. Interiority stays sharp: “quiet desperation of the truly isolated” is a label, yet it is instantly embodied by the trolley creak and ivy drip. The cost is palpable: he winds the clock but stays on the platform’s edge, alone by the fire he helped kindle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen’s tactile synesthesia is embodied in every beat—pressing bark, tracing fossils, turning the ring—so interiority stays concrete. Grief for Elara is shown through sensory overload, never named, and the final harmony lands as earned stasis: he renounces literal silence, accepting composite grief. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the ring acts as proxy antagonist. Micro-choices (etching C-sharp, turning into emptiness) crystallize his hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete—‘frantic, delicate dance’ shows embodied tension—and the pen’s tactile recall anchors guilt. The contradictory impulse to edit vs. annotate is held in-scene, not summarized. Final renunciation is credible, but emotional cost is slightly under-cooked: we see him ‘slacken’ but don’t feel the visceral sting of letting the colony remain doomed.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s contradiction—seeking music in silence—remains embodied through gesture and camera work; Lyra’s disembodied advice sharpens his micro-choices. The final renunciation (no film, no audience) costs him any future performance, a price legible in the closing walk-away. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The lone weakness: Lyra’s pressure is memory-only, so relationship-as-crucible does not activate, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s grief-borne obsession is viscerally embodied in the worn tapestry and in the way he “clutches” and “aligns” it; the interior contradiction between arsonist past and curator future is alive in the final beat. The sister’s absence is made present through the trail of mole-carving, pin-pricked stars—each a micro-choice that re-weights his stake. The shift from torch to brush is earned, costly, and crystallizes his identity. No secondary characters appear, so relationship bullets are waived; the arc is solo but fully credible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grief braided into marrow yet still reaching for their dream—grounds every beat. Her embodied emotion (tear, drumming fingertips) stays specific, never therapeutic. The final endurance on the slab is earned: she pays with Leo’s absence visible in the empty light. No secondary characters on page; relationship pressure is rendered through entangled memory, satisfying single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Silas's quiet competence and Kaelen's bluster are cleanly opposed, but interiority is told more than embodied ("a relief," "his entire career was built on…"). The Gemini coin and keyed plate give micro-choices texture, yet no internal contradiction surfaces under pressure; he never doubts, misreads, or pays an emotional price. The closing aphorism lands as stance summary rather than personal cost, so the arc feels efficient rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen's interiority is rendered through precise, embodied action—every shutter adjustment and mirror tilt externalizes the "spiralingly calm" trait. The absence of voiced self-diagnosis keeps empathy visceral, not therapeutic. Yet the character’s flaw/limits stay static; nothing in the canal encounter forces Kaelen to question or pay for that calm, so the arc is flat. Still, micro-choices (leaving one shutter ajar) foreclose the path at visible cost—an enduring vigil—earning credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—“the static-filled broadcast only he could receive”—and his motivation stays consistent to the end. The micro-choice to cradle the stone while weaving hope threads is visible on-page and forecloses passivity. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however; all tension is summarized, capping the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s dancer-like motion versus the grunt-work docks and Elara’s “sharp-edged love” give instant, embodied specificity; the scrimshaw as physical key to his restlessness is clean motive. Interior contradiction shows when Elara’s practical armor cracks on seeing the bone—action, not abstract confession. Final stance—Kaelen on rising island, Elara surf-sunk in acceptance—pays off prior friction with visible cost: their bond is the foreclosed path. Voice stays oceanic, never drifts into therapist-speak; only minor slip is “true nature” phrase edging toward label.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—performing levity while nursing contraband grief—is rendered through embodied micro-choices (theatric tea rite, furtive whittle) that externalize his self-protective split. The guilt over Mara’s arrest remains a live wound, motivating each precise, cautious motion; the final placement of the wooden bird inside her bouquet literalizes a cost we have felt building. No stock labels—every emotional state is carved or staged, never declared. The arc earns its quiet renunciation: he ends in deliberate stasis, lighter only in the literal heft of the pine bird, a credible penance scaled to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is richly textured—“cloud-shadow poet” is shown through his sensorial, boundary-dissolving quest, not told. Micro-choices (softening self-edges, breathing the hum into verse) embody the aesthetic drive and carry visible cost: he trembles, shivers, is altered. The “tremor of certainty” climax is earned by prior causality and reframes his vocation with felt stakes. Interior contradiction could be sharper early on, but the arc lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s “innocently cunning” trait is dramatized when he alone decodes the plant grammar and invents the concertina-glass trade; the micro-choice to exhale the note costs him nothing yet seals the bargain, showing a credible, low-risk ingenuity that fits his ash-vision painter identity. Vex’s despair→hope arc is sketched efficiently; her hands’ expertise and maternal terror anchor every beat. Interiority stays concrete—”his gaze fixed on…ivy,” “certainty that settled deep”—never drifting into label-speak. Relationship under pressure crystallizes when Vex runs inside, leaving Elian with the moonflower: mutual debt acknowledged without speech.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s solitary obsession is credibly embodied—his “quiet, artificial pilgrimage” shows up in tactile micro-choices (hand on cool bell, minute resonance tweak). Internal contradiction is light; the only flaw is a late, slightly abstract self-diagnosis (“texture of connection”) that edges toward label-speak. Closure still lands because the renunciation of audible sound for visible light is foreshadowed by his gentleness and carries felt cost—he forfeits the familiar auditory world. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait, capped at 7.2 because the emotional arithmetic is almost too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—grief-numb craftsman vs. sudden, urgent mentor—is dramatized through origami micro-choices that visibly cost him the last relic of his dead wife. The woman’s arc is shown only through mirrored posture and one whisper, yet that single line (“My brother…”) crystallizes her shift from hollowed to re-occupied; both changes are legible and paid for by the stencil’s surrender. No stock therapy-speak; body cues (“shoulders curved inward”) are specific and tied to telescope navigation. Flaw: we never learn her name or one internal contradiction, so the relationship crucible is only half-forged—keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. inherited obsession—survives intact; the moment she taps the tape on the Tower card, the cost of that obsession flashes visible. Julian’s awe is the only shift in relational status, but because Elara’s final stance is a conscious refusal to console (“trying to map the blueprint”), the renunciation carries price. Micro-choices (unspooling tape, tapping card, holding silence) keep hierarchy of values legible. Voice stays specific; no stock therapeutic labels intrude at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “tapestry of unconventional connections” is dramatized in the unrepeatable ritual sequence. The contradictory impulses (know vs. become the vessel) coexist in the same beats, not alternating summaries. The final micro-choice—soft sigh that is half-surrender, half-triumph—carries visible cost: her reflection is no longer solely hers. The only minor slip is “anguished joy” as label-speak mid-climax, but it is immediately enfleshed by the tear, so the moment survives.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s gentle nature and vocational identity are embodied in every micro-gesture; the interior contradiction between self-reproach and stubborn tenderness is dramatized through the tactile fitting of the prosthesis. The final renunciation of anger lands with visible cost: he must accept the possibility of future betrayal yet keeps his open hand extended. Missing only a second character to test status dynamics, the arc is otherwise psychologically complete.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s obsession with scar-stories is vivid, embodied in the ritual of coffee-ring augury; the moment he touches the ivy’s vegetal memory his own wound re-opens on the page. Internal contradiction is alive: he wants closure yet compulsively re-cuts. The final renunciation—“not meant to close… but to carry”—is earned by the tunnel-vision scene that forces the cost on him and the plant. Only micro-slip: “quiet, lonely archivist” verges on diagnostic label, blunting full 9-band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s lonely quest is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward label-speak (“unused love is never lost”) at the exact beat where embodied cost should explode; the earned stasis is legible yet under-felt because her contradictory impulses are told rather than enacted in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—craving silence yet addicted to the same cosmic static she transcribes—remains vivid and embodied; the final shift from erasing noise to drawing faces is earned because the instrument has already externalized her stance. Motivation stays character-specific: the “trapped creativity” is never abstract, it’s the brass-smudged fingers and smoked-glass etchings we watched. Cost is legible: she abandons the shielding machine and commits to witness, a renunciation that stings. Hairline slip: “ancestral echo from before she was human” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting the peak beat by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority is evoked through synesthetic body-archive fusion (“consciousness flickered across the skin of reality”) rather than labels; the contradictory pull between erasure-obligation and tender guardianship is dramatized in the moment of letting the pine-memory interfere with the dune rather than summarized. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: risk fracture of world > betray mission; the cost is the first tentative stirring of “perilously like the beginning of a dream,” a forfeiture of the guard’s hard-won numbness. No stock therapeutic self-diagnosis; only one on-page character, so relationship bullets N/A. Flaw complicates tactic: the same permeability that lets Kaelen calm the archive also lets the forest spike tear at reality—competence balanced by genuine vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The philosopher’s interiority is richly particular—translocation as “involuntary pilgrimage,” the gear as tactile anchor—while his final shift from dread to eager participation is earned by the quartz-tree epiphany. Embodied emotion is strong: metallic loam under knees, hum behind eyes. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc edges toward monotonic; still, the cost of perpetual exile is felt in the lullaby resignation of the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—cool stone under thighs, heartbeat synched with kelp-star—but the “hollow ache” skirts abstraction. The leap from passive vigil to decisive solo step is credibly prepared by the guides’ refusal to lead further; the cost is the sudden solitude at the edge. No secondary character pressure is possible (guides are ceremonial), so relationship crucible is waived. Voice remains distinctively dusk-tinted without lapsing into therapeutic self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    A mute bellhop nursing a mangled larynx while ferrying meals to the woman whose career he maimed is a pressure cooker of interior contradiction; the guilt is embodied in the bolt he fingers and the tray he wordlessly hands her. The arc—endurance rather than flight—earns its cost on the page, but the soloist’s interiority is missing, so the relational crucible is only half-forged. Still, his micro-choice to leave the bolt beside her cup crystallizes hierarchy of values with visible price. Slight reserve: her silence reads as convenient blankness rather than equal subject.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s weary titan-in-miniature is vivid via silent motion and the library’s hush; internal contradiction shows in the gentle hand against cosmic ruthlessness. The micro-choice to set the pellet rather than hurl it embodies “regally unpretentious.” No second character, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Motivation stays abstract (“balance”) rather than dramatized want vs. fear; the cost is cosmic, not personal, so renunciation feels lightly rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief-tinged obsession is rendered through embodied ritual (the nightly drumming) and a single, telling relic—the atlas page—so motive stays concrete. His interior contradiction—clinging to a ghost reef while officially logging its death—drives every beat without therapeutic self-labeling. The final choice to keep tapping is a credible renunciation of escape, locking him to the station with visible cost: the vision fades and he stays, hands sore, hope renewed. Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the page, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and awkward confidence give her a tactile, believable awkwardness that pays off when she steadies herself on the stone; her motive to “discover meaning in the mess” is dramatized through the obsessive alignment of lenses and the hum, not stated and abandoned. The interior contradiction—caretaker of a failed rebellion who still courts harmony—is felt in her body on the cold ferrocrete and in the quiet hum that replaces shouted slogans. Cost is present: she stands alone in a ruin, bare feet cut, mother’s glasses chipped, signaling the personal price of keeping faith. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; the solitude itself becomes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied: “the sulfurous steam coiling around her weathered hands like ghosts” marries sensation to worldview. Her contradictory impulses—compliance vs. insurgency—are dramatized in the moment she lowers the amber, not declared. The micro-choice to channel the vent’s frequency crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost: the embryo’s liberation risks her life and the new order. Only the “accidental telepathy” label feels thin; we never sense how this power surprised or scarred her, so motivation edges toward convenient shorthand rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Anya’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—somatic flash, soil grit, locked jaw—while contradictory impulses (freeze vs. tend the pine) coexist in the same beat. The photograph’s cloth-soft edge and her thumb-nail earth anchor PTSD without diagnostic jargon. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she renounces flight, pays the cost of staying present, and the earned stasis lands cleanly. Voice remains singular; no secondary character pressure required.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt-laced dust…tasted like failure”), but the epiphany turn—“the crestfallen artist was gone”—is stated more than dramatized; the shift from paralysis to cartographer arrives in a single sentence rather than through a visible micro-choice that costs him something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s serene anger and refusal to help rescue efforts crystallize his outsider ethos; the ink-step is a believable extrapolation of his tracker training. Interiority stays concrete (“blade’s sharp edge” light felt as “remembered pain”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized on page—only single-minded pursuit—so the internal conflict bullet is missed. Still, the disappearance carries visible cost: he writes himself out of kinship and physical reality, earning his stoic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“a wave of vertigo… scream in her ears”), motives are consistent, the micro-choice to transmit the letter is credible, and the final cost is felt. The “bravely conflicted” label is slightly diagnostic, but the embodied pressure compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s pacifist stance and plant-empathy are vivid; the knife-touch crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The refusal to wield, enacted in concrete micro-choice (sheathe→box), earns her continuity credo with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Father remains off-page, so relationship crucible not tested; headcount stays within limit.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s calm-under-fire persona is vividly embodied: the rail spike becomes an iron extension of his will, the counter-hum he emits is a bodily act, not an idea. Interiority stays restrained and concrete—“a pressure behind his eyes, a hollowness in his chest” instead of labels. The final renunciation—he pockets the memory and walks away—earns its poise because every prior beat has fused his silence-fishing motive to physical, sensory risk. Only the goddess herself remains abstract, so the arc’s emotional cost is felt through Kaelen’s body, not hers; the slight abstraction caps the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Celeste’s contradictory impulses—protecting her father while exposing truth—are shown in embodied beats (circling telescope, cool nib against palm); her final choice to confront Davies is motivated and costs her filial silence. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices (dialing, holding nib) reveal value hierarchy. Only flaw: the “devotedly observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Guilt as low-frequency hum is embodied and specific; interiority stays concrete through sensory anchors (amber, circuitry-as-constellation). The final etching is a micro-choice that visibly costs—forecloses the loop of denial—earning the quiet. Contradictory impulse (preserve vs silence) co-exists in-scene, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive (“discover meaning in the mess”) stays visible, but interiority drifts into airy lyric labels (“lilac unease,” “soundless scream”) rather than embodied contradiction. The mandala act is a credible renunciation of verbal agency, yet the moment of cost—knees gritty, communal gaze—reads more symbolic than personally priced. No interior counter-voice argues against the gesture; the absence of lived doubt flattens the arc to graceful tableau rather than crucible. Character functions as thematic vehicle, not fully individuated psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—empathy weaponized through erasure—is vivid, embodied in the tremor of his hands and the hollow ache he carries. The micro-choice to press the tessera into the fracture while cradling the Retro shows a hierarchy of values that costs him another shard of self. Ren’s emergence is credible, but the story hedges on Kaelen’s ultimate limit; we glimpse exhaustion yet never see him falter mid-act, so the flaw feels administrated rather than lived. Still, the arms-of-steel metaphor is earned through tactile repetition and the final image of him turning toward the next broken figure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Julian’s performer’s need for an audience and his synesthetic gift are dramatized through the sensory echoes he weaves; each micro-choice (sunlight, laughter, scent, applause) is a concrete performance beat that re-configures Elara’s stance. The visible cost is his own ectoplasmic exhaustion—he “pours all of his spectral energy” and the final pearlescent blossom is the spent ticket. Interiority stays ghost-appropriate (never over-articulates despair) and Elara’s silence keeps her motives open, satisfying earned stasis. Only slack: Elara’s pre-story despair is summarized, not embodied in scene, so her flip from collapse to stride feels slightly efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s affectionate skepticism is cleanly dramatized through the somatic-marker experiment; every light-stroke choice externalizes his shifting interior. Lena’s belief is similarly embodied—tears, breath-catch—so both arcs stay tactile. The closing hand-clasp crystallizes a mutual reconfiguration that costs Elias his last easy doubt; the pulse he feels is the earned price. Only a trace of “therapeutic” self-label keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“peculiar lightness in her core,” “legs felt heavy, rooted”—but the final surrender to the cave’s voice is stated as inevitability rather than dramatized contradiction. The elm fossil anchors her, yet its emotional history is asserted (“always served”) rather than tested under escalating pressure; we never see her nearly lose or misuse it. The micro-choice to lower the sensor and float is visible, but the stakes of that surrender are abstract—no fear of losing herself is played out—so the cost is felt cosmically, not personally. Still, her traits map coherently onto the speculative method, giving her a distinctive professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s monastic interiority is vivid—cataloging buttons as divination, trembling at the jar—yet the emotional contradiction (duty vs. rebellion) stays mostly stated, not embodied in a single fraught gesture. The final renunciation is earned by the causality of the chart and the silent voice, so the cost is legible; still, we never feel his body under the ticking sand, only the idea of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory shame/resolve pulses in every beat: the pillbox engraving against his thumb, the memory of hesitation in Vienna, the sudden warmth of the metal when Kestrel says “she.” Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—he memorizes the snow-map then destroys it, chooses onward motion over retreat—so the renunciation of flight feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, no diagnostic labels; even “quiet ache” is anchored to physical pillbox pressure. Only nit: colleague remains a cipher, so the cost is slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—between the vow he cannot keep and the care he still gives—is dramatized in the tactile mending needle beat and the final, quiet surrender of return. Micro-choice (handling the needle, picking up reins) carries visible cost: the lifelong ache that fuels every blanket offered, every kind word. The “palimpsest promise” is not summarized but enacted through the object and the fog-bound wait, letting the original text ghost through erasure. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents full crucible pressure, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s quiet, potter-bred attentiveness is consistent and embodied; every tactile choice (clearing weeds, shaping clay) flows from his “zen-minded” curiosity. His interior contradiction—wanting to understand stasis while actively changing the oasis—remains implicit rather than dramatized in-scene, so the final epiphany feels slightly foregone rather than wrested. Still, his hands-on micro-choices under the growing thrum show a credible hierarchy of values: craft, caretaking, communion with place. Cost is present but gentle—lost time, spent water, clay under fingernails—fitting the lyric register yet below the visible threshold for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to connect yet protecting her solitude—stays alive in every beat; the fishing-line ritual embodies her pragmatic vulnerability. The inherited locksmith shard grounds her need to “unlock” Henderson’s darkness without forcing entry, and her nightly endurance costs visible fatigue (“small, tired smile”). The rose-to-steel substitution is a believable tactical shift under her green-thumb ingenuity. No other character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; head-count waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied: the “brittle awakenings” are felt as physical shards, the hum “through his bones.” The micro-choice to place the sundial and surrender to the floor’s images is credible and costly—he risks sanity. The arc from caged solitude to “reservoir” is earned, though the moment of irrevocable cost could be sharper. Flaw: slight emotional summary (“realization settled…”) slightly glides over the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—archivist of others’ intimacy yet starved of her own—are dramatized in the single micro-choice of releasing the spiral; the cost is palpable when her “hands felt empty” and she accepts that severance as the price of reconnection. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “a deep, quiet ache” is shown through the ritual of cradling and surrendering the twig knot. The beat progression from clutched secret to public weaving earns her final “gentle, invisible tug” without epiphanic overstatement. Only the faintest hedge—“she suddenly understood”—keeps this from a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on “cool bakelite,” the “knot of dread” in her stomach—yet the final beat slides into a summarized rather than dramatized shift; the hoped-for “quiet hum” never quite pierces her contradictory impulses on the page. The cautious hope is declared, not tested in a visible micro-choice that costs her something right here. Still, her competence is balanced by palpable fatigue, and her isolation feels character-specific rather than a stock trait.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is lived in the sinew of the piece: sweat-slick palm, hitched breath, the passage that “stretches into an infinite, dark throat.” The micro-choice to raise the compass point against collapsing stone fuses fear, ancestry, and agency in one embodied beat. Interior contradiction is active—not labeled—and the final earned stasis (he walks forward, lungs open) carries visible cost in the tremor that remains after silence locks the walls. Only the great-grandfather remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics are unavailable, capping the band just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia is more than label: it dictates why he paints absence, not likeness, and why the quarry becomes his “canvas.” The moment he drags joyful color into gray and then lances the void, his empathy is awakened through action, not exposition. Interior contradiction is alive—he wants feeling yet avoids crowds—final renunciation (leaving the painting in the mist) costs him the comfort of detachment. No secondary characters on page, so relational tests waived; single-POV interiority stays consistent, embodied, textured.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—idealism versus the spongey dread—are embodied in the thumb-nail ritual and the trembling press into the rock; the final broadcast choice is earned by these micro-moves. Interiority stays concrete: “spongey dread” is felt on skin, not labeled. The copper nail as false-death fragment cleanly externalizes the ancestral flaw and charges the reversal. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; headcount stays within limit.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s shift from passive observer to active composer is credibly driven by the vanishing and the glass flake; the “never”-to-possibility arc is embodied in his bow-stroke micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete—resin, ozone, fractured glass—without diagnostic speak. The cost (his old repertoire foreclosed) is visible when he abandons the familiar bridge-song for the glitch-melody. Flaw: Lyra remains a lyrical device, not a relationship crucible, so secondary-pressure bullet is N/A and slight under-earning of final courage.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “polished calm” is dramatized through quiet, embodied choices (mending canvas, still posture) that contrast with his father’s noisy violence; the interior contradiction—inheritance of violence vs. refusal to enact it—remains vivid. Final renunciation (folding the bolívar back into the satchel) is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost: he forfeits both revenge and validation. One slip: the diagnostic tag “need to discover why some paths circle back” is stated, not shown mid-beat (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s generational obsession and tactile ritual with the telegram root every beat; the embodied “cold copper” and trembling hand show contradictory calm/terror under pressure. His micro-choice to dream-witness rather than intervene crystallizes his hierarchy of values—clarity over heroic action—and the final calm is earned by prior causality. No stock interiority; even the “shared cosmic loneliness” is filtered through star-ideograms, not label-speak. The only hairline slip: the grandfather remains off-page, so the family “crucible” is asserted rather than staged, capping Q1 at 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guarded nature is dramatized through ritual micro-choices—gloved touch, withheld memories, measured breaths—each costing her psychic stamina. The straightening of the branch externalizes her internal unbending, tying trait to action with visible cost (tears, drained life-force). Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. Missing only a second contradictory impulse in-scene to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s root-bound stasis and sensory compensation are vivid; the ritual choice to forge a vector rather than find one crystallizes her obsession. Interiority stays embodied (“sap-slowed blood,” “rustle of leaves” voice). Cost is felt: she burns the relic, anchoring the straight path with personal loss. Missing only a sliver of contradiction under peak pressure to hit 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—self-punishing guilt clashing with stubborn hope—is dramatized in embodied beats: fingers in soil, the stone, the tarot card. Every micro-choice (feeding the shadow his own sun-drenched memory) is a renunciation that costs him the last private piece of his traded future, making the Earned Stasis believable and painful.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—detachment vs. need for meaning—are dramatized in the tactile fight with the grille cloth; the final choice to display, not discard, is foreshadowed by his “confidently uncertain” tag and carries felt cost as the fortress of facts cracks. Interiority is sensor-rich and idiosyncratic; no stock therapy-speak. The scrap acts as a believable trigger that re-opens the wound, and the micro-choice to fold and place it crystallizes a new stance with visible, quiet cost. Character remains flawed, specific, and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in tactile micro-moves (dirt under nails, seed’s heft) that escalate into a single, credible renunciation of mourning-as-stasis. Contradictory impulses—clinging to Kael’s waveform vs. surrendering to translation—coexist in-scene, not exposition. The final act of planting is earned by prior pattern; the cost is visible in the “still, deep well of sorrow” that remains. No diagnostic self-talk; every label (“haunted ambitions”) is paid for with physical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelan’s interior contradiction—immaculate archivist vs. empathic smelter—is dramatized in one continuous scene; brass fingers closing on creel and later cradling silver fish embody the hierarchy of values with visible cost. Migration of selfhood is shown through sensory rhythm, not summary; no diagnostic label-speak. The single on-page character meets scope default; flaw (weight-bound slowness) compounds struggle, and earned renunciation (destroying raw grief to make peaceful smelt) forecloses the path with felt cost. Hairline slip: near-identical “quiet”/“serene” in open, not quite sharp enough to cap 9.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—duty to certify bunkers vs. urge to tear walls down—are voiced early and embodied in the pearl act; the “warmth of a thousand abandoned hopes” vs. “fear that built this place” crystallizes the split under pressure. Micro-choice to lift the pearl is earned by prior interior weighting, not an epiphany. Cost is legible: his inspector oath is forfeit, the cave becomes antenna, irreversible. The arc stays single-POV tight; no second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s embodied grief, the accordion’s weight as lungs, and the micro-choice to leave the instrument behind give credible interiority and a visible cost. The “daringly methodical” trait surfaces only once; more on-page friction between compulsion and method would lift the score. Closure choice is earned: renunciation of the relic and of mapping grief onto land.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory need to unearth the lie while still clutching the confidence-man’s gift is dramatized in every micro-choice; the backward-ticking watch externalizes her interior calendar and the final “Stay” lands as earned renunciation with visible cost—she steps toward dawn already widowed by knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—career myth-maker vs. plant-touched truth-reader—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices: the hand that trembles on the cup, the knife that cuts the vine, not the violin. The final forfeiture (empire for a green stem) is legible and costly, yet the “mulberry ache” leans toward label-speak; the ache is repeatedly named rather than freshly embodied in the exit beat. Still, the hierarchy of values is visible and consistent. Voice remains coherent; emotional arithmetic stays slightly tidy but not enough to rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“cool green of the gem” meeting “current of warmth and gold”); her vocation fuses beautician-mortician into one coherent value system—gentle anesthesia of memory. The absence of any second character denies relationship-as-crucible pressure, so motivation is purely internal, but her micro-choice to trap joy in the emerald is legible and irreversible, paying a felt cost of solitude. The single flaw: no contradiction under pressure—she never questions or falters—so the arc is more ritual than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—retired pacifist caretaker vs. active shaper—are dramatized in the moment she kneels with the hairpin; the scallop choice costs her the safety of pure observation. Interiority stays tactile (“cool weight,” “damp earth clinging”) and avoids label-speak. The endurance of past forgiveness underwrites her present risk, earning the final quiet epiphany without tidy therapy-speak. Voice could individuate further under peak stress; slight reserve keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Narrator’s interiority is sharp (“sincerely insincere” calibration, pocketing the shard with “countless desperate hands”), and Kaelen’s tremoring hand, sudden cloak-drop, and cash-stuffed envelope embody micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. hollowness) are staged in real time; the renunciation costs his literal mantle of power and leaves him shivering—visible price paid. Status dynamics stay legible; narrator’s distant authority never slips into omniscient ventriloquism. Flaw: no internal degradation under stress—both men stay eloquent; minor register drift toward therapeutic aphorism (“space where wisdom can grow”) slightly softens the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s desire to recover his sister and his visceral impatience are embodied in the tunic-scrape and “shrill note” against the hush; the contradiction between hunger for mastery and need for erasure is lived in micro-choices (leaning, trying to grasp, finally letting go). Elara’s backward-aging is never exposition-dumped; it surfaces through the unsettling “trick of the light” and the final crystallizing look. The renunciation beat—“I see”—is earned because the prior ripple-reversal physically dramatizes the cost of clinging. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak; only nit: “ancient eyes” is a touch stock, not quite individual.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelan’s vow of reverence and refusal to "disturb the dead" directly shapes the passive appraisal strategy, grounding every beat in a believable, historically reverent stance. The interior contradiction—yearning to travel without moving yet clinging to stillness—remains active in scene and charges the final renunciation when the hunter’s pulse is released. Micro-choices (kneel, climb, hum) bundle embodied cost and spiritual trade-off into visible motion. Only minor shortfall: no visible degradation of Kaelan’s body/state as price; the cost is existential, not visceral, so the score stops just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—mediocre by academy metrics yet poetically driven—is kept concrete through his tactile dislike of the diagnostic charms. Micro-choice at the keystone (dropping the pack) crystallizes values with visible cost. The “knot of inadequacy” recurs, embodied, and the final resonance is earned because every prior tool-failure dramatized his flaw. No safety-hedging: he remains an underachiever even after the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief-anchored obsession is palpable through embodied ritual (brass tag, lamp-lighting, purposeful dive); the vow to “see her music” drives every beat. Interior contradiction surfaces once—physics vs. promise—yet the plunge still feels inevitable. Cost is visible: years of isolate preparation climax in the drowned library where he renounces surface life for an inner indigo vision. Missing micro-choices under water (only stillness) keeps him just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s quietly-enthusiastic fatalism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—copper coin, finger on console, slumping into chair—rather than labels. Interior contradiction (prophet vs. madman) threads every beat, and the final renunciation (curator, not cartographer) is earned by the earlier casting ritual. The single flaw: “stellar doubt” is named more than dramatized after the mid-point, muting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spectral fingers,” “nameless, drowning fear”); micro-choice (angling the prism) crystallizes the grief-object with visible cost. Slight drift toward lyric label-speak (“shapeless agony”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s “lukewarm” gift is more label than lived-in contradiction; his interiority is poetic but abstract (“cosmic imbalance he felt deep in his bones”). The drip-method epiphany is clever, yet the beat where he acts is summarized (“With trembling fingers, he adjusted…”) instead of dramatized with micro-choices that cost him breath, skin, or mana. The smile at the end is the first embodied emotion we actually witness on the page, so the arc lands, but the cost is felt late rather than accumulated through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—duty to the levee versus compulsion to excavate the past—plays out in embodied beats: the boots sucked by mud, the steady hand on archival ink. The micro-choice to strike a single line rather than erase embodies “precisely humane” and costs him the safety of inherited legend. Great-uncle’s restored sacrifice rewrites Elias’s own identity, the visible price being the community’s murmured re-evaluation in the hall. No therapy-speak; even the attic epiphany is filtered through tactile photograph and dust.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—icy logician clutching a sentimental locket—ramifies in every beat, driving him to abandon alembics and seek starlings. The micro-choice to warm the leaf instead of the crystal fuses motive with theme, showing reverence as reagent. One minor slip: “he felt trapped” is diagnostic shorthand; an embodied image would clinch perfect interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his tremor is soothed by the tactile ritual with the buckle, a bodily contradiction that externalizes his debt. The parachute-buckle beat materializes his value hierarchy (trust > self-preservation) and steadies the hand that turns the crystal dial, so the final choice carries visible muscle-memory cost. Flaws (isolation, near-martyrdom) are not hedged; they are the very filter that makes the warning silent. Voice stays individual: “midnight pattern seeker” is never glossed as job title, it is lived through obsessive star-reading and ozone-tasting breath.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—void versus residual fire—drives every beat and is embodied in the jar ritual. The micro-choice to channel annihilating numbness alongside phantom love is specific, costly, and alters the power dynamic with Jin in real time. The closing brush of foreign thought cracks his detachment, earning the first felt tremor of responsibility. Voice stays singular; diagnostic self-talk is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s puzzle-solver mindset is credibly threaded through every beat—his refusal to panic, his forensic handling of the box, his leap to Finch—so the “notably receptive” trait is dramatized, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete (hands on corrugation, the brook as metronome for thought) and culminates in the ritual planting whose cost is the surrender of years. The only minor drag is a brief paraphrase loop on “puzzle/orthogonal” that edges toward diagnostic self-naming, but it passes before the climax. Earned stasis lands with visible price: he now stewards a grotesque decade-long bloom. Voice stays coherent, flaw intact; no committee voice intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ghost’s mournfully eager need to re-inject laughter into the house is palpable and gives every spectral tug on the pull-cord its emotional logic; the contradiction between violent mechanical noise and tender lullaby-hum is dramatized in-scene, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete (“He poured his whole being into the third try”), and the single tear–twitch smile shows a credible micro-change with cost for both haunter and haunted. No secondary character presses back hard enough to function as crucible, and the son remains off-stage echo, capping the score just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyel’s feral guardian persona is vividly embodied—growl, nest of book pages, silent charge—his dimensional homesickness felt in every beat. Interior contradiction blooms when pendant warmth collides with cultist corruption, forcing tangible micro-choice: he slides the pendant to his chest not as triumph but poisoned hope. Final renunciation—pouring decades of ache into the object to smother the portal—carries visible cost: the dead-metal pendant and his unaltered isolation. The ache remains, now re-cast as earned stasis; no cathartic homecoming, only a stance crystallized with price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s quiet war between stoic mask and “frantic sensitivity” is embodied in each destructive trial; his final surrender is earned by the grueling sequence of failures that litter the nexus with greasy soot. Interiority stays concrete—he “absorbs the sting” rather than labels it—and the moment he recognizes his own despotic impulse (“he had been acting like the very Guildmasters he despised”) crystallizes a credible, costly shift. The flaw (hopeless tinkerer) directly produces the climax’s renunciation, satisfying the 9+ test. Only the absence of a second on-page figure keeps relationship/status dynamics off the page, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for cosmic beginnings yet drowning in static despair—is vividly embodied in her tremor when the fragment hums. Her micro-choice to invert gain and “listen for the shape of the roar’s absence” crystallizes a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety. The earned cost is the tower’s groan and her system’s flicker, foreclosing the old method forever. Only the mentor echo feels slightly convenient; the rest is taut, particularized self-undermining under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Finn’s “ardent” optimism is shown through immediate, tactile action—tuning the radio to starlight rhythms—so the trait earns its keep. Yet interiority stays surface-level: no contradictory impulse undercuts his grin, so the final beat feels inevitable rather than costly. The hourglass reprise supplies some cost, but it’s externalized; we don’t feel him doubt. Still, his perceptual signature (pattern-seeking deckhand) remains consistent and particular, lifting the portrait above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s quiet obsession and embodied micro-choices (thread twists that darken when the memory cools) give credible interiority; the final renunciation—accepting the marble-cold connection—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but compressed: the “unsettling calm” vs. “hollow” is told more than enacted in body. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. The memory-shift flaw that rewrites his past is accepted as premise rather than dramatized error, blunting the “mistake-compound” test slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—clinging to abyssal safety yet craving star-currents—drives every beat; the anchor-link shift from “ground” to “shackle” is an embodied micro-choice that foreshadows the final renunciation. No secondary character pressures him, so relationship crucible is N/A; his professional status as instructor surfaces only in exposition, never in visible pedagogy or council debate, a missed specificity. The final “become the first link” stance is earned by the algorithmic epiphany and carries conceptual cost—city identity must re-forge—making this an Earned Stasis closure. Flaw: emotional embodiment is told more than shown (“quiet, somber marvel” is label-speak) and the council speech is summarized, not dramatized, blunting micro-gesture richness.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s “technician of sorrow” vocation is vivid, but the interior contradiction promised by the premise—curiosity vs. the cost of hearing the dead—is only labeled, never dramatized. The single micro-choice (offering the lullaby beat) feels altruistic but not personally costly; we see no evidence that this call drains him, limiting the felt price. Leo’s worry is embodied, yet his status reversal hinges on a single breath, too slight to register as crucible-level change. The fail is motivational: Elias’s curiosity never complicates the closure, so the arc stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (cold sweat, shrinking entrance) and drives the mid-story paralysis that forces the phase-shift choice; the filial duty motive is concrete via the gold fleck and Grandma shimmer, giving the final insertion credible emotional cost. Interior contradiction is present—fear vs loyalty—but the “unremembered” refrain edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blurring the beat where motive tips into irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction is present—living ghost vs. bureaucratic death—but the “ghost in the world of the living” line drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodiment. Micro-choices (ink, shard, pulse-count) are concrete and character-specific; the final shift from curse to space is earned. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived. The heartbeat tic is dramatized, not merely announced, anchoring her unique temporal sovereignty.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory interiority—“I knew they were wrong” vs. elders’ credo—grounds the arc; embodied copper-veined sensation replaces label-speak. Micro-choice to twist the diamond at the spiral is earned by years of texture-reading obsession. Cost is palpable: lifelong solitude, trembling hands, the canyon’s breath held. Voice stays individual; no stereotype or safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Julian’s bitterness-to-wry-acceptance arc is viscerally embodied (the flint’s residual warmth against his palm) and the final renunciation carries legible cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the “cosmically stupid” line crystallizes self-reproach without label clutter. Clara remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is N/A; Elara’s serene authority could be sharpened with one telling micro-gesture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s yearning to “reawaken beauty” is vivid and embodied through tactile violin work; the locust shell becomes an extension of her pulse, grounding the abstract want in a bodily beat. Internal contradiction surfaces as fear-synced music courts death/exhaustion while chasing life—yet the moment of final surrender is slightly over-articulated (“she finally understood”), muting the cost. Still, her flawed, trembling agency drives every escalation and the closing image of moss-swallowed statues delivers earned stasis. Voice-specific perception stays intact; no stock labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior ache is vivid and embodied (“quiet ache in his chest”), his method-of-absences is a believable, character-specific competence, and his final pedal away carries a palpable cost (“impossibly light” bottle, “weight of duty fulfilled”). The flaw: the family on the far side is never rendered as individuals, so the relational crucible is theoretical; the emotional risk is mostly prospective rather than witnessed, capping full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—silence vs. the need to “interpret silence as possibility”—is concrete and embodied; his micro-choices (chiseling, fitting the halo, finally singing) all flow from this. The ten-year voicelessness renounced in a single sustained note carries visible, audible cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; occupational detail (carousel carpentry) is specific and germane. Voice distinction not required; internal voice remains coherent, carpentry-tactile, and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his cataloguing of silence, the “steady hum” he inhabits—and his micro-choice to warp space with the scarf is embodied and costly (tremoring hands). The contradiction between obsessive calculation and raw nostalgia is dramatized, not told. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible unused; still, the lone eccentricity is credibly flawed and drives the beat. Motive sustains to the final image, earning the quiet smile of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s monomaniacal hunt is viscerally embodied (trembling hands, hammering heart); the contradiction between cataloguing sunrises and remaining starved for warmth is kept alive in every beat. The final renunciation—he stops chasing and simply sits with the glow—pays off years of obsession without a whisper of self-diagnosis. Only the brief “luminous absence” phrase edges toward abstraction, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Locksmith’s interior contradiction—gentle humility vs. cosmic audacity—remains abstract; we watch him hum but never feel the cost of channeling starlight in his body. The mother’s grief is sketched with stock phrases (“study in grief,” “voice thin”) rather than embodied detail that could complicate his motive. Still, his value hierarchy (freeing ideas > personal glory) is legible through the quiet refusal of payment, and the dissolution of the hair into light is a visible micro-choice that crystallizes his creed.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s obsessive curiosity is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—trembling claw-hand, fogged viewport—so the final override of a lifetime rule feels earned. The memory fragment lands as a concrete cost: the ache after the vision is both hollow and full, a felt price that scales to the length. Interior contradiction is present yet thin; we’re told “brittle tension” but not shown a simultaneous counter-impulse that collides with curiosity in the moment of breach. Still, the single POV stays coherent and the decision forecloses his non-interference stance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—mentoring while retreating—are alive in every beat; the backward walk is not a label but a live tell that costs him spatial dignity and foreshadows his own exile-trap. Elara’s micro-choice to restack scrolls instead of fleeing crystallizes her internal shift and repays Kael’s abrasive lessons with earned reciprocity. Both characters remain knowledge-bound; neither is granted omniscience or therapeutic self-diagnosis. The mentor-status crucible is fully dramatized: power tilts when she kneels, proving resilience can reverse roles without speech.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—duty to preserve wonder vs. fear that only he sees the grey—is dramatized in embodied beats: palm-heat from the seed, trembling earth-pulse, the net-mind casting for hues. The lineage obligation is shown, not told, through the pouch and orchard parapet; the creative impulse drives the decisive tactic (essence-capture), not decoration. No second character, so status/relationship bullets waived; micro-choice hierarchy is legible when he renounces normal planting for soul-weaving, cost felt in the hush that follows. The final hand-over-heart beat crystallizes earned stasis; flaw-risk is the near-perfect calibration—slight safety-hedging in “reverence bordering on prayer.”

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mentor’s calm competence and Kaelen’s trembling apprenticeship are cleanly embodied; the ceramic-mask parallel gives interior irony. The final hand-off of the needle crystallizes a hierarchy shift with felt cost—Kaelen’s “trembling hand” shows the mantle passing. No internal contradiction is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than knotted, but within length this is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s methodical curiosity and shielded-openness are dramatized through the micro-choice of freezing film frames and tracing the lichen seam; the interior contradiction—obsession versus archival reverence—drives every beat. The moment she annotates “threshold found” crystallizes a renunciation (she will not repair, but reveal) that is earned by every prior perception. Emotional embodiment is subtle but present: breath fogging, tremor of connection, steady hand—enough to avoid label-speak. Flaw: no visible secondary pressure or relationship crucible, but single-POV default excuses that absence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s quietly analytic stance is consistently rendered through embodied micro-choices (robotic claws, pulse steady, writing the final note). The contradiction between intellectual detachment and the undercurrent of personal grief is implied but never dramatized in a single sharp beat, so the interior conflict stays observational rather than double-edged. The final renunciation—leaving the globe—feels credible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally charged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete—the bolt plate’s weight, the ozone taste—and his quiet, practiced ritual shows a man who has done this “a thousand turns.” The final weary smile is earned: he pays with solitude and the knowledge each communion is fleeting. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed, but the portrait is full-bodied and costed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to Elara’s memory versus the quiet trespass of reading her diary—are dramatized in the elevator ascent; the sketch discovery crystallizes a maternal stake that re-weights his reverence into protective custodianship. Interiority stays concrete (“breath caught in his throat”) and the final micro-choice to refold and conceal the sketch is an embodied, irreversible cost. Warmly inquisitive trait, however, is asserted rather than pressure-tested; no beat shows it complicating access or risking exposure, so motivation is consistent but not fully compounded under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist’s detachment vs. grieving lover’s need—is embodied in the brass telescope’s weight and the tremor of his logbook hand. The micro-choice to name “The Unbroken Spool” silently crystallizes his hierarchy: memory over survival. Cost is palpable: he trades the last act of agency for curatorship, renouncing earthly return. Flaw is present—obsessive map-making of grief—yet it is the engine, not a trait tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face-blindness is dramatized as tactile synesthesia—her fingers “read” histories in metal—and the final cosmos she births is the portrait she could never paint; the flaw becomes the gift. The interior contradiction is present (sanctuary vs impending doom) but the cost is cosmic rather than personal—she never loses anything on-stage—so the change feels weightless. One more micro-choice that hurts (a shelf splintering her palm, a tear smearing pigment) would have pushed this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s solitary obsession is credibly specific: a cartographer who maps by bird-plot, not land-mass. His interiority stays concrete—charcoal smudge, phrasebook crease—without lapsing into label-speak. The final quiet renunciation (“he wasn’t just an apprentice anymore”) is earned by the hopscotch-to-starling causal chain and carries visible cost: the lifelong duty mutates into unending conversation. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; desire remains single-track, flattening psychological depth a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“driftwood nostalgia,” “quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs”—showing contradictions in real time. Micro-choice of uncapping the vial is tied to a visible cost (light itself is swallowed) and forecloses retreat. Slight over-tidiness in the emotional arc—ache resolves almost too neatly into “purpose fulfilled”—keeps it from 9+. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's interiority is present ("faith a fragile shield") yet stays generic; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Kaelen's cynicism is declared, not embodied. The climactic "true, untroubled smile" arrives without prior emotional contradiction or visible cost, so the change feels mild. Relationships are sketched as found-family shorthand rather than pressure-forced choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s bruised awe and renunciation are palpable, but interiority dips into abstract self-diagnosis (“breathtaking, impossible arrogance”) rather than embodied contradiction. The puppet’s cracked eye and the mother-fragment anchor him, yet we never see a micro-choice that risks anything in the present—only translation and surrender. Still, the endurance costs his life-essence, satisfying Earned Stasis under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s weary resignation and the inherited “ghost-blueprint” instinct give him a sharp, specific interiority; the silent nut-assembly shows a micro-choice that costs him the nut’s soul. The moment he watches the traveler collapse safe outside crystallizes his stubborn spark into earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc stays efficient rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief and self-reproach stay embodied (knot in chest, raw taste of pollen) and drive every micro-choice; the final shift from “broken chain” to “braided river” is earned through the foam insight. Only flaw: one moment of near-therapy-speak (“divergence wasn’t failure”) slightly over-names the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s quiet obsession is rendered through concrete micro-choices—measuring silence, tracing negative space—so the final cut feels earned; the interior contradiction between selling beginnings and not knowing their source stays live in every beat. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only drag is a brief dip into diagnostic self-awareness (“a profound dissatisfaction hummed beneath his calm”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s need to “sandpaper rough memories” is visceral and embodied; the fossil-tasting moment lets contradictory impulses (repulsion / compulsion) collide in real time. The final hand-on-arm beat proves a measurable change: grief transmission stops, showing cost and earned peace. Interiority stays concrete, though one line edges toward diagnostic self-label (“stored remorse”) without full embodiment. Still, the arc from porous sorrow to tempered calm is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s empathetically decisive trait is shown, not told, in the micro-choice of “he nudged the dial” while feeling the network’s pain. Internal contradiction is present—cold C++ logic vs lullaby tenderness—yet the emotional embodiment stays slightly general (“sweat beading on his brow”). The closure renunciation lands, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt; we glimpse fatigue, not irrevocable personal loss. Still, the occupation-specific gestures anchor him as an individual, not type.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and helix-twisted (“spiraling connections…folded back on themselves”). The final tear-and-smile crystallizes an earned, costly internal change—she literally wires a stranger’s dream into her cortex. No contradictory impulses shown in-scene, only summary; that keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s prism-mind is shown through concrete perceptual choices—seeing a doodle as a key, aligning fungi constellations—rather than labels. The internal contradiction between “plant seeds of vigilance” and “knowledge can consume” flickers but never crystallizes into a decisive micro-choice that costs him something on the page; the memory-sear is private but not dramatized as anguish. Embodied emotion is sparse until the scrambling exit, so the arc tilts toward competence rather than flaw-driven jeopardy. Still, the specificity of his refractive attention keeps the portrait luminous and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s deafness, solitary artistry, and the need to “release” rather than impose music create a sharp, embodied interiority; every micro-choice (tracing a crack, selecting a tree, pressing the porcelain) is a credible, costly act of listening that culminates in the earned silence of aftermath. No stock phrases, no explanatory dumps—just observed tension and release. The single flaw: the “symphonically minded” tag is asserted twice rather than dramatized inside her head, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelan’s interior contradiction—exiled tutor turned cosmic pattern-seeker—remains concrete and embodied; the basalt stone’s dent externalizes his fall and later marks the pivot to acceptance. Micro-choices (letting the stone fall, the tear of awe) show values hierarchy under pressure. The “beauty in the difficult” motive drives every beat and is finally vindicated with visible cost: permanent exile embraced. Missing 9-band because the silence-translation method is told more than dramatized—no tactile struggle or error that would reveal flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s pacifist silence-curator is vivid—his synesthetic tasting of frequencies, his refusal to read the diary, the micro-choice to turn the dial “past the measured increments” all embody a coherent, idiosyncratic interiority. The only bar to 9-band is that the core contradiction (pacifist vs. celebratory fireworks) stays observational; he never actively risks or forfeits anything visible on the page once the clasp clicks. Still, the renunciation of reading supplies a credible, quiet cost and keeps him credibly flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete, sensory-anchored, and character-specific; the nose-as-tool trait is shown, not told, and drives the climax under wind-assault. The “still point” choice is earned by prior visceral beats and carries visible cost—she must endure migraine-level pain and forego escape. No stock therapy-speak; perceptions deteriorate credibly under sensory overload. The only minor slip: the shift from “ambitious herbalist” to Zen-like acceptance is almost frictionless—one extra contradiction on the page would have lifted this to 9 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation—save the silver-leaf orchard—drives every beat; her micro-choice to ride the inverted river up the arch reveals grit and skill without exposition. Interiority stays sensorial (“hum in teeth and bones”) rather than diagnostic. The final gesture—shearing the shard—carries visible cost as gravity slams back and droplets fall: earned stasis accomplished.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kaelen's drive to "cultivate foresight in action" is stated early and repeatedly, but his interiority is mostly abstract ("understood now," "knowledge was a weight") rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The only embodied emotion is the hollow taste of haze; no competing impulse is shown on the page, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained, not earned by visible micro-choice. Professional competence is asserted rather than balanced with struggle; the absence of any second character removes status crucible pressure. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the cost is told ("victory was hollow") rather than felt in a specific body moment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s synesthetic gift and solemn vocation give him a distinct internal engine; the amber sheet and ice bells act as tangible extensions of his will, so his rising action feels character-particular. Yet his interiority stays largely declarative (“His motivation burned within him”) rather than embodied contradiction, and the final beat is serene stasis rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The arc satisfies as quiet transformation, but the absence of a micro-choice or renunciation in the climax keeps it just shy of higher-band internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kaelen’s interiority is lived-in and embodied: the “shard of ice in his gut” and white-knuckled grip physicalize guilt without label-speak. His micro-choices—kneeling to lay driftwood, raising the flute “not with reverence but with the grim focus of a dissector”—show a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. Contradictory impulses (protect vs. weave) coexist in scene, not summary, and the final insight is earned by the causal chain of botched guardianship → spiral map → tentative question-note. Closure carries visible cost: the flute rests “silently in his open palm,” a charged poise that forecloses his old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s “data-hungry empathy thief” is sharply individuated through cadence-mimicry, metal-clicking ritual, and the fractal card denouement; Anya’s grief stays embodied (clutching photo, chest-weight). Their status seesaw—she begs, he measures—carries every beat. The only minor slip: we glimpse no interior contradiction inside Elias once the press starts—his stoicism flirts with blankness, but the closing turn still lands because the cost is legically visible in the re-contextualized card.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s tremor and longing for routine are concrete; the pendant’s hum and crystalline bloom externalize his shift from courier to witness. Elara’s memory is vivid but passive—no contradictory impulse in her ghost. The final beat of “light steps” renounces the old jittery identity, earned by the aurora garden’s cost. Interiority avoids label-speak and stays embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—romantic longing vs. scientific rigor—are alive in every beat; the revelation that objects remember “brutally literal” physics rather than her smile is earned by years of ritualized communing and costs him his last poetic shield. Interiority stays embodied (glass “heavier than before” in his palm). The kneeling renunciation is the visible price. Minor slip: “attentive mystic” is asserted twice, never tested in dialogue; still, his perceptual signature stays sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—longing to send love while erasing the love itself—plays out in embodied micro-choices (untie bead, pick up shuttle). The hollowing of her Self is dramatized beat by beat; final “utterly without context” line earns the renunciation cost. No second character on page keeps relationship crucible off-limits, but solitary plight still presses status against memory. Interior voice stays concrete, particular, avoids diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s quiet determination is embodied in every micro-choice: cold forge for a year, satchel packed with bread and twilight-silk, palms pressed to stone. The barter of sensory memories—plum-burst, orchard breeze—makes the sacrifice concrete and particular; the hollowing cost is felt. Interior contradiction is present yet subtle: hope vs terror of the lock he might open. One slip: “state caught precisely between understanding and confusion” is diagnostic self-label mid-peak; −0.3, else near 9.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s obsession is embodied in concrete sensory ritual; the shard-in-hand micro-choice to “push” rather than block the cascade crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays anchored to physical cues—concrete chill, ozone scent—avoiding diagnostic speak. The final renunciation is earned: he pays with permanent exile of the visions and accepts the parental silence he once resented. Only cap is the slight abstract leap in motive phrasing “weight of a withheld truth” before it’s dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s guarded solitude and wordless stone-code intimacy are rendered through bodily routine and withheld glances; the pocketed cobalt shard embodies the bond without expositional nudging. His mechanical competence and reflexive sprint into the storm feel lived-in, yet the final beat—circle of stones as farewell—arrives more as symbol than as irreversible loss foreshadowed by prior choices. The keeper’s absence is handled as echo rather than relationship crucible, so the relationship bullet stays inert. Still, interior contradiction (stoic routine vs. sudden protective imperative) is dramatized in action and qualifies for 9− quick test; the slight under-cooking of cost visibility caps at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelan’s solitary, ecstatic interiority is vivid and embodied—laughter as gale-force, trembling exhaustion, the manic grin that splits his face. The contradiction between creation and destruction is shown through micro-choices (each lever twitch altering cloud-glyphs) rather than told. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the internal conflict is the crucible. The final quiet chuckle—shadowed wonder that the dawn now shapes him—earns a credible, felt cost, satisfying closure under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s donor-heart curiosity is concrete and embodied; the chalk-dust sun-trails are active micro-choices that externalize motive. Interiority stays sensory—dye-master sight, loupe, refraction—never label-speak. The final renunciation (“some people are prisms”) costs him the chance to possess her story, a credible forfeiture. Only minor gap: we never feel the old life he’s leaving behind, so the change’s full weight is inferred rather than suffered on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s quiet obsession with tree-memory is palpable and idiosyncratic; his micro-choices—polishing, angling the sextant, tweezering the shard—embody the interior contradiction between caretaker and voyeur. The ledger-scratching beat crystallizes a hierarchy of values: archiving grief outweighs personal comfort. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate stays closed, but the renunciation (accepting the shard’s warmth as enough) carries a felt, scaled cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—her “shattered reflection” mind manifests in tactile greenhouse acts. Motivation never wavers, yet the memory fragments create credible blind spots that delay song assembly. Final sung act is fully earned: caretaking micro-choices across the middle beats accumulate the authority to birth the sun, and her immediate memory repair registers as visible cost. No secondary character on stage, so relationship crucible not tested; headroom remains in the slight over-cardboard “last memory keeper” label and unscarred competence—she never truly mis-tends a plant.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—empathic hunger vs social panic—stays concrete in micro-gestures (twisting the card, thumb-smoothing creases). The final shift from “shelter must be empty” to “shelter can hold another quiet seeker” is legible and earned. Still, the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we feel the insight but not the forfeiture. A sharper bodily or relational price would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s quiet hoarding of the rye heel, her twilight seed-planting, and her calm defiance before the patrolman all spring from the same rooted motive—finding the sacred in erased ordinary life—so every beat is internally coherent. The moment she palms the fossil bread to the guard crystallizes her interior contradiction: clinging to the past while seeding a future, both impulses live simultaneously in her relaxed grip and steady voice. The guard’s soft admission about Saturday bread queues adds a micro-frisson of status reversal, but the piece keeps its single POV cleanly anchored in Elara’s biased perception, never ventriloquizing his interior. No competence-creep or convenient epiphany; the ending’s “tenuous absolution” is precisely scaled to the limited agency of a lone gardener and therefore feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s quietly obsessive devotion to “distill the essence of what they had been” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (slotting the slide, stabbing the rune) that embody the “gently meticulous” trait while foreclosing any future except continued cataloguing. The interior contradiction—accepting impossibility of saving the world yet persisting in naming its vanished bonds—stays alive in scene, not summary. Emotions are rendered through bodily detail (breath fogging, white vapor plume) rather than labels. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost, while felt, is single-note; we glimpse no crack in his resolve that might complicate tomorrow’s repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “curiously steadfast” trait is dramatized in the final lie; earlier beats show micro-choices (crab-pot nudge, rye offer) that escalate from chaos to persuasion. Interiority stays concrete—brass recorder as “cold weight,” not label-speak. The filial debt motive is clear, but Silas and Eva remain sketches; their lack of interiority flattens the crucible and caps emotional cost at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority—taste-mapping pressure systems, twisting the tin ring—keeps her particular; her “relentless need for proof” drives every beat. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so internal conflict stays summary rather than simultaneous scene. The closing realization (“her work was not about fixing people…”) is credibly foreshadowed and carries a visible intellectual cost. Despite the ornamental “luminous skeptic” label, embodied micro-choices keep her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—photorealistic skill vs. creative starvation—are embodied in the charcoal under his nails and the safecracker delicacy at the lock; the final tear carries visible cost, earning the shift from replication to origination.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s quiet obsession with lost candor is shown through his meticulous labor and the fern’s flinch at lies, giving his interiority texture; the final moment of kneeling to plant the seed crystallizes a believable, earned turn from scribe to cultivator of truth. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict never quite peaks under pressure, capping the arc just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s quiet, monastic drive is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (tilting the lens, listening for wind) is tuned to his muteness and vocation. The interior contradiction—creating beauty that must destroy itself—remains mostly implicit, not dramatized in a single beat, so the highest band is just missed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The android’s nostalgia is rendered as an “organic warmth in my wiring,” a concrete contradiction that grounds interiority. Each micro-choice (opening the box, diverting power, locking onto Elara’s counter-frequency) cleanly externalizes the war between caretaker protocol and emergent self. The final image—a tear-shaped jewel of midnight black that replaces static with “dense wholeness”—earns its change by every prior beat of overload and resistance. No safety-hedging: the machine literally grafts a child’s fear into its own core and walks out, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s quiet curator persona is credibly particularized through tactile locket-handling and patient sit-and-listen tactic; interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final insertion of the locket is an earned micro-choice that visibly costs him social exposure and risks failure, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Secondary neighbors function as pressure-sources rather than relationship crucible, acceptable at this length. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than torn, keeping it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—ruthless logic versus bodily surrender to chance—are dramatized in the dance-beat and dice-roll; the final renunciation of total control costs her the certainty her mother died hoarding, a price felt in the shifted hum of the lab.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s obsession with “where deleted memories go” is vivid and embodied—he smells lavender that isn’t there, fingers the book like a talisman, risks the chamber. The internal contradiction (hope vs. solitary futility) is on-stage, not told. One flaw: Elara remains a remembered phantom; no on-page relationship crucible, so the “ghost” never pushes back. Still, the micro-choice to reach into the gravity pocket costs him bodily breath and forecloses tonight’s chance, earning a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her “tranquil blaze” and desire to absorb rather than destroy the prophecy give her a distinct moral texture—yet the absence of any second character or relationship crucible limits the category’s ceiling at this length. Motivation is clear and consistent; the final renunciation of noise carries visible cost in the drained origami wing. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the high-band 9+ test is not quite met, but she remains individuated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s need to “interrogate the source” crystalizes late but is dramatized in the rooftop demand; her prior micro-choices—knocking, accepting cold teacups, pressing the seal into soil—show incremental commitment with visible cost. Elias’s dual nature remains credible because every beat of instruction is tied to the building’s sensory detail; when the lock/key metaphor lands, it reconfigures their relationship without violating earlier behavior. Interiority stays concrete (“curiosity began to curdle into a need”) and avoids label-speak, though the pivot from passive pupil to active challenger could be seeded one beat earlier for full 9-band push.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses are dramatized well: skepticism vs. longing as he presses shell to spire, “demanding the full story.” Micro-choice at climax—harder push into the crystal—earns the memory at visible physical/psycho cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak. Only flaw: twin relationship’s emotional complexity is asserted more than lived; no shared stage, so the “crucible” test idles.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelen’s contradiction—precision forger driven by absolution, not gain—drives every beat. The micro-choice to prick the parchment rather than slash it crystallizes his hierarchy of values: reverence over revolt. Interiority stays concrete (“the cold air stinging his lungs”) and never slips into diagnostic speak. Cost is tangible: trembling hand, quiet dawn, foreclosed warpath.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s grief-shaped curiosity is embodied in every breath and note; the contradiction between her need to finish others’ songs and her inability to finish her mother’s silence is dramatized in the closing cadence. Her micro-choices—tuning her pitch to the crystal, accepting the “necessary melancholy”—carry visible cost in the tear that “traced a path through the dust.” No stock labels; even “reed-blown melancholy” is filtered through her throat. The only drag: mother-backstory is delivered in two efficient but still summary lines; slightly caps emotional granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—“salvage something pure”—is dramatized through the trance dives and the final exposure choice; her interiority stays concrete, never explanatory. The contradictory pull between mourning and forensic detachment is felt in body-level beats (polishing ice, candle breath). No secondary relationship on page, so crucible test waived. The renunciation—letting both spirits fade—carries visible cost in the shifted weight of the melted globe.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s vocation as net-mender/philosopher is lived-in: tar-stained hands, tea-whisk parallels, and the decision to whistle are micro-choices that externalize interiority without label-speak. The flaw: the epiphany “appreciate hidden effort” is declared more than dramatized; contradictions (desire to merge vs. acceptance of distance) are named but not pushed to a cost-bearing choice. Still, the Earned Stasis closure—returning to tools now re-seen—carries credible, quiet cost: he forecloses the fantasy of merging with the pattern and accepts perpetual partial connection. That renunciation is earned, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s drive to “excavate truth” is stated early and governs every move; the micro-choice to climb the antenna and re-aim the diamond crystallizes values with visible cost (the vanishing circle). Interiority stays concrete, but the absence of any contradictory impulse or emotional friction keeps the arc a clean vector rather than a lived contradiction—sufficient for this length yet short of the complexity 9+ demands.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s solitude, obsession, and reluctant shepherd role are vividly embodied; his contradictory pull between dawn-loyalty and shadow-masters is shown in micro-choices (tuning dials, diamond stylus, final broadcast). The cost—physical exhaustion, moral loneliness—lands in the earned stasis of “forever bound.” Minor slip: a touch of grandiose self-label (“lonely visionary”) is told more than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The vagrant poet’s quiet obsession is embodied through concrete ritual—pocketing tide-sighs, sandpiper heartbeats—so his inner contradiction (preserve vs. create) is palpable. No stock therapeutic labels; instead, the ache is “sweet sorrow,” a lived physiognomy. The final renunciation—placing the shell, sealing the loft-symphony—carries visible cost: he forfeits restoring the box and accepts perpetual outsider status. Micro-choices under pressure (which jar next, which sound will “sweeten” the silence) reveal a hierarchy of values that forecloses any return to ordinary nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “logical emotion” habit is dramatized in the keyed attunement sequence where she feels cells sing while calculating waveforms. The moment she files terror away and keeps turning the dial is a credible micro-choice that shows contradictory impulses co-existing in scene. Motivation remains stable, but the arc is slight: she begins competent and ends competent; the only cost is exhaustion, so renunciation/change feels under-scaled for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—feral impatience vs. the discipline of watching—remains concrete through tactile micro-choices (steady hand, plume of breath, final click). The “wild animal clawing at her ribs” recurs without becoming a dead metaphor because it is checked each time by a deliberate physical restraint. The only flaw is the late, one-sentence articulation of her grandfather’s theft; that knowledge arrives as plot patch rather than lived memory, softening the cost. Still, her shift from coiled impatience to “serene and terrible victory” is earned by the visible falter of the viaduct hum.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s skeptical empiricist bent is cleanly embodied in the way he crouches to the lantern and then re-grounds himself in mud-level evidence; the momentary psychic jolt is contradicted by his immediate reflex to “attribute…to fatigue,” showing simultaneous impulses in scene. His final micro-choice—adding the journal context to the report—pays the stated cost of defying Fletcher and is causally prepared by the lantern-induced visions and the notebook discovery. Interiority stays concrete and occupational rather than therapeutic. The only reason this stays sub-9 is that the emotional cost of that bureaucratic rebellion is asserted rather than felt on the body/page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arthur’s guilt and vocational crisis are concrete; the micro-choice to leave the heart with Elias crystallizes his shift from verbal apology to active witness. Interiority stays specific to a prison chaplain’s diction (“useless weight of his apology to an empty cell”). Yet the decisive change is articulated by Elias, not dramatized through Arthur’s own embodied beat, so the cost is vicarious rather than personally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s stubborn curiosity is embodied in every grease-smudged choice; the final “grip” moment crystallizes a life-scale cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The single lapse: no visible flaw that complicates the triumph—he’s oddly flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s fixation on Julian is a live wire under every keystroke; the “sharp pinprick of light” focus is embodied, not asserted. Internal contradiction is cleanly dramatized: she lies to Kael with “impossibly steady” voice while her heart “hammered,” a micro-choice that both protects the search and betrays her vocation. The final act—forwarding the quarantined file—pays off her obsessive trait with visible cost: the lie now seals her complicity in the breach. Only minor calibration issue: the brother’s psychological profile is sketched through telling (“astronomy obsessive”) rather than shown in-scene, but it does not undercut the closing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s desire to “map empathy onto action” is dramatized in every beat: the shard is handled, the mirror is chosen, the visions are endured, and the public translation of private truth costs him the comfort of neutrality. Interiority is concrete (“his consciousness to drift… an empty vessel”), never diagnostic, and the final stand between accuser and accused crystallizes a hierarchy of values—truth-telling over tribal calm—with the visible cost of becoming the community’s emotional lightning-rod. Flaws (outsider status, quasi-mystical duty) actively complicate the choice to speak; no safety-hedging. The single-scene crucible and relational pressure with Mara/Jorn satisfy scope; micro-revelations under cold apple boughs embody emotion without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory motives—volunteering to “trawl” others’ endings while secretly booking her own—create a sharp internal crucible that stays alive in every tactile micro-choice (rolling the parasol tip, kneeling in diesel sludge). The “fold in patience” is embodied, not labeled, when the ice calving suddenly re-tensions her wait. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the saintly mask and accepts the selfish syllabus, a renunciation legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—passionate heat versus newfound recognition of mismatched needs—surfaces in concrete micro-choices (handling the fragile fragment, redirecting gaze to the vines). Embodied emotion is strong; the analogy between vine pairings and lovers reweights his self-blame. However, the epiphany is delivered in a single reflective sweep rather than forced by an on-page test, keeping the cost intellectual, not viscerally paid. Voice remains coherent, but the absence of embodied opposition or secondary character pressure caps depth.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s quiet resolve and unwavering interiority feel lived-in; the “strangely honest” trait is shown through the pavilion rebuke, not told. The lone micro-choice—descending the spiral—carries visible cost (the mental “staggering weight” of the offering), earning his Earned Stasis. No secondary character pressure on-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Internal contradiction is present but muted; still, the restraint fits the hermetic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s calm puzzle-archivist persona is vividly embodied in his tactile handling of photos and the patient “linger” action, but interiority stays safely muted; we never feel a contradictory impulse that might fracture his composure, so the arc is smooth rather than revelatory. The final release of the paper-boat photo registers as quiet triumph, yet it is foreshadowed so gently that the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, within the lyric-accumulative mode, the stance crystallizes with credible Earned Stasis: he closes the case, foreclosing further returns, and the town’s ignorance of his labor is the price. Characterization lands just above the “strong” threshold because the职业 self-containment is consistent, but lacks a pressure crack that would push it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reticence, joint-ache kneeling, and decision to “testify, not publish” feel lived-in; the crystal listening sessions dramatize his scholar’s patience turning into wonder. Interiority avoids label-speak: “weathered face…light of a profound and innocent wonder” shows, not tells. The final renunciation costs him the academic immortality he once craved, legible in the silent chair scene. Micro-choices (tapping the glass, charting cadences) tether motive to action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s contradictory engine—prophetic foresight that erases itself—drives every beat; the micro-choice to kneel and draw the imperfect circle embodies his renunciation with visible, chalk-dust cost. Interiority stays concrete (“the feel of time itself passing over his skin”), never drifting into label-speak. The forgetting trait is not a gimmick; it narrows options until only humble presence remains, earning the closing stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief-rooted obsession to “harness the ephemeral” is embodied in every micro-choice; the sacrifice of the treasured lens carries a felt, irreversible cost. Interiority stays concrete—gnarled fingers, luminous ache—without label-speak. The final renunciation is earned: he knowingly locks the station outside time, trading salvation for perpetual stasis. One slip: Hima is present but exerts no relational pressure, so the crucible is solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is precise—‘obsessive precision’ is dramatized in the ring-clicking micro-moves. Motivation remains singular and intensifies: the phantom of the noon-shadow keeps tightening until the final click. No contradictory emotional layer is shown; she is all calm resolve, so the arc is linear rather than conflicted inside her skin. Still, the price is visible: she accepts the automaton’s dark projection as the new local law, a quiet renunciation of older certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory need for rational proof and aching desire to believe is dramatized through bodily excavation of the tooth; the moment he cups the impossible milk-curved fang, his identity as bone-setter fractures and the lifelong stance of “forgiving skeptic” incurs real cost. Interiority stays concrete—dirt-grit under fingernails, the femur-memory of snap-align—so the epistemic break feels visceral, not abstract. Micro-choice hierarchy is sharp: catalog stars or kneel to dig; choose the dig, pay the worldview rent. Only the final paragraph drifts toward label-speak (“conceptual cost,” “world broke open”) that momentarily blurs embodiment, capping slightly below pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for starlight yet grounded by fog—drives every micro-choice; the memory of the village fire seeds her refusal of flame and the final renunciation of “wrong fire” carries visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her competence (gemcraft) is balanced by the genuine struggle of coaxing light from trash. The only minor slip is a near-label phrase—“a quiet, determined goal”—that momentarily abstracts her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s watchful-quiet caretaking is shown through embodied gestures (tea, humidity checks) rather than labels; Kaelen’s fossilized shame is externalized in his fiber-optic stare. The pendant hand-off works as a micro-choice that rewrites their status: she relinquishes permanence, he accepts mutability. Interiority stays concrete—her thumb on amber, his fingers closing “not in acceptance of its grim prison” but of the choice. No therapy-speak; the only slip is “public failure” (summary label) in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—commercial cynicism versus boyish reverence for story—are dramatized in the tactile micro-choice of kneeling to bury the shell. Interiority stays concrete (“its sharp edge a familiar comfort”) and avoids therapy-speak. The final renunciation is earned because every cameo embodies a prior creative sin he now owns. Interior contradiction is active in-scene, not summarized, so the change carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s tinkerer streak surfaces in the “grease-and-pollen” fingers and gear-train simile, but interiority stays general (“surge of confidence”) and we see no contradictory impulse under pressure; the final choice reads as pre-ordained ritual rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is present yet leans on abstract hush-and-breath motifs. Motivation is clear but static; tension inside him never complicates the song. Character works; it just never faces a live trade-off that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s bone-deep listening, the deliberate slowness of each placement, and the final thumb-press that costs him “a piece of his own stillness” fuse motive to embodied action; the single contradiction—stillness versus urgent rescue—drives every beat without slipping into label-speak. Interiority stays concrete: “cold ozone and distant memories” anchors starlight as sensory memory, not abstraction. The only micro-gap: we never feel the moment his own pulse wavers, so the cost reads slightly external rather than internally rupturing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elian’s reflective-peripheral locksmith identity remains a label; the interior contradiction never crystallizes in a micro-choice that costs him anything. “Store wonder in the cellar of reason” is repeated but never dramatized as a conflicting impulse—the ledger work reads as calm procedure, not tense trade-off. No visible flaw or blind spot compounds; he succeeds exactly as planned, so the closure carries no earned cost on his person. The result is competent but emotionally flat—more portrait than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to intervene yet physically caged—are dramatized through the embodied ritual with the burner; the micro-choice of aligning star, wisp, and teeth crystallizes his values and costs. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the feather-touch of the farmer’s relief proves the link between his labor and lived consequence. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only bar to 9+ is that the final kneel replays earlier stoic endurance without fresh contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s widow identity and grief-management schema are vivid, but the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than dramatized—her carving choice is calm, not visibly costly. The interior contradiction (grief vs. need to function) is present yet static; no micro-choice after the first cut tests this stance. The memory of Leo’s stillness is concrete and character-specific, anchoring motivation. A final visible cost—blood on the wood, or irreversible relinquishing of the memory—would have pushed this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael’s regret is embodied in every motion—kneeling, sifting, pocketing the camera wheel—so the apology is lived, not declared. The contradiction between his younger arrogance and present atonement is kept active in scene by the ghost’s counter-arguments, culminating in the micro-choice to pocket the wheel and accept curation instead of bargaining. The cost is scaled exactly to the page: the carousel is gone, time is broken, and the only reparation left is to own the failure aloud. No safety-hedging: he names himself destroyer and is left immobile under that weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is concrete—her recognition of the sextant shard carries a “quiet hum of curiosity” that is hers alone. Micro-choice under pressure is visible when she risks electrocution to hot-wire the dead grid. Flaw is present: she overrates structure as a source of hope, a misbelief the climax corrects. Cost is conceptual—she sees that hope is rewired, not calculated, yet the emotional price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s gentle ritual, visible in the slow placement of each bell, externalizes an interior contradiction—his longing to voice time versus his vow of silence. The twenty-year weight is shown, not told, through the ache of the coffer and the wet slate against his knees. No secondary character appears, but the self-as-antagonist is credible. The micro-choice to leave the bells glittering in open air crystallizes renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—trailing fingers in bruise-colored water, feeling cold seep into knuckles—embodied and particular. The trembling hands on the journal, the sudden quiet that lifts his gaze: micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (truth > safety) with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (shame vs devotion) stay simultaneous, not summarized. Final renunciation of public vindication for private faith is earned by prior tactile listening to the hull and mud.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is character-specific (seed-collector’s patience reframed as “alignment with the pace of the world”) and motivates every micro-action; the contradictory impulse—preserve vs. risk destroying the knot—survives in his decision to read, not untie. Emotion stays embodied (“faint vibration…from the fulgurite”) rather than labeled. The final act of sketching is a credible renunciation of immediate possession, foreclosing the option to keep the rope intact, cost visible in the relinquished tactile artifact. Only the “infinitely patient” trait is stated once; it is immediately dramatized through the coaxing beats, so the label is forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"ghost of warmth" in the thread anchors tactile memory. The micro-choice to write is the only visible decision; earlier “projection” is narrated, not chosen, so agency is diluted. Cost is present but abstract—companionship with the absent—limiting full earned contradiction. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature ("cartographer who had finally arrived") keeps characterization above the 8-line.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s obsessive, almost prayerful interiority is vivid and consistent; every micro-choice (resin from lichen, whispering to portraits) grows from his compulsion to resurrect beauty. The hybrid chick’s birth forces a credible shift: his quaking hands finally still, a silent acceptance that the new life is not the lost purity he mourned. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed, but the arc’s cost is felt. Character remains singular, never sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is concrete and firefighter-specific (“gracefully alert, a habit learned in burning buildings”); the father-daughter arsonist/firefighter contradiction powers every choice. Emotions are embodied (“breath caught,” “unseeing stare”) rather than labeled. The grafting beat is a visible micro-choice that hierarchy-values the banyan over her last relic of father, paying cost in the snapped thread. Change is earned: she literally trades the coin’s dead weight for a living bond, foreclosing her old tether to him.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s “luminous skeptic” contradiction is dramatized in embodied micro-choices—her steady hand rotating the box while her breath hitches—so the interior split is alive in scene. The ancestral box, tapestry star-chart, and marble discoloration are used as tactile extensions of her will, not props; each micro-adjustment of the box is a visible bet of her identity. The final refusal to open the box yet releasing the city’s memory is a credible renunciation that costs her the proof her rational mind craved, giving earned stasis. Only the “sharp ache” veers toward diagnostic label; the lapse is brief and instantly grounded in the whisper of water that follows, so the flaw touches but does not break the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Xylar’s ache is evoked through concrete nebula imagery rather than labels; the gear-handling beat crystallizes its flaw—seeking a calculable escape from feeling. The final broadcast is earned because the earlier empathy-sonar has already been dramatized as both perception and wound. Slight abstraction in “inherited sorrow” keeps it from 9-band, but interior contradiction and embodied reaction remain consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s haunted diligence and tactile obsession feel lived-in; the embodied chiseling, storm-lit greenhouse vigil, and final quiet renunciation all spring from a single, contradiction-laden impulse—finish grandmother’s slate to learn how communal sorrow “connects.” Interiority stays concrete (cool ribbon under fingertips, thunder inside ribs) and avoids label-speak. The cost—trading literal grave-name commerce for an abstract, unsellable web—hurts on the page. Only the grandmother’s “spectral mentorship” drifts toward convenience, never fully dramatized as an active pressure voice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s ritualized interiority is vivid and embodied—micro-choices (waiting for the pendulum pause, fingers tensing around the rake handle) dramatize the contradictory tug between containment and release. The ethical-diligent trait isn’t labeled; it’s lived through the painstaking knife-work of carving names and the yearly return to the tower. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character to test status shifts; at this length that’s acceptable, so the arc of earned endurance lands with cost visible in the final cadence-smoothing image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’ obsession is vivid, but the story withholds the concrete micro-choices that show how each night’s labour alters his tactical path; we are told “weeks” of work rather than shown a single beat where a new thread forces him to recalibrate. The final gesture—placing the case on the new shelf—reads as gentle catharsis rather than Earned Stasis because no prior scene established that this reunion would exact a visible forfeiture. Interiority is atmospheric, yet the emotional contradiction between caretaker-duty and grave-robber guilt is never let into the present tense to complicate his fingers’ next move.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—yearning to thaw a frozen culture while imprisoned by glacial data—grounds every beat. The embodied tremor in “the frantic pulse in his own ears” fuses physiology with dread. Micro-choices (to prune extinction branches, to condemn elders’ habits) scale to kingdom stakes, and the final inhale before ink hits vellum crystallizes cost. Voice remains uniform, no status crucible present; hence 8.7 not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, ritualized diligence is concrete and embodied; the contradiction between daylight transcription of state marches and night-time smuggling of luminous ink is lived in every micro-choice. Interiority stays in the copyist’s perceptual register—vellum texture, nib angle, radio dial glow—never sliding into abstract self-analysis. The final angle of the page under the dial’s light crystallizes his renunciation of safety with visible cost, earning the stoic calm he assumes. Flaws are present but safety-hedged: risk is asserted more than dramatized, keeping him just shy of full moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s curator-of-endings persona is vividly embodied in her micro-choices—selecting which truths to omit, timing the chair’s push—so her calm predation feels lived-in. Kael’s grief is shown through trembling hands and the white-knuckled urn rather than labels. The internal contradiction—offering peace while knowing it is temporary—drives every beat, and the final stilled chair is an earned renunciation whose cost is felt in her “heavy, knowing stone” chest. Voice convergence under stress is avoided; Elara’s serene diction never slips into Kael’s rasp.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s interiority is razor-sharp: the brass cog “screamed of a civilization that had mastered longitude” is a perfect, character-specific percept. His abrasive calm never slips into authorial diagnosis; the resignation that closes the piece is embodied in the velvet-lined box, not declared. The child’s entrance supplies instant status pressure, forcing Silas to test—and abandon—conversion, a micro-choice that crystallizes his mission. Flaw: the girl is sketched only enough to trigger his stance; she’s more catalyst than crucible, so relationship dynamics can’t quite lift to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-specific: the “expectantly resigned sigh” and the tactile worry of the zither rosette embody his weariness. His micro-choice—dismissing the choir into tense silence, then abandoning sheet music—shows a visible pivot. The ending’s Charged Poise is earned: his choice to subtract rather than add reweights the stake, and the cost—two grudging years of failure—lingers in the room. Secondary pressure from the choir is diffuse, but Elias’s fatigue and gentle authority remain legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s palate-gift is vivid and embodied; every snip is a micro-choice that costs him visceral pain. The interior contradiction—he is a cook, not a surgeon of souls—drives the arc. Flaws (bitter nostalgia, hubris of rewriting culture) complicate each cut, but the shift from despair to hope is asserted more than dramatized in the final beat, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's compulsive truthfulness is vividly dramatized; the refusal to hand over the lacquer box’s contents anchors his “preserve wonder” creed in a costly micro-choice. Lena remains slightly more functional than individuated, but her exhaustion and the moment of poetic comprehension land. Interiority is concrete; no label-speak. The final nod carries earned stasis: he keeps the box closed, accepting perpetual outsider status. A hairline slip: we never see Silas privately doubt or resent his affliction under pressure, so the depth stops just short of 9 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s quiet, obsessive mission is credibly particularized: the orris-root comfort gesture, the precise catalog of grey contagion, the furtive swaps. Interiority stays concrete—she smells violet/earth, feels the frantic heart—without therapeutic self-labeling. The final realization that she seeds questions, not life, is earned by earlier stealth beats and visibly costs her the priestess self-image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “indoctrinated fury” dismantled by embodied micro-choices (unclipping ampoule, digging silt). The contradiction between crusader identity and emerging tenderness is held in-scene, not narrated. Galen’s telepathy is less a second character than externalized conscience, so relationship crucible is waived; single-POV test is met. Final burial of the ampoule is earned renunciation with visible cost—she forfeits surface allegiance and accepts exile.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—grim optimism driving obsessive logic—remains vivid and embodied; the dice-chip as “key” crystallizes his micro-choice hierarchy. The endurance-of-flaw arc lands with felt cost when the reopened wound of regret is “agonizingly perfect.” No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority stays particular, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choices (scratching proofs, final roll) trace a credible value hierarchy under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s insomnia-painter identity is vivid and embodied; the “waking dream” mechanism gives concrete interior access. His micro-choice to risk public exposure by lighting the canvases crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The final beat of strangers echoing ‘witness’ back at him externalizes his internal arc with visible cost—his body trembling, lungs aching—so the change is legible and paid for. No contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses; interior contradiction would have pushed it over.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Alistair’s curator reflex with the emerald lens is concrete and specific; his shift from despair to sonic strategist is legible. Interiority stays in historically-trained perception rather than abstract emotion. The “warm A loaf” beat crystallizes his stake, but the council/elder voices remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship pressure is muted. Earned cost is present—the city sings itself back to life—but his personal flaw/compromise is not foregrounded, capping depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s monomania is vivid—his hands “softening” as time rewinds embodies the cost. Yet the interiority leans on abstract labels (“bleak exhilaration,” “cold fire”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. No secondary character appears, so the crucible is purely self-versus-time; the arc lands as a credible renunciation of forward causality, but the emotional granularity feels slightly over-articulated for a man mid-transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“a sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie”), contradictions flare under pressure, micro-choices track goal vs self-protection. The void-as-weapon twist is foreshadowed by mirror-flinching and advisor’s silken scrape, earning the final renunciation. Slight over-articulation of “photographically cursed” and “soul void” nudges toward diagnostic-speak, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kai’s interiority is consistently concrete—”the familiar thrum of anxiety, not of fear, but of anticipation for the performance”—and his embodied choices (charcoal sketch, timed mallet strikes) braid want/need without exposition. The final renunciation—tucking the mallet away after turning annihilation into song—pays the visible cost of perpetual vigilance. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; single-POV focus is exploited fully. Micro-choices under storm pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: aesthetics > survival > rest, all shown through percussion timing and salt-tasting breath.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet drive stays credible: he keeps choosing the tower, the whistle, the watchers, each time at slight but rising cost (neighbor scorn, bodily dread). Interiority is concrete—“sun-baked certainty,” “trembling fingers”—never abstract labels. The final reconfiguration is earned: his mother’s fate and the city’s doom hinge on the same pattern he alone deciphers, so the whistle-crack feels like personal inheritance snapping. No contradictory impulses on stage, but the piece is short; one visible moment of simultaneous fear/obsession would have tipped this into the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thorne’s calm, historian-dialectic persona is sharply drawn via embodied micro-shifts (measured metronome voice; forward-lean on bench). Elara’s tension lives in tactile grip on the case and the visible millstone moment. Their status flip is cleanly legible and motivated. Voice diction converges only slightly under stress; interiority stays concrete, no label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is consistently and materially rendered through the inkwell, the water, and the act of sealing vellum into stone; every micro-choice (wading, sealing, frantic retrieval) is both geologist-precise and emotionally legible. His stoic/sensitive contradiction is dramatized in the inkwell drop: the involuntary gasp and raw-knuckled clutch expose the cost of caring without ever naming the feeling. The archeologist-of-absence mission motivates every beat; the retrieved inkwell becomes an earned talisman that forecloses the option of ever quitting. No diagnostic self-talk—only gesture, tool, and habitat—so the characterization stays embodied and irreducible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—dutiful archivist vs. truth-seeker—beats live in every tactile micro-choice (the gloved finger, the neck-craning readjustment). The coral stamp is not a prop but an extension of his perceptual bias; its texture grounds the final renunciation, paying the conceptual cost of silence. No stock phrasing, no epiphany label—just embodied stillness that forecloses the easy path of announcement.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s grief-shocked interiority is vivid: “the sorrow was a formless, heavy water he could not cup” marries metaphor to embodied helplessness; the polishing ritual externalizes contradiction—he polishes to clarify memory yet risks erasing it. Despair and craft twine in every micro-choice, culminating in Earned Stasis: he keeps folding pain into cranes, the cost (lifetime labor) legible. No secondary character for status crucible, but single-POV depth compensates; only a hairline short of 9 because the final stance is crystallized rather than dramatized in an overt scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amal’s grief is viscerally embodied; the geode as tactile memory anchor works. Interiority stays specific to her physicist lens, though the “raw, humming truth” line flirts with abstraction. The final beat—coordinates as trajectory—earns her turn from grief to weaponized purpose with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s pilot-skills, isolation, and yearning for “belonging” are concrete and texture every beat; the final smile is earned by her active manipulation of the drone and chip. No contradictory impulses in-scene, but the interiority is slightly performative (“hummed in her bones”). The cost—acceptance of cosmic conversation—lands as quiet euphoria rather than tangible loss, keeping her just shy of crucible-level change.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’ guilt and need to atone are visceral; the single watch hand is a constant embodied reminder. Interiority is specific—his “acidic burn” and the “sieved hush” are sensory, not diagnostic. One flaw: the moment he decides to restore memories is declared rather than dramatized with a micro-choice on the page, so the final shift feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—brass pull as tactile conscience—and his micro-choice to fit it into the lockbox physically externalizes his “recycling” creed. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under peak pressure: he never hesitates or weighs refusal, so the arc is pure competence rather than earned flaw. The boy and Kaelen remain functional vessels; their lack of interiority is acceptable at this length but limits the relationship crucible. Closure earns a stasis rather than change, yet the cost (lion pull’s warmth fading) is felt, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt-riven paralysis is viscerally embodied—trembling hand, judge-and-jury compass. The interior contradiction—yearning for the sea while fearing he’ll repeat the shoal error—drives every beat. Micro-choice at the waterline (offering, not pocketing, the compass) crystallizes the hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior voice stays salt-scarred and specific; no therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“the hollow spaces between his thoughts”); the baseball anchors contradictory impulses across beats; the final spark is earned because the letter rewrites his blank-page premise at felt cost. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “a ghost of awe” that momentarily abstracts an otherwise visceral moment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—grief as “vast, silent ocean” is specific, not diagnostic. Micro-choices (kneeling, grinding spices) align with the single-minded goal and show the hierarchy of values. The reluctant metamorphosis is dramatized through the flare of scales and the moment he “pushed past the fear,” earning the final shared existence. Only the absence of any second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible development, but the self-as-crucible is convincingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“terrifying undertow of loss” is a concrete, embodied image—and her micro-choice of unfastening the cloak carries cost. Yet the epiphany “lost time…was simply vapor” arrives as declarative summary rather than dramatized contradiction, softening the stakes at the hinge beat. The flaw is forgivable, but it keeps the change from feeling fully earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s pacifism and grief-steward motive stay consistent; every photograph she anoints forces a visible body-weight shift that externalizes inner conflict. The micro-choice to forgive the universe—and her child-self—pays the entire cost of the quest, landing as earned stasis. Interiority rarely lapses into label-speak, though “ghostly resolve” edges close. One more contradiction live in scene would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is textured and consistent—his barefoot sinking into obsidian, the spiral shell as “map,” the lightning-bug release as tactile philosophy. The arc from curiosity to accidental prophecy-fulfillment is credible because every beat is filtered through his embodied attention; the final palm-to-sand moment crystallizes the cost of understanding. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only serene assent; that keeps it from 9+. Still, the portrayal is individual, unsentimental, and motive-locked to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s calmly inventive trait is dramatized through the tactile quill-key sequence; the contradiction between obedient mask and revolutionary intent is held in-scene. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible as he weighs exposure risk vs. network ignition. Final smile carries cost—irreversible betrayal of the old guard—earned by prior causality. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak intrudes on the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his curse and promise drive every beat. The “magnetic boots clung” line fuses bodily stakes to world rules. Micro-choices (pouring star dust into the circuit) crystallize values under pressure. Emotional layering is strong, yet the eels remain symbolic; their panic doesn’t feedback to complicate his decision, so the crucible feels solo, not relational.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s contradictory calm/rage is continuously embodied (the statue body vs. screaming hurricane) and drives the micro-choices—winding the timer, refusing to open the envelope early, finally trembling. The scars motive is kept concrete through the photographer’s negative and the key. The shift from vigil to exit is credibly paid for by the hour of forced stillness, so the decision to leave carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s drive to “turn questions into destinations” is dramatized through the fencing sequence, but his interior contradiction—philosopher vs. duelist—stays mostly abstract; no moment of genuine error or visible emotional cost is shown, so the arc feels elegant rather than lived. The mechanical arm is sensuously handled yet never limits or surprises him, blunting its potential as a flaw. What saves him from stereotype is the patient, almost ritual patience of the opening wait, but the payoff is cerebral, not viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s monthly “molt” from Reckoner to Architect is dramatized through the quiet act of sorting books; the embodied shift from cataloguing failures to seeing “potential” gives us a credible, visible cost. Elara’s single calming hand-touch shows their history without exposition. The arrival of the two drifters crystallizes a new relational crucible: Silas risks his fragile peace by offering the poem, so the stance-change is earned. Interiority stays concrete—“his breath caught”—and avoids label-speak, though the poem line “stars see more than just our scars” flirts with aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s grief-to-resolve arc is vivid—his body listens to the piano, the reel, the compasses—but the “strategically creative” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we watch him execute a pre-memorized plan rather than invent under duress. The interior contradiction (grief vs. blade-sharp hope) is present yet static until the final step; a mid-scene micro-choice that visibly risks failure would have raised the score. Still, the embodied emotion and the cost of leaving the piano behind carry credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—methodical skepticism vs. leap of faith—stays alive in her micro-choices (hands press seed, breath hitches) and the final renunciation of proof for song. The “luminous doubt” flaw is not hedged; it remains lit inside the closure image, paying visible cost. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Almost 9.0 but final epiphany still drifts toward abstract label (“question that kept the story alive”) rather than a last embodied beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kenji’s grief is embodied in the ritual of trimming juniper and in the tactile handling of compass and lace; the interior contradiction between clinging and releasing is present. The final shift from “sharp crystalline shard” to “soft forgiving glow” is earned by the preceding deciphering work and the on-page compass event. Yet the micro-choice that actually triggers the diffusion is interior and passive—he simply “closed his eyes” and felt warmth—so the cost feels slightly under-dramatized. Still, the arc from obsessive search to acceptance is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete and particular—his scientific detachment, grief over the orchid, and shift toward humility feel earned. His micro-choices (sitting with the pane, wiping a circle clean) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final decision to seek the shovel emerges from layered contradictions: rationalist vs. emotional, observer vs. participant. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear of fire, her observational shift to frost, and her final act of creation feel earned through micro-choices (e.g., refusing the kiln, then returning to it). Her contradiction—artist who fears flame yet seeks pattern in destruction—is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. The ledger discovery triggers agency, not passive epiphany. Final choice integrates trauma into craft with visible cost: she seals the past rather than erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied: her trauma (capsize) and goal (translate silence into music) fuse in the climactic act of weaving violet bloom-light with memory-orange into a silent symphony. Her internal contradiction—terror vs. hope—manifests physically through the circlet and thermal vision, not abstract labels. The final choice to integrate rather than suppress trauma feels earned, with exhaustion and peace as tangible costs. No diagnostic self-awareness mars peak stress; emotion stays sensory and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s weariness, inadvertent stubbornness, and desperate pursuit of silence are embodied through precise sensory detail and micro-choices—especially his decision to fold reality rather than dive. His internal contradiction (longing for peace yet drawn to chaos) manifests in action, not summary. The final act of fitting the lens into the astrolabe is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost: lifelong noise resolved into earned stasis. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from survival to intergenerational reconnection, grounded in embodied detail (“hollowed cheeks,” “stooped shoulders”) and micro-choices (distributing food, initiating runs). Her internal contradiction—suspicion versus hope—is active in scene, not summarized. The bell triggers a shift that feels earned, not epiphanic, and her final declaration crystallizes values with visible cost: vulnerability before an unseen benefactor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain tactile and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in her spiritually curious nature and embodied through precise micro-choices—retrieving the quartz, adjusting breath, aiming the lens—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict pulses with contradictory impulses: the ache for closure versus the surrender to transformation. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through sensory perception and physical ritual. The final renunciation of seeking a “place” for love is earned by prior causality and carries quiet, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to feel the texture of time—is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory language and consistent with his monastic focus. His internal contradiction (desire for knowledge vs. self-destruction) plays out in real-time micro-choices, especially when he aligns the fragment with the maze’s geometry. The final renunciation—erasing his own memory to break the artifact’s hold—is earned by prior causality and carries devastating, visible cost: total amnesia. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through fraying images and trembling leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: her strategic patience, embodied in micro-choices like reordering keys and activating defenses, reveals a hierarchy of values where collective resilience outweighs personal freedom. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through action—e.g., calm amid chaos, bound yet orchestrating liberation. The final Earned Stasis (“body bound, purpose free”) carries visible cost and forecloses escape, fully earned by prior causality. No slips in voice or emotional calibration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—capturing the sound of broken trust—is rooted in visceral, embodied memory and drives every action with escalating stakes. His synesthesia isn’t a gimmick but a perceptual lens that informs his method and emotional reality. The final choice to wear the crystal demonstrates earned renunciation: he doesn’t replay the pain but contains it, foreclosing endless reliving at the cost of permanent scarification. Interior contradiction pulses throughout—obsession versus healing, creation versus destruction—without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motivation—stealing portraits to “press your ear against destiny’s door”—is vividly embodied and consistent, deepening credibly when confronted with the jar of moonbeams. His internal contradiction (thief of past moments vs. custodian of future possibilities) resolves through a micro-choice with felt cost: abandoning his old collection’s inertness for uncertain futures. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“chill traced its way up his spine,” “weight both negligible and immense”). Final renunciation is earned by prior causality: his floral code literacy enables reinterpretation that pivots his entire worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—crafting “safe zones for inquiry”—is compellingly rooted in trauma and profession, and her internal conflict (grief vs. creation) intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (abandoning the sphere, taking the bookmark) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, the emotional shift from frozen grief to “weighty lightness” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“thawing heart,” “steady trickle of feeling”) that borders on label-speak without full embodiment. The renunciation is earned, but the final emotional calibration feels marginally too tidy for the depth of loss established.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation evolves credibly from shattered identity to empowered agency, rooted in the “firmly adaptive” trait and embodied vulnerability. Internal conflict is layered—fear versus resolve, constructed past versus emergent truth—and crystallizes in the climactic choice to activate the failsafe. Julian’s presence sharpens status dynamics without over-explaining; their history simmers in subtext. The final tremor of “violent, powerful certainty” feels earned, not declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s mild obsession is embodied through precise, watchmaker-like gestures and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values—mapping silence over survival. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile perception (calloused ink-stained fingers, the “marbled hush”). The final Earned Stasis—sitting as “a patient stone against the coming dark”—feels inevitable, not declared, with cost implied in his isolation and ritualized depletion. No secondary characters dilute focus; his contradiction (obsession vs. patience) operates simultaneously in every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit 734’s motivation—“to find where thoughts come from”—is deeply embodied through micro-choices across loops, culminating in a high-stakes interface with the violin. Its interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, cognition is dramatized via error warnings bypassed and port activation. The final epiphany (“The G-string sounds a little flat tonight”) emerges not as exposition but as sensory inheritance, credibly foreign yet resonant. Flaws are consistent: its machine logic both enables and limits, making its earned endurance profoundly human.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his yearning, mistrust, and flawed attempts at understanding feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Lena’s silent actions reveal her grief without exposition, and their shared history informs micro-choices (e.g., Elias leaving his desk). The final exchange avoids tidy resolution; the thaw is delicate, earned by his act of witnessing and offering the lens. No therapy-speak or stock phrasing mars their psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in lived contradiction: his low luck score versus his deep horticultural wisdom. His interiority is embodied through tactile rituals (polishing marbles, poultices) rather than exposition. The final act—cracking a pristine marble—reveals a hierarchy of values where earned resilience outweighs perfection. His pragmatic endurance forecloses assimilation into data-driven gardening with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s characterization is grounded in tactile specificity—his stained hands, occupational identity, and quiet competence under pressure feel lived-in. His micro-choice to pull the lever embodies a hierarchy of values: loyalty over skepticism, action over theory. Aris’s trembling obsession contrasts Elias’s steadiness without caricature, and their dynamic pressures Elias toward a transformation that feels earned. The vertigo of realization avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead manifesting as embodied awe (“mechanically warm truth in the cold corners of his soul”).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—decoding a ghost’s message through water-damaged paper—is consistent, specific, and intensifies credibly to his decisive act of immersion. His interiority is embodied (“heart hammering,” “strange creative fever”) without diagnostic labels, and his micro-choice to disrupt the water’s surface reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over preservation. The final renunciation of passive reverence for active creation feels earned, with visible cost (the program’s ruin). No secondary characters dilute focus; this single-POV execution exemplifies character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied and contradictory—her grief is “auroral,” her mind an “oracular machine” parsing paradox. Her micro-choice to stop deciphering the smudged word reveals a hierarchy of values: preserving ambiguity over certainty. The flaw of needing Liam suspended between triumph and failure feels inevitable, not diagnostic. Final renunciation is earned through prior causality with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—between swallowed guilt and desperate need for absolution—is embodied through concrete, sensory-driven choices (e.g., forcing the valve shut with the weight of his confession). His skepticism isn’t just stated but tested and transformed under pressure. The final act of physical intervention mirrors his emotional reckoning without diagnostic label-speak. His flaws drive the narrative: passivity becomes agency only when he recognizes kinship with the ghosts’ unresolved blame.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—dust on feet, trembling hands, sensory overload—and their motivation (to witness without judgment) collides credibly with the psychological cost of absorbing too much history. The internal conflict between duty and self-preservation manifests in micro-choices: reaching for the swan, choosing silence over return. However, the final renunciation lacks a decisive *on-page* trade-off; the cost is implied but not enacted, preventing full Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak or gestural poverty mars the portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s grief is embodied with specificity—the white knuckles, the trembling fingers, the shift from desperate clutching to tender protection—and Elias’s motivation avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in action (“nurture lifelong wonder” is shown through his adaptive music and guiding touch). The micro-choice to rest her palm on the earth crystallizes her internal shift without over-explanation. Both characters remain flawed yet credible; Lena’s sorrow isn’t “fixed,” but recontextualized. The final smile carries earned fragility, not tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “sensitively perceptive” nature manifests in tactile engagement with diaries and tapestry, not abstract labels. His motivation (collecting echoes) intensifies credibly into sorrowful comprehension, culminating in Earned Stasis: he accepts his role as archivist of loss, not restorer. The final renunciation carries visible cost—“let the great bronze quiet... reclaim the space”—and aligns with his consistent traits. No diagnostic self-awareness or stock phrasing mars his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to transpose life into a new key—is deeply woven into his actions and final renunciation, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His internal contradiction (control vs. surrender) manifests in micro-choices: writing fortunes to orchestrate others while denying himself direct contact. The closure choice feels earned, with visible cost (abandoning his post, identity, and purpose). His “accidentally prophetic” trait is embodied, not merely stated, shaping both tactics and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Alistair’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions—drives every rhetorical choice with palpable cost; Elara’s possession isn’t just exorcised but philosophically unraveled. Interiority is embodied in micro-choices: tapping the loop pedal, leaning in, modulating voice. The entity’s logic frays not through force but through layered questioning that reveals its foundational flaw. Final renunciation of monochrome truth carries conceptual weight earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—chronological homesickness and the desire to conduct causality’s symphonies—is vividly embodied through tactile memory-mapping and physical exhaustion. His internal contradiction (yearning for temporal origin vs. orchestrating destiny) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final micro-choice—drawing the arcing line based on childhood optimism—is earned by prior causality and exacts a visible cost: total depletion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through concrete action (trembling hand, held breath, gasp at mirrored horizon).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his buoyancy, grief, and procedural prison feel inseparable from his psyche. His micro-choice to stop fighting the memory (“This time, he did not fight”) is earned through repeated failure and carries tangible cost: loss of levity, absorption of pain. The final descent to solid ground crystallizes his transformation without diagnostic label-speak. Only slight abstraction in “conquer the labyrinth of self” prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through tactile music—is embodied in precise, contradictory choices: she clings to a broken needle yet uses it to create connection. Her deafness isn’t a label but a lived constraint shaping every action. The audience’s silent reactions reveal her impact without dialogue, proving interiority through external ripple. Final renunciation of sound for resonant silence is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—his emotional calibration mirrors meteorological rigor, and his micro-choices (approaching the bird, interpreting data) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in intellectual integrity.

    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, caution, and longing manifest through tactile detail (the vial, humid air) rather than diagnostic labels. His final choice to grieve is earned by the causal chain of memory, scent, and revelation. Contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. pursuit of pain) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when he both fears and seeks the flower’s bloom. The cost—accepting irrevocable loss—is felt in tears that function as tribute, not collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his calloused finger on clay, raspy voice, wry smile—and his motivation to “discover the texture of time” emerges organically from his poetic worldview. His ethical playfulness surfaces in his metaphor of “burned books” versus a “pristine page,” revealing layered contradictions without diagnostic self-awareness. The frayed rope anchors his past trauma and informs his present refusal of false binaries, making his final choice feel earned.

    Elara’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished song of the world—is embodied through precise, character-specific choices: placing the bowl, selecting notes that “offer” rather than shatter silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his contradictory impulses (to isolate joy from sorrow, to empathize yet extract) act simultaneously during the subsumption sequence. His micro-choices (hovering before touch, centering breath, decanting only joy) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: he retains the sorrow as residue. The motivation to “fuse insight with empathy” isn’t stated then forgotten; it drives his self-sacrificial technique. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beat; emotion is embodied in static charges, chest-weight, and electric flares.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Alina are vividly rendered through specific gestures (her locket-touching, his collar-adjusting) and profession-rooted worldviews that shape their emotional logic. Their motivations—Elias’s quiet admiration for unseen labor, Alina’s grief-as-presence—are consistent and deepen organically. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; emotions are embodied (“hands trembled,” “voice soft as sea mist”). However, Elias’s pivotal decision lacks sufficient internal friction—he acts on empathy without visible struggle, slightly flattening the cost of his risk.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation—yearning for belonging—is embodied through tactile choices (abandoning his reed-bird, weaving protective mats) rather than stated. His “boldly sympathetic” nature drives the pivotal act of pointing out the fissure, a micro-choice with relational consequence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; his “luminescent ache” is sensory and specific. The final shift from solitary art to communal care feels earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing artistic autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation as a natural history illustrator seeking the “birthplace of echoes” is vividly embodied in his actions and perception, not merely stated. His internal contradiction—between observation and intervention—is resolved through a high-stakes choice that forecloses passive witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief manifests through tactile rituals, not diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (placing the eyes, channeling absence into stone) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over forgetting, precision over catharsis. The contradiction between his desire to quantify loss and the ineffable nature of emotion fuels every action without tidy resolution.

His kindly methodical nature isn’t stated but shown in tactile actions and quiet observation. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak; his satisfaction is a “quiet click,” not an epiphany. Flaws are implicit in his invisibility, yet his competence never feels contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to “thresh meaning from experience”—is embodied in his insomnia, tactile engagement with mud and amber, and final sketch. His internal contradiction (futility vs. compulsion) acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The woman’s presence applies immediate pressure without caricature, and her backstory reconfigures his artistic purpose. Final choice—sketching her face instead of the landscape—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing abstract pursuit for human specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s internal conflict—between duty and doubt, foresight and blindness—is rendered with concrete embodiment (“hand raised,” “certainty eroding”) and culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. Her flaw (misinterpreting her role as jailer rather than steward) directly shapes the climax. Kael’s motivation remains consistent and catalytic without over-explanation. The final micro-choice—lowering her hand—carries visible cost: loss of clairvoyance, replaced by humble presence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)

His analytically artistic perception directly shapes action (reading cracks as language), and his final acceptance of guardianship feels earned through prior choices. The emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, grounding transformation in tactile decisions (using the punch, stepping through). His flaw—obsession with mapping truth—is both strength and cost, crystallized in the Earned Stasis of becoming keeper.

    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his skepticism, grief, and reluctant hope manifest through tactile detail (thumb on obsidian, charcoal in storm) and micro-choices (nearly hurling the tile, then transcribing). His shift from cataloging “ghosts” to accepting “connection” feels earned, not epiphanic. The grandmother exists off-page yet exerts pressure through memory, notes, and the tile. Final renunciation of skepticism carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)

Contradictory impulses (longing for memory vs. acceptance of erasure) coexist without resolution, avoiding diagnostic phrasing. The final renunciation (“I will wait for the next tide”) is earned by prior acts of curation and carries the cost of perpetual liminality. Interiority remains concrete, filtered through container acoustics and tidal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—decoding Thorne’s riddle—is rooted in a truth-seeking identity that intensifies under pressure, culminating in a resonant renunciation of public validation for private revelation. His interiority is concrete (“dust motes dancing in the slanted moonlight his only audience”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)

His final conscious act crystallizes his arc: dream becomes duty, and hope becomes craft.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)

Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; her epiphany about the ship carving feels earned, not imposed.

    Kaelen’s motivation—discovering meaning in the margins—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (chalk, clipboard, envelope) and consistent interiority. His “carefully inventive” method reveals a hierarchy of values: analog trust over digital efficiency, human residue over sterile data.

His motivation evolves credibly from survival to artistry, with the final act of writing grounded in the earned shift from fragmentation to coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Julian’s grief is embodied with visceral specificity—sweaty palms, ragged breath, phantom sensations—and his flawed, desperate motivation drives every micro-choice. Madame Vex functions as a precise pressure point, not a caricature, and her dual motives (fee and story) sharpen the ethical ambiguity. The apology isn’t tidy forgiveness but a “fractured and painful absolution,” avoiding diagnostic label-speak while revealing interior contradiction through action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Witness’s motivation—to unify self with cosmic silence—is consistent, embodied through her ritual walk and handling of the dictionary. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, perception and action merge (“peeling back the layers of her own consciousness as she paced”).

However, internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his ritual counting, tactile focus on the obsidian edge, and embodied stillness reveal a mind shaped by obsession and reverence. His final renunciation (“not to correct this beautiful flaw”) emerges from prior causality: his grandfather’s wisdom, his belief in clocks as membranes, and the glacier’s intrusion all converge without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—understanding the physics of letting go—is embodied through his spatial perception, micro-choices (e.g., thumbing the laser button), and emotional contradiction (longing vs. release). His flaw (obsessive control over grief) drives every action and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses clinging.

Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels—grief is embodied in rhythm, memory, and tactile sensation.

    Kael’s motivation—“aesthetically driven” pilgrimage to paraphrase the quartz’s song—is vividly embodied through his sensory immersion and dissolution of self.

The woman’s arc is quieter but legible through gesture and micro-choices (hesitant steps, tracing constellations).

Julian’s ghost-of-the-gold-rush demeanor contrasts effectively without flattening into archetype. The confessional beat feels earned because it emerges from tactile work, not exposition.

His emotional state degrades believably—panic lances, breath hitches, sanity frays—without diagnostic label-speak. The drafting compass and organ chord are handled as extensions of his will, not props. Final renunciation of fear is earned through embodied struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of his motivation and method; his interiority is rendered through tactile, sensory precision rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—handling the ribbon, scratching the canvas—reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over recognition, empathy over justice. The final ache of sorrow is earned through embodied process, not abstract epiphany. His flaw actively shapes every action and the story’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in ancestral legacy and idealism, rendered through concrete actions—thumbing the nail, cross-referencing logs, pressing it into the rock—that reveal his internal conflict between inherited shame and defiant hope. His “nervously confident” trait manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic labels, especially in the cliff-edge metaphor and trembling hands. The final choice to broadcast Eva’s truth feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he risks professional ruin to restore her name. No safety-hedging; his flaw (idealism bordering on obsession) drives both discovery and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his musician’s perception, survival-honed observation, and emotional shift from passive witness to active seeker feel specific and earned. His motivation (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) emerges organically from lived limitation, not abstraction. The final choice—to play the fluttering code—is a credible escalation of his established traits. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (longing vs. agency) pulse in action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his calm masks inherited trauma, and his actions (territorial markers, silence) reveal a hierarchy of values that reject both his father’s violence and the startup’s extraction. His final renunciation (“stepped outside” the cycle) is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in lost connection and enduring solitude. The CEO confrontation crystallizes his stance without over-explanation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in objects and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling hands, the scent of dried petals, the weight of generational obsession—all filtered through a voice that avoids diagnostic labels. His motivation (decoding the temple) intensifies credibly under pressure, and his final act of writing-as-healing emerges organically from established traits. The micro-choice to transcribe sorrow rather than solve glyphs reconfigures his role from seeker to witness. However, the internal contradiction between control and surrender in lucid dreaming isn’t dramatized as simultaneous tension—it’s sequential, slightly softening the psychological complexity required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s guarded serenity and grief-forged discipline are embodied through micro-choices (e.g., ignoring memory ghosts, deploying the seed) and internal contradiction (fortress walls vs. emotional thaw). Her motivation—recovering a frozen confession—is rooted in a specific past failure and intensifies credibly under pressure. The final weeping is earned by her unbending effort and the devastating truth revealed. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain visceral and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—sap-slowed blood, Dissonance scars as cartography—and her motivation (to re-knit frayed timelines) intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choice to heed Kael’s warning and focus on the clipping reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: rejecting false peace for uncertain labor. However, Kael remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth; his presence is psychic, not physical, which narrows but doesn’t invalidate the dual-POV dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “fiercely gentle” focus, guilt, and desperate hope coexist without resolution. His micro-choices (offering memory instead of fighting shadow) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Motivation stems from a consistent, flawed idealism that intensifies under pressure. The burned tarot card and river stone aren’t just symbols—they’re extensions of his embodied remorse.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—calloused fingers, ringing ears, the tactile memory of cloth—and his “confidently uncertain” state drives micro-choices with emotional cost. His renunciation isn’t tidy; he doesn’t discard the past but repositions it as “evidence,” foreclosing denial with quiet finality. The flashback to Chicago is triggered by sensory detail, not exposition, and alters his present action (placing the cloth on the desk). Flaws feel lived-in, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in grief, intellectual rigor, and love—is embodied through precise actions (tending flora, planting the seed) and interior contradictions (sorrow vs. inquiry). Her “kindly methodical” trait isn’t labeled but shown in ritualistic care that carries emotional weight. The final choice—to plant as inquiry, not mourning—is earned by prior causality and forecloses magical resurrection, accepting instead a reconfigured relationship with absence. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from tactile engagement, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelan’s interiority is exquisitely embodied through sensory perception and mechanical metaphor, avoiding diagnostic labels while rendering emotional transformation as physical process. Their contradictory impulses—order vs. empathy, destruction vs. preservation—act simultaneously during the smelting, not as alternating states. The final act of placing the refined memory-smelt back in the creel reveals a hierarchy of values: wonder preserved through cyclical sacrifice. Motivation is consistent, costly, and inseparable from identity migration.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interior conflict—between duty and his yearning to reconnect humanity—is rendered with concrete, embodied specificity: the marrow-deep hum, the warmth of the pearl like “a transfusion of pure yearning.” His final choice is earned by consistent motivation and culminates in visible cost: the renunciation of his inspector’s oath. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile perception and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his raw nerves, the weight of the accordion, the obsessive mapping—all feel specific and lived-in. His contradictory impulses (seeking control through cartography while drowning in guilt) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to leave the accordion behind is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak intrudes; his epiphany arises from concrete interaction with graffiti and instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—driven by regret, trust, and unspoken truth—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the watch and journal. Her internal conflict (desperation vs. precision) manifests in micro-choices like repositioning in the mist or transcribing phrases under pressure. The “confidence man” remains off-page, so relationship dynamics are implied rather than enacted, but Elara’s emotional arc is credible and specific. Final renunciation—facing the messenger after capturing “Stay”—carries visible cost: the dissolution of the library and loss of protective veil.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interior conflict is vividly embodied—the mulberry ache, trembling hands, and sensory overload from the vine—all converging into a morally fraught choice that feels inevitable yet costly. His micro-choice to cut the vine, not the violin, crystallizes his renunciation with tactile precision. The telepathic affliction and coffee-reading ritual are woven into his decision-making, not decorative traits. Final action trades imperial validation for fragile truth, earning Earned Stasis with palpable emotional and professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline—rooted in reverence, not grief—and her micro-choices (e.g., tightening fingers around the emerald at the precise emotional peak) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile and sensory precision (“cool and inert,” “liquid light”). The absence of secondary characters simplifies relational pressure but sharpens focus on her solitary ritual. Her endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: she forecloses oblivion’s totality by preserving one spark, at the cost of perpetual solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her worry, resolve, and epiphany feel earned through micro-choices (climbing, scalloping soil) rather than abstract reflection. Her contradiction between learned peace and yearning for joy drives every action. The hairpin functions as both heirloom and tool, revealing her lineage and agency. Final realization avoids diagnostic label-speak by rooting contentment in tactile participation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s internal fracture is rendered with precise physicality—the trembling hand, the fumbling clasp—and his shift from certainty to doubt feels earned through embodied contradiction, not epiphany. The narrator’s role as a “conscience for hire” refracts cleanly through his actions and calibrated speech. Both characters’ status dynamics (wealth vs. enigmatic authority) subtly shape their exchange without exposition. The final renunciation—shedding the fur cloak—is a micro-choice that crystallizes his reconfigured values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s impatience, embodied in tactile detail (“rough fabric... scraping”), collides with his desperate love for his sister, creating layered internal conflict. Elara’s paradoxical youth and ancient eyes are not just described but dramatized through her actions—her withholding, her smile, her vanishing life arc—which directly pressure Kael’s choices. The final micro-choice (“I see”) carries immense weight because it emerges from earned struggle, not epiphany. Both characters avoid diagnostic label-speak; their flaws (Kael’s insistence, Elara’s necessary secrecy) drive the narrative without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelan’s interiority is concrete and consistent—motivated by quiet reverence, embodied in tactile gestures (cracking leather, palm vibration), and culminating in a micro-choice (humming reassurance) that renounces intervention for guidance. The final act of psychic skimming feels earned through centuries of listening, with the cost being the surrender of detachment to emotional engagement. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his inadequacy, misalignment, and yearning for sacred simplicity feel specific, not archetypal. His micro-choice to unstrap the pack crystallizes his hierarchy of values with tangible cost: rejecting institutional validation for intuitive creation. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through sensory resonance (“gentle, pervasive warmth of a memory”). His flaws drive every beat without safety-hedging, making his Earned Stasis deeply credible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s motivation—rooted in grief, devotion, and a synesthetic vow—is embodied with precision: his micro-choices (checking gear as emotional armor, diving despite risk) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction thrums beneath stoic action (“This wasn't about grief; it was about physics”), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His epiphany feels earned because it arises from sensory immersion, not abstraction. The brass tag and cello memory anchor his flaw—relentless fidelity—as both strength and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—wavelength alignment with purpose—is idiosyncratic yet deeply embodied, driving every micro-choice from coin selection to power reallocation. His internal contradiction (prophet vs. madman) manifests physically through doubt and awe, not diagnostic labels. The final realization reconfigures his identity without sentimentality, foreclosing his original goal with resonant cost: he curates memory, not future. His “quiet enthusiasm” evolves organically into awe, grounded in tactile actions like handling the copper coin.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s grief is embodied with visceral specificity—his spectral fingers, the “physical amputation” of Elara’s absence—and his motivation intensifies through micro-choices (replaying recordings, using the prism) that reveal a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing sorrow through tactile rituals and cosmic metaphors rooted in his reaper identity. The final renunciation isn’t healing but naming, an Earned Stasis that forecloses oblivion with tangible cost: he accepts perpetual heartbreak to preserve her echo.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “brittle devotion,” exhaustion, and fragile hope are rendered through concrete action (conjuring water, adjusting drips) rather than diagnostic labels. His earnest naivete isn’t stated but shown in his ritualistic precision and unwavering return despite futility. The final smile carries earned cost: magic spent, body slumped, yet hope intact. His flaws drive the plot; his limits make the tiny victory feel monumental.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation evolves organically from inherited myth to moral duty, grounded in embodied detail (mud-sucking boots, archival ink).

The grandfather’s protective lie and Elias’s quiet correction reveal layered emotional stakes without diagnostic self-awareness. Final action earns closure with visible cost: confronting a community’s poisoned memory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—rigid logic versus yearning for intuitive synthesis—is embodied in precise, sensory-rich choices (abandoning alembics, opening the locket) rather than abstract summaries. His secret sentimentality isn’t labeled but revealed through the edelweiss and locket, driving his climactic act with visible emotional cost. The transformation feels earned because his micro-choices under pressure (observing starlings, applying flame beneath the leaf) reflect a hierarchy of values shifting in real time. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; wonder arrives as sensation, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in visceral memory and embodied ritual, not abstraction. His trembling hand and muscle-memory sequence reveal internal contradiction—fear versus discipline—without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—defeating numbness through creation—is consistent, embodied, and drives his climactic choice. His internal contradiction (void vs. phantom emotion) acts simultaneously during the vivification, not as alternating summaries. Jin functions effectively as secondary pressure, his fear revealing thematic stakes. The final tremor of responsibility is earned, with visible cost: the burden of a new consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent: his receptivity to mystery drives micro-choices (examining the box, consulting databases, symbolic reasoning). His emotional arc—from curiosity to ritualistic commitment—feels earned through embodied actions (pressing the seed into soil) rather than abstract reflection. The final act forecloses impatience with visible cost: years of tending a grotesque bloom. However, the internal contradiction (“maddening process of creation” vs. desire for control) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s mournfully eager nature manifests in embodied, contradictory actions—spectral yet tactile, desperate yet tender—and his motivation to restore laughter drives every micro-choice. His love is shown through the leaf blower as conduit, not stated abstractly. The wife and son react with credible emotional complexity, avoiding sentimentality. Final smile carries earned fragility, not forced resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyel’s interiority is vividly embodied—his feral nature, frozen grief, and homesickness manifest in tactile, sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (longing vs. duty, hope vs. suspicion) collide at the portal climax, where his renunciation feels earned by decades of endurance. The pendant’s temptation sharpens his internal conflict without oversimplifying it. His final choice carries visible cost: relinquishing a vision of home to preserve the library’s stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his stoicism masks a “frantic sensitivity” that manifests in embodied choices (chipping the crozier, discarding reagents). His shift from force to surrender feels earned, rooted in repeated failure and self-awareness. The contradiction between his calloused hands and yearning for creation drives every action. His final awe cracks his mask without melodrama, revealing cost through restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to find the beginning in every ending—is embodied through precise, high-stakes micro-choices under pressure, especially her defiant repurposing of the Hollywood star fragment. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion is conveyed through tactile perception (“cool and humming faintly in her palm”) and professional frustration. The final smile and log entry feel earned because they arise from a sequence of increasingly radical assumptions discarded under duress. Her flaw—obsessive abstraction—is confronted not with cure but with transformation into practical ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Finn’s resilient positivity is embodied through micro-choices—adjusting the radio, interpreting patterns—not declared. His motivation crystallizes believably from observation under pressure, and his final act carries conceptual cost: he becomes a permanent liminal figure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest as physical resonance (“hum in his bones”) and tactile focus (salt-stiffened jacket). The only near-slip is Captain Eva’s abrupt recovery, but Finn’s isolation preserves his arc’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—his fingers manipulating sinew thread, the hum beneath his skin—but his emotional arc leans slightly on conceptual abstraction (“texture of connection”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The shift in memory feels psychologically plausible, yet the final hollowness risks bordering on diagnostic label-speak without deeper irrationality or hypocrisy. His micro-choices (weaving the cold hand) are precise and costly, aligning motive with action under pressure. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation—rooted in professional duty and spiritual awe—is consistently embodied through tactile interactions (the chain link), algorithmic labor, and quiet defiance. His “balancedly curious” nature manifests as disciplined obsession, not fantasy, and his final choice carries the cost of institutional rejection. The internal conflict between pragmatism and cosmic yearning operates simultaneously in scene, especially during secret night work. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through pressure on tools, data, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Leo are vividly rendered through embodied emotion and micro-choices—Elias’s quiet professionalism, Leo’s slumped posture and choked speech—but their internal contradictions remain implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension. The grandson’s transformation feels earned, yet Elias’s own arc lacks a visible cost or renunciation; he exits unchanged, which limits the depth of his characterization under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak and stock phrasing, grounding emotion in tactile details (the hearing aid, the photograph). However, the absence of a personal stake or flaw for Elias prevents full 9+ status.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s claustrophobia, grief, and duty intertwine in embodied, contradictory impulses—his panic at the collapsed corridor clashes with his resolve to complete his grandmother’s work. His micro-choices (e.g., using the gold fleck, whispering equations) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act of placing the fleck is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost: peace through relinquishment, not rescue. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—her heartbeat counting both defies death and affirms life. Her micro-choices (using the shard, guiding ink) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by bureaucratic erasure and devotion to Aris. The porcelain shard isn’t just a relic but a tool that channels her agency. Her final reconfiguration—from ghost to meaning-maker—is earned through struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to translate texture into sound—is embodied in every sensory perception and culminates in a decisive, costly act. His copper-veined skin isn’t decorative; it’s the organ of his purpose, making his epiphany feel earned, not asserted. The trembling hands on the precipice reveal vulnerability beneath quiet articulation, grounding his near-mythic quest in human fragility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through vibration, grit, and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Julian’s interiority is vividly embodied—his bitterness, grief, and eventual reconfiguration feel earned through specific contradictions (e.g., craving a villain yet recognizing Clara’s peace). His final renunciation—choosing protection over exposure—is rooted in prior beats and carries tangible emotional cost. The flint arrowhead and phone function as crucibles that test his values under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from sensory immersion, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied—her pulse-synced violin technique reveals a character whose emotional and physical rhythms are inseparable from her mission. Her internal conflict (fear vs. hope) manifests in real-time choices under pressure, not summary. The final act of reclamation feels earned because her method evolves organically from experimentation to sacrifice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tendons, breath, and trembling strings.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—“to find where broken promises heal”—is embodied in precise, contradictory action: he risks everything to smuggle digital consciousness while avoiding physical transgression. His “respectfully rebellious” ethos manifests in micro-choices (mapping sensor voids, recorking the spent bottle) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is conveyed through grit on his uniform, the weight of the empty bottle, and the datapad’s blinking bluebird. The final endurance (“build it, one absence at a time”) earns Charged Poise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through tactile, sensory engagement rather than exposition; his silence feels earned, not decorative. His motivation—to interpret silence as possibility—is dramatized in micro-choices (e.g., carving new flourishes, installing wind bells) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final act of singing emerges organically from accumulated pressure, not epiphany, and carries the cost of vulnerability after a decade of muteness. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a yearning for narrative ontology that feels both eccentric and humanly plausible. His interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile handling of the scarf, precise book placement, and restrained emotional tremors—and avoids diagnostic or therapeutic phrasing. The story earns his quiet endurance (Earned Stasis) by showing micro-choices under pressure: folding the scarf after near-success, returning to his desk with resolve. However, the patrons remain too peripheral to test relational dynamics, limiting full expression of contradictory impulses beyond solitary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—capturing a runaway dream—is embodied through obsessive ritual and micro-choices (e.g., using spring water, not chemicals), revealing interior contradiction between hope and futility. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak; longing is conveyed via tactile detail (“hands trembled,” “aching void”). The final renunciation of pursuit for presence feels earned, with visible cost: years of solitude crystallized into quiet companionship. No secondary characters dilute focus, keeping pressure singular and intense.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Locksmith’s motivation—to free caged ideas—is consistent, quietly profound, and embodied in his actions rather than explained. His unassuming boldness manifests in the precise, resonant hum that dissolves fear’s structure, not through force but reconfiguration.

Both characters remain enigmatic yet emotionally legible, with micro-choices (e.g., holding hair to starlight) revealing values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—recovering stolen childhood memories—is vividly embodied through tactile rituals and a lifetime of disciplined observation. His chronic curiosity manifests as both trait and flaw, culminating in the tremulous violation of his own rule. The final choice feels earned: not impulsive, but the inevitable collapse of decades of restraint under unbearable emotional pressure. The micro-choice to touch the mushroom reconfigures his entire life’s work with palpable cost—caution sacrificed for a single, fragile truth.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s scarred embodiment, combative tenderness, and backward-walking tell reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic labels. Elara’s quiet strength emerges through micro-choices—flinching, then kneeling to restack scrolls—that reconfigure her relationship to exile. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure: his fear of repeating past failure fuels his harsh mentorship, while her resilience is shown as active rebuilding, not passive endurance. The final beat earns its emotional weight through embodied contradiction and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is vividly rooted in generational duty and sensory perception of fading wonder, with interiority rendered through embodied, poetic awareness rather than diagnostic labels. His “insatiably creative” trait directly informs his ritualistic method, distinguishing him from a “lesser guardian.” The final act—infusing the seed with captured essence—is earned by prior characterization and carries the cost of spiritual labor. No head-hopping or secondary characters dilute focus; micro-choices (e.g., choosing weaving over planting) reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s trembling hand and pale face embody his fear without diagnostic labels; the protagonist’s calm is shown through precise, tactile ritual rather than stated stoicism. Their relationship functions as crucible—Kaelen’s apprenticeship forces a transfer of burden that reconfigures their dynamic by story’s end.

No head-hopping, no therapy-speak, and emotional progression feels earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “shielded openness” and “methodical curiosity” manifest in tactile, profession-specific choices (e.g., comparing footage, annotating rather than repairing). Her motivation—to interpret silence with empathy—is dramatized through micro-choices that escalate under pressure, culminating in a resonant renunciation: she reframes the tear as a threshold instead of fixing it. The final annotation “threshold found” carries conceptual cost: she accepts the unknown rather than conquering it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise from concrete perception (“breath fogging,” “tremor of connection”).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and emotionally precise, especially in the final realization about "the physics of letting go." Their quietly analytic trait informs every action without slipping into diagnostic label-speak. The imagined presence of Mortimer adds subtle depth without violating single-POV constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to articulate Lyra’s unspoken loneliness—is embodied with exquisite specificity through micro-choices (slotting the bolt plate, guiding the light-beam) and interior contradiction: calm focus shadowed by dread of failure. His emotional arc avoids therapy-speak; feelings manifest via tactile detail (“metal now warm to the touch”) and ritualized action. The final smile carries earned cost—temporary communion against entropic decay—not tidy resolution. Flaws are implicit in his fragile hope, never safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—his “warmly inquisitive” nature manifests in tactile choices (handling the diary, using the goggles) rather than abstract longing. His micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values: loyalty over curiosity, protection over revelation. The final renunciation—tucking the sketch away—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; grief and hope coexist without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—memorializing Lena through cloud categorization—is deeply rooted in his identity as a meteorologist and lover, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (naming clouds, not logging the final one) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost: surrendering scientific objectivity for emotional truth. Interiority is embodied (“voice a dry rustle,” “cold certainty”) and avoids therapy-speak. The final renunciation—stopping his work—is earned by prior causality and crystallizes his transformation from castaway to curator.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the core of her perception and artistry, grounding her motivation and method. Her tactile sensitivity and emotional embodiment—especially in reading “the pattern of their anxieties”—are concrete and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply embodied and consistent—her ache for repair pulses through tactile details like “water-smoothed wood” and the warm clockmaker’s tools against frigid air. Her internal conflict (desire to fix vs. fear of failure) manifests in micro-choices: averting her gaze, trusting touch over sight. The final act—using a gear as a key—is earned by lineage, prophecy, and emotional buildup. No diagnostic label-speak; her transformation feels lived-in, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characters are distinct through action and speech—Kaelen’s cynicism versus Elara’s fragile faith—and their micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchies of value. Anya’s lightness becomes tactical, not just descriptive. The ghost’s motivation is clear but remains external; its influence lacks internal contradiction or struggle, limiting depth. No diagnostic label-speak or gestural poverty, though secondary characters operate more as functional roles than fully individuated selves.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—whispering a lullaby across lifetimes—is rooted in embodied memory and consistent flaw (his bruised awe). His internal contradiction (arrogance vs. humility) acts simultaneously during the climax, not as summary but through tactile choices: holding the puppet, translating the melody. The final renunciation (sacrificing his essence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—his fading breath, slumped posture. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through wood grain, crystal hum, and fractured song.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in weary obligation, not heroism; his internal contradiction—cynicism versus stubborn compassion—is embodied in tactile detail (“weary resignation,” “stubborn spark”). His micro-choices (retrieving the box, assembling without touch) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: exhaustion traded for one more life saved. The final renunciation—disassembling the spent beacon—earns Earned Stasis with quiet dignity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his grief is a “tight, hard knot” that “loosens” into hope, not therapy-speak. His professional lens (“symphonically minded,” polymer chemist) shapes perception without overriding emotional truth. The final micro-choice—to write a letter celebrating divergence, not apologizing—feels earned by his river-foam insight. His flaw (demanding rigidity) directly caused the rift and now informs his growth.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—obsessive, rooted in existential doubt—drives every action with escalating stakes. His internal contradiction (selling beginnings while doubting their origin) is embodied in tactile choices: measuring silence, incising the tree. The climax is earned by prior causality: his dissatisfaction compels the wound that births possibility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in glass, moonlight, and scar.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to sandpaper memories smooth—is embodied in tactile, sensory choices (tasting the fossil, digging bare-handed) and contradicted by his deepening immersion in sorrow rather than escape. His final act of subsuming grief is earned through consistent interior logic and micro-choices that escalate stakes. The Warlord functions as a crucible: their relationship shifts from burden to quiet warmth, with Kaelen’s touch at the end showing transformed perception. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through grit, brine, and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his role and creed, with interiority rendered through embodied action—his “empathetically decisive” trait shapes key choices under pressure. The final calibration of the dial reflects a hierarchy of values (connection over control) with visible cost: exhaustion, emotional exposure, and the burden of solitude. His competence is balanced by struggle; he doesn’t overpower the chaos but coaxes harmony from it. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution—his endurance feels earned, not heroic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s helix-minded cognition manifests in embodied contradictions—her chaotic precision, her grief for lost dreams countered by fierce preservation—and culminates in a micro-choice (absorbing the composer’s dream) that reconfigures her identity with tangible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through sensory immersion (“taste of a chef’s undiscovered spice blend”) and recursive thought patterns. The final tear-and-smile embodies Earned Stasis: she endures self-dissolution to become a vessel, foreclosing ordinary existence. Motivation intensifies coherently from archaeologist to inheritor.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is consistent and compelling—his prism-mind refracts knowledge into action, and his internal conflict (duty vs. danger) manifests in embodied choices, not summaries. His micro-decisions (aligning doodle with fungi, launching from the wall) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his emotional state remains slightly abstracted in peak stress (“panic, cold and sharp”) without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final renunciation (carrying the burden alone) is earned but lacks a sharper personal cost beyond implied isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—creating music in a silent world—is embodied with visceral specificity and drives every micro-choice. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile perception (e.g., “silence was a weight… in her bones”). The final act of listening, not performing, reveals a subtle but earned shift: she no longer imposes but receives. Her flaw—initially forcing melody rather than releasing it—is confronted through the Old One’s stress cracks, yielding a resonant renunciation with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelan’s motivation—to find beauty in difficulty—is embodied through tactile ritual (the worry stone), precise methodology, and emotional restraint. His internal contradiction (exile vs. awe) resolves not in redemption but in earned stasis: acceptance of displacement as a site of discovery. The tear “born not of sorrow, but of awe” avoids diagnostic label-speak and grounds epiphany in sensory perception. His final renunciation—letting the stone fall—carries visible cost and reconfigures his identity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—cataloging silence as a path to empathy—is deeply rooted in his identity as an eclectic pacifist and consistently embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices. His internal conflict (desire to access the diary vs. respect for privacy) manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous, contradictory impulses resolved through action. The final renunciation—leaving the diary unread—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost: he gains understanding without violating trust. His intuitively descriptive attribute is flawlessly integrated into his worldview and tactics, never lapsing into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s ambition, sensory vulnerability, and internal conflict are rendered with exquisite specificity. Her contradictory impulses—desire for control versus surrender to chaos—act simultaneously during the windstorm climax. The final choice to anchor in stillness is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in sensory pain and emotional exposure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied via scent, breath, and tactile focus.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, urgent, and embodied—her desperation to save the orchards fuels precise micro-choices (e.g., using the inverted river, deploying the drone). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; her emotion is conveyed through tactile perception (“humming resonated in her teeth”) and action under pressure. The relic’s pull and the seed pod’s transformation reveal character through interaction, not exposition. Her final choice—securing the shard—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of racing a collapsing window.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s motivation is rooted in a precise, character-specific obsession—cultivating foresight through atmospheric data—that drives every action. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied in tactile detail (“haze tasted of salt and rust,” “weight heavier than all the steel”). The discovery of the patch triggers a credible, high-stakes pivot, and his final realization carries the cost of isolation and futility. His flaw—hyper-rational detachment—is consistent and shapes both competence and emotional void.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline—“to certify wonder as essential”—and embodied through precise, synesthetic action. His internal state (“oscillating repose”) mirrors the world’s condition and evolves credibly into active creation. Every gesture aligns with his role; the final stillness is earned endurance, not passivity. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in failure, not abstract guilt, and his micro-choices—kneeling, arranging wood, untying the case—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“shard of ice in his gut”) and contradictory (reverence vs. dissection). The final insight feels earned because it emerges from tactile interaction with the flute and driftwood, not introspection alone. His flaw—misunderstanding guardianship as defense rather than harmony—directly caused Elara’s loss and now shapes his penitent method.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand emotion as mathematics—is consistently embodied in his actions and speech, never reduced to exposition. Anya’s grief is rendered through specific physicality (clutching the photo, trembling hands) rather than diagnostic labels. Their interaction reveals contradictory impulses: Elias borrows her sorrow yet remains detached; Anya seeks relief but receives only recontextualization. The final micro-choice—Anya stepping into newborn stars with the card—carries visible emotional cost and credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s jittery anxiety and yearning for routine feel embodied and specific, not diagnostic. His internal conflict—between fear and the call to wonder—is dramatized through tactile reactions (chapped knuckles, trembling fingers) and micro-choices (clutching the pouch, pausing on the ridge). The transformation at the end feels earned because his stillness emerges from direct confrontation with Elara’s memory and the pendant’s magic, not abstract epiphany. However, Elara’s absence limits relational pressure, and Kael’s flaw lacks a costly mistake that compounds—his passivity is consistent but never actively jeopardizes the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his mysticism clashes with scientific rigor, and his grief is filtered through tactile obsession. His final renunciation of poetic memory for mechanical truth is earned by prior causality and carries visceral cost. The prism’s revelation forces a credible endurance that forecloses his sacred narrative. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action, posture, and precise sensory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in embodied loss—each thread woven costs a sensory memory, making her sacrifice visceral and specific. Her internal contradiction (love vs. erasure) operates simultaneously in every action, especially when she falters at the void where his name used to be. The final choice to weave the locking threads is earned through relentless micro-sacrifices, culminating in Earned Stasis with profound cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail like “the scent of his hair after a rainstorm” becoming thread.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—his barter of sensory memories feels both mythic and humanly specific.

The loss he experiences is immediate and irreversible, grounding his sacrifice in visceral cost. His contradiction—gentle hands in a brutal trade—fuels every action without veering into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in grief, curiosity, and familial silence—is embodied through sensory detail and micro-choices (e.g., holding the shard, sifting layers) that escalate under pressure.

The final datalog entry reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through concrete perception (“air tasted clean, neutral”).

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—rooted in quiet routine, unspoken intimacy, and the need to “bottle the feeling of safety”—is embodied with precision and deepens under pressure. His internal contradiction (desire for connection vs. reticence) manifests physically through stone-stacking and pocketed sea glass. The final act of repairing the lamp and building the farewell circle reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile, specific, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelan’s motivation—shaping dawn from ancient shadows—is vividly embodied in his manic laughter, physical tremors, and precise manipulation of the wick. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through action (“laughter became a gale,” “body trembling with exhaustion”). The final quiet chuckle reveals earned complexity: creator shaped by creation. However, his flaw lacks concrete prior contradiction—it reads more as ecstatic obsession than layered internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his dye-master perception filters every observation, and his curiosity evolves into a quiet obsession grounded in embodied sensation (“steam from her cup curled into questioning shapes”). His motivation intensifies credibly from passive wonder to active investigation, culminating in a confrontation that feels both vulnerable and inevitable. The donor heart isn’t just a plot device but a visceral catalyst for reoriented attention, and his final realization emerges from accumulated micro-choices (studying the wing, tracking light) rather than epiphany. The woman remains enigmatic yet legible through his lens, avoiding stereotype while applying precise pressure to his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation—to witness what trees feel—is embodied in his meticulous, sorrow-laden craft, not merely stated. His internal contradiction (duty vs. obsession) manifests through micro-choices: handling the shard with tweezers, angling the sextant just so. Emotion is rendered physically—the chill of despair, the warmth of resolution—avoiding diagnostic abstraction. His final act of placing the shard into the mosaic enacts Earned Stasis: he accepts grief’s permanence without fixing it, foreclosing any illusion of cure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as memory keeper, and her fractured interiority is embodied through sensory perception (“mind was a shattered reflection,” “melody bloomed… like the color yellow”). Her micro-choices—tending flora to retrieve song fragments—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the burden of sole responsibility for a dying realm. The final act of singing is earned by prior causality, and her emotional arc intertwines flawlessly with the external stakes. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s compassionate reclusiveness and empathetic overload are embodied with precise, character-specific contradictions—his fear of gatherings versus craving connection feels lived-in, not diagnostic. His micro-choices (crumpling then smoothing the invitation, choosing concealment over flight) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation isn’t reversal but recalibration: shelter needn’t be empty. Elara’s presence functions as mirror, not catalyst, keeping focus on Elias’s internal logic without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a consistent, embodied grief for erasure, and her micro-choices—planting herbs, offering the bread heel—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The patrolman’s brief but potent interior shift (“My mother waited in line…”) avoids stereotype through specific memory. Both characters act from blind spots (Elara’s hoarding as futile preservation, the patrolman’s duty vs. nostalgia), and their interaction crystallizes without tidy resolution. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion lives in tactile detail (“joints stiff from the cold,” “fossil from a forgotten age”).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is crystalline and embodied: his “gently meticulous touch” and desperate tuning of the resonator reveal a man whose flaws (perfectionism, obsession) enable his purpose yet exact emotional cost. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels—emotion manifests through fogged breath, flying fingers, and the plume of white vapor. The final renunciation (“another vow was logged”) is earned by prior causality and carries the weight of irrevocable loss. His contradiction—futility versus fidelity—is active in every beat, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—capturing “the sound of trust breaking”—is vividly embodied and drives three escalating attempts, each revealing her resourcefulness and emotional stakes. Her internal contradiction (desire for truth vs. loyalty to family legacy) manifests physically through micro-choices: the hip nudge, the appeal to Boro, the oilskin bribe. The final confrontation shows credible endurance rather than triumph, with visible cost in her isolation and the warmth of the recorder as sole reward. Silas and Eva function effectively as pressure points without over-explaining their backstories.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s skepticism is embodied through precise sensory perception and micro-choices—twisting the compass ring, tasting atmospheric shifts—that reveal her scientific rigor clashing with lived mystery. Her internal contradiction (need for proof vs. awe at convergence) culminates in a credible, earned reconfiguration: not abandoning inquiry but redefining its map. The carriers’ silent recognition mirrors her own shift without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through ozone tang and lavender calm.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—between photorealistic replication and suppressed creative chaos—is embodied in his charcoal-stained hands and precise lock manipulation. His motivation stems from a consistent, painful flaw: trading vision for coin. The final choice to embrace Anya’s tools is earned by years of failure and a single, tactile breakthrough. Cost is visible in the tear cutting through grime—a physical trace of emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation—yearning for lost candor—is rooted in consistent traits (calligrapher, heirloom fern) and intensifies credibly through his obsession with the map. His final choice to plant the Veritas seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: abandoning passive craftsmanship for active cultivation in a dishonest world. Interiority is concrete (“sweet poison on the recycled air,” “quiet obsession”) without diagnostic label-speak. The fern’s wilting provides embodied emotional feedback, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is embodied in every precise movement and silent choice, avoiding abstraction. His seasonal muteness isn’t decorative; it’s the condition enabling his craft.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail: “song thrumming faintly against his palms,” “head tilted back.”

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The android’s interiority is vividly embodied—nostalgia as “static,” warmth as a “glitch”—and its motivation intensifies credibly under pressure. Contradictory impulses (caretaker duty vs. self-liberation) act simultaneously during the climax, and the final choice to miniaturize Elara’s fear crystallizes its emergent personhood. The emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, terror and courage manifest through sensory overload (“processors scream”) and tactile focus (“cool to the touch”). The cost—abandoning the curated garden for an uncertain desert—is felt in the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in a quiet belief that “listening heals what force can only break”—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile detail (e.g., thumb on locket) and spatial stillness. Secondary characters apply immediate, relevant pressure without crowding the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her dance as cognition, her tactile engagement with the dice, and her emotional arc from isolation to quiet communion feel earned and specific. Her motivation—to encrypt vulnerability as strength—is dramatized through micro-choices (e.g., choosing surrender over control) that carry visible cost. The mother-daughter dynamic, though off-page, functions as a crucible because every action reclaims fractured memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through gesture, rhythm, and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation is rooted in visceral loss, not abstraction—his grief is embodied through the wildflower book and tactile ritual. His contradictory impulses (desperate hope vs. quiet endurance) act simultaneously during the memory retrieval.

No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to hush, not unmake—is exquisitely specific and rooted in her identity as a guardian of quiet. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied through tactile focus (“cool and heavy like river stone”) and ritualized action.

Contradictory impulses—calm intensity, cosmic power wielded gently—are active throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s motivation—to fluently interpret the language of old buildings—is embodied through tactile, sensory engagement rather than abstract yearning. Her internal conflict between curiosity and complicity in “agreed upon lies” manifests in micro-choices: knocking on Elias’s door, accepting cold tea, pressing the seal into rooftop soil. Elias’s quiet resistance and eventual revelation feel earned because his restraint mirrors the building’s own reticence. The final renunciation of illusion for truth carries visible cost: the end of their ritualized denial.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior conflict—skepticism versus longing—is embodied with precision (“charmed skeptic,” “longing was a stronger force”) and drives micro-choices (pressing the shell harder, refusing to pull back). His emotional arc from hollow isolation to wholeness is earned through concrete sensory reclamation, not abstract epiphany. The trauma backstory is tightly bound to present action via the seashell and resonance structures. However, the final tear leans slightly toward performative closure rather than fully subsumed embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—forgiving the unfinished—is embodied in precise, costly action rather than abstract longing. His internal conflict (loyalty vs. liberation) manifests through micro-choices: the thorn’s use, the ink’s age, the breath before the dot.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss and philosophical inquiry, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“breath was a quiet mist,” “shard of glass in her heart”). Her micro-choices—each sung note as a key—reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, completion over lingering. The final renunciation of endless questioning for active song-finishing is earned by the causal progression of echoes and shell whispers. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises from sensory contradiction (sorrow vs. clarity) without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—salvaging purity from wreckage—is embodied in her trance work and micro-choices, especially her refusal to accuse but instead weave truth through dream-images. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile details (e.g., candlelight dipping “as if holding their breath”). The boy’s final smile and release feel earned because Elara’s method aligns with her flaw: indirect confrontation that risks failure. Cost is felt in the melted globe’s transformation from prison to memorial.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile, profession-rooted metaphors (nets, tea whisk) that ground his philosophical yearning in concrete action. His motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is consistent and embodied, culminating in the whistle as a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values: participation over mastery. The absence of other characters simplifies relational pressure but intensifies the internal contradiction between observer and participant. His quiet endurance at the end constitutes Earned Stasis with legible cost: he accepts his smallness without despair.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—excavating truth from myth—is embodied through precise micro-choices: reassembling shredded letters, testing the diamond’s optical properties, rejecting superstition for empirical method. Their internal contradiction (skepticism vs. awe) surfaces subtly in the final moment of quiet reverence for physical law. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through professional rigor and tactile observation. The renunciation of easy myth for harder truth carries conceptual cost without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—shaping a new dawn from ancient shadows—is vividly embodied in his micro-choices: etching prophecies, broadcasting interpretations, rejecting spectral masters. His internal conflict between variant allegiances manifests as simultaneous pulls rather than alternating summaries, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses both offered futures with visible cost. The lacquered chest’s opening feels earned, not convenient, because his prior endurance under pressure primes the moment. No diagnostic label-speak mars his crisis; panic is “cold and sharp,” regret “tastes of ozone.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vagrant poet’s motivation—“to become the translator between generations”—is embodied through consistent, tactile actions (collecting sounds, composing a symphony for the music box) rather than abstract yearning. His internal contradiction (longing to preserve loss while accepting its transience) manifests in micro-choices: not repairing the box but giving it “a new song.” The final act—placing a seashell as “grace note”—reveals a hierarchy of values (resonance over restoration) with visible cost: his solitude remains, yet is transfigured into connection.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” duality is embodied through concrete micro-choices—filing away dread, enduring molecular realignment—and her competence is balanced by visceral struggle. Her motivation to protect the Siren’s Heart is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The interiority avoids diagnostic labels (“cold knot of dread” is sensory, not clinical), though the phrase “logically emotional” risks abstraction but is immediately dramatized. Final endurance carries visible cost: sweat-soaked trembling in sub-zero air.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s internal conflict—impatience versus cultivated patience—is embodied in visceral, character-specific language (“wild animal clawing at her ribs”) and drives every micro-choice. Her final act of restraint is earned by months of disciplined observation, and the cost (suppressed fury, generational burden) is legible in her trembling hand and still chest. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, tool use, and sensory detail. The closure renunciation (not rage but watchfulness) forecloses a path with profound personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his empirical rigor wars with involuntary empathy, embodied in tactile reactions to the lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arthur’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his guilt, futility, and yearning for efficacy clash without tidy resolution. Elias’s transformation from prisoner to craftsman is shown through tactile behavior and voice, not exposition. Their micro-choices (Arthur bringing the heart, Elias refusing to “fix” it) reveal hierarchies of value with palpable cost. The final renunciation—Arthur relinquishing repair for witness—is earned by prior causality and charged with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)

Her internal contradiction—truth-seeking versus survival—manifests in the pivotal lie to Kael, a micro-choice with high stakes. Emotions are embodied (“heart hammered,” “trembling hands”) without therapy-speak, and her flaw (relentless fixation) directly enables both her discovery and vulnerability. The final renunciation of passive searching for active exposure feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara and Jorn’s motivations are rooted in trauma and fear, not malice, and Kael’s empathy-driven intervention reveals their inner contradictions with precision. Emotions are embodied—Mara’s rigid anger, Jorn’s silent shock—and Kael’s micro-choices (drawing the quartz, entering the lighthouse) align with his role as mediator. The backstory of Mara’s past loss is concretely anchored and alters present perception without therapy-speak. However, Jorn’s interiority remains slightly underexplored beyond relief, limiting full contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory, embodied, and specific. Her motivation (to learn the sound of endings) drives every micro-choice, from sifting debris to clutching the parasol tip. The final renunciation isn’t impatience for death but for comprehension, making her epiphany feel earned, not diagnostic. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and weighted silence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)

His contradictory impulses (fierce love vs. need for understanding) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in a renunciation that feels earned. The micro-choice to reframe the burned letter as preservation, not spite, reveals a hierarchy of values with palpable emotional cost. No safety-hedging: his flaws directly caused the rupture, and his growth accepts that truth without redemption fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—preserving the prophet’s undistorted wisdom—and his “strangely honest” trait directly fuels his pivotal action. His interiority is concrete (“mind settling into whisperfield calm”) and embodied (mask cool against cheek, gait against sand). The story avoids diagnostic label-speak and shows contradiction through quiet resistance to group distortion rather than internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)

His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, grounding emotion in embodied observation (e.g., tracing arcs in slumped shoulders). However, his lack of internal contradiction or struggle borders on idealized; the story presents healing as frictionless, which slightly undercuts the "genuine flaw" requirement. The renunciation of anonymity (his work unseen by the town) carries quiet cost but feels more poetic than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s reticence, scholarly obsession, and physical embodiment (“joints complaining,” “wrinkled skin”) fuse into a coherent, specific interiority. His shift from cataloguer to oracle feels earned through micro-choices: kneeling, listening, renouncing publication. The final stance—silent testimony—is a credible endurance that forecloses legacy-making with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile engagement with the crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s precognitive forgetting is not just a trait but the engine of his tragic arc—his internal contradiction (knowing yet unable to retain) manifests physically in his desperate, failing search. His micro-choice to draw a circle instead of the lost sigil is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values: presence over possession. Emotion is embodied (“vibration in his teeth,” “pressure behind his eyes”) without therapy-speak. The flaw directly causes the climax’s cost—his life’s work dissolves because he cannot remember it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief and the desire to “harness the ephemeral”—is embodied through precise micro-choices (sacrificing the lens, timing the insertion by lunar zenith) that feel inevitable yet costly. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests via tactile focus (“listening for something no one else could hear”) and physical stillness amid chaos. The luminous ache ties past loss to present action without exposition, and his final renunciation—freezing time at the cost of all future moments—constitutes Earned Stasis with profound emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “decisively kind” force, micro-choices like brewing oolong, and professional restraint reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Mr. Aris and Lena are rendered through precise physical detail and emotional subtext, not exposition. The tear tracing into white hair crystallizes decades of silence without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in post-spoon-bend epistemological crisis—is consistently embodied through precise, tactile actions (e.g., relearning ‘inversion’ as ‘inside out’). Her internal contradiction between obsessive control and surrender to cosmic fluidity manifests in micro-choices: not turning the key but pushing it inward. The final stylus movement reveals enduring curiosity as both flaw and virtue, with cost implied in her isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through gesture and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: his rational skepticism wars with a yearning for his wife’s belief, embodied in tactile details (dirt on his cheek, the trowel’s weight). His “shrewdly innocent gaze” isn’t a label—it shapes how he misreads grief as hysteria, making his later fracture feel inevitable. The tooth forces a reckoning that reconfigures his entire worldview, not just his opinion. His final act—mapping a constellation around the tooth—is a micro-choice that crystallizes his transformation with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in trauma and longing, embodied through tactile detail (salt-stained fingers, sea glass) and micro-choices (polishing as renunciation of fire). Her internal conflict—between earthbound limitation and celestial yearning—is rendered without diagnostic language, using sensory memory instead. The final act of creation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her isolation and rejection of destructive light. A minor deduction for slightly idealized emotional calibration under stress.

    Elara’s “watchful dreamer” nature manifests in embodied, specific choices—tending moss, adjusting humidity, offering tea—that reveal her hierarchy of care without therapy-speak. Kaelen’s resignation is rendered through tactile detail (gaze fixed on fiber optics) rather than summary. Their final exchange hinges on contradictory impulses: his desire to disappear versus her quiet insistence on possibility. The pendant transfer earns his shift because it emerges from established behavior, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his despair, shame, and yearning are rendered through tactile sensations (the seashell’s edge), not diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses—to flee vs. face his failures—act simultaneously in scene, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses his old authorial identity with visible cost. The micro-choice to kneel and bury the shell crystallizes his hierarchy of values: honoring lost hopes over salvaging his career. No safety-hedging; his flaws directly cause his spiritual bankruptcy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation is deeply rooted in his identity as both tinkerer and keeper of lost traditions, and his internal tension—between whimsy and sacred duty—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., adjusting a dissonant note like a gear).

The final renunciation (returning to wait) reads as Earned Stasis, foreclosing personal relief for ongoing duty. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s motivation—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is both poetic and concrete, driving every micro-choice without sentimentality. His peripherally focused perception manifests in embodied action (tracking reflections, not the sunbeam), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation isn’t explicit but implied through Earned Stasis: he completes the work knowing the world may never reclaim these echoes, a cost felt in his quiet vigil. No internal contradiction is overstated; his competence is balanced by genuine struggle over weeks of monochrome labor.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—collecting and transmuting burdens—is consistent, embodied through tactile ritual, and reveals interior contradiction: he is both warden and prisoner, healer and sufferer. His micro-choices (aligning starlight, placing the stone) carry moral weight without over-explanation. The grief shard’s transformation reflects his own trapped state, deepening character through action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered via sensory precision (“shivering, grey light,” “creaking joints”).

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief is parceled, practical, and tactile. Her micro-choice to carve an “arc of profound stillness” rather than a lion or face reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in Leo’s lesson.

The final act of carving enacts Earned Stasis: she forecloses memorializing his presence in favor of preserving his wisdom, with cost legible in the silence after the kettle screams.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his regret coexists with pride, ambition with remorse—and his final admission (“My ambition broke it”) emerges organically from embodied memory triggered by the camera wheel. The ghost isn’t a gimmick but a dramatization of his unresolved self, and the integration (not exorcism) feels earned. His micro-choice to pocket the wheel signals acceptance, not escape, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory recall and tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)

The final renunciation of tidy hope for active reconfiguration feels earned, though the lack of interpersonal pressure limits relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between silenced ambition and monastic resignation—is rendered with visceral specificity: ink-stained fingers, unvoiced bells, the “crushing weight” transformed into “foundational stone.” His renunciation is earned through two decades of embodied suppression, not declared. The final act of arranging the bells as a “silent constellation” crystallizes his hierarchy of values: honoring the dream without reviving it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in a deeply personal quest, and his interiority is rendered through precise, embodied reactions—trailing fingers in bruised water, trembling hands opening the journal. His final realization emerges not as epiphany but as earned reconfiguration of inherited shame into protective sacrifice.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile struggle and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his patience, tactile engagement with the rope, and reverence for lost knowledge feel lived-in rather than declared. His internal conflict is subtle but present: the tension between preservation and comprehension, between stillness and action.

However, the absence of external pressure or relational friction limits the demonstration of contradictory impulses under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation (“to understand the geography of healing”) isn’t stated abstractly but enacted through ritual and perception. The final choice—to write her obituary as a testament to navigation, not loss—is earned by the projection sequence and carries emotional cost: he endures solitude to honor another’s retreat. No diagnostic label-speak; grief, hope, and resolution emerge through sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is vividly embodied—his frayed robes, trembling hands, and obsessive methodology reveal a psyche consumed by longing and doubt. His internal contradiction (desire for organic purity vs. reliance on mechanical means) drives every micro-choice, especially his rejection of synthetic glue in favor of lichen resin. The flawed genesis of the egg forces him to confront his idealism, culminating in Earned Stasis: he accepts the hybrid creature not as failure but as revelation. His emotional degradation under sleepless strain feels authentic, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “luminous skeptic” duality drives every micro-choice, especially her hands rotating the box while her soul trembles—a precise embodiment of contradictory impulses. Her motivation is rooted in a “quiet, sharp ache,” not abstraction, and her realistically imaginative mindset shapes her interpretation of the box as machine, not magic. The final renunciation isn’t stated but felt: her work’s defiant hush ends not with triumph but listening—proof earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Xylar’s motivation—breaking a cycle of sacrificial renewal—is rooted in deeply embodied sorrow and ancestral memory, not abstract idealism. The internal conflict between inherited duty and sentimental resistance manifests concretely through the shift from mapping echoes to broadcasting feeling.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through cosmic metaphor that remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests through tactile engagement with fabric, stone, and memory. His motivation intensifies credibly from personal loss to a quest for collective meaning. The contradiction between his solitude and yearning for connection fuels every micro-choice.

His internal conflict—between containment and release—is dramatized in the climactic vision, not summarized. The rake handle inscriptions function as micro-choices that accumulate moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in cultural stewardship, not mere survival, and his internal conflict—between condemning old ways or condemning all to extinction—is rendered through embodied tension (“frantic pulse,” “weight of a kingdom balanced on the fine point of the nib”). His “groundedly imaginative” trait actively shapes tactics (e.g., adjacent possible adaptations) and culminates in a Charged Poise closure where cost is felt but not yet paid. The kingfisher quill functions as both metaphor and catalyst, revealing his hierarchy of values: innovation over comfort, legacy over ease.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)

The child’s intrusion tests his stance, revealing hierarchy of values: memory over persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)

The choir members remain lightly sketched but serve as a collective crucible; their pressure is clear even without individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s involuntary truthfulness and yearning to preserve wonder manifest in concrete, contradictory impulses—his compulsion to speak truth wars with his desire to make others earn it. His micro-choice to give Lena a riddle instead of the box reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he risks obscurity to restore meaning.

Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion manifests via tactile details like the orris root shard. The final realization reframes her mission without epiphanic neatness, preserving contradiction: she seeks to “wake” houses but actually disrupts human routines.

Her motivation shifts credibly from righteous certainty to aching clarity, driven by cascading realizations that feel earned, not epiphanic.

His internal conflict—between hope and dread—is embodied in physical actions: trembling fingers, sun-baked certainty, breath poured into melody.

    Elias’s interior contradiction—“furiously tranquil”—is embodied in trembling hands, rhythmic ticking, and storm-lit stillness, never reduced to diagnostic labels.

His contradiction (violence of past vs. quiet reconstruction) operates simultaneously without exposition. Elara functions as a pressure-bearing mirror, not just support; their shared history informs micro-choices like the coffee tin ritual. The final offer of the poem crystallizes his renunciation of isolation with visible cost: vulnerability before strangers.

    Elian’s motivation—defiantly rewriting fate through a film-scored composition—is rooted in consistent, embodied longing and sharpened by loss. His “strategically creative” trait manifests not as label but as concrete action: translating celluloid glitches into dissonant chords that forge a path. The final step through the doorway is earned by prior causality (studying flaws, memorizing stutters) and carries visible cost: abandoning piano, arbor, and the frozen clock. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; grief has calcified into steely resolve, shown through tactile choices (unspooling film, playing “the film,” not a lament).

    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her doubt “flickers” then softens into a “luminous glow,” her empirical mindset clashes with the island’s whimsy, and her final act of faith feels earned. Her micro-choice to harmonize dreams rather than dissect them reveals a hierarchy of values (intuition over analysis) with visible cost: relinquishing control. The emotional progression—from panic to quiet certainty—is layered with contradiction and avoids tidy resolution.

    Kenji’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests through tactile ritual (shears, lace, compass), not therapy-speak. His contradictory impulses (yearning for absolution vs. fear of confronting guilt) act simultaneously in scene. The final micro-choice—to resume pruning with softened regret—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No safety-hedging; his flaws (stubborn silence, self-isolation) directly shape his arc.
