    Liora's character is established through concrete details (glass artist, scars on wrists, the ledger strip) and her "steadily adaptive" nature is mentioned but not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The confrontation with Jaren provides a moment of agency, but her internal conflict between seeking understanding and self-preservation remains largely told rather than shown through embodied struggle. The backstory of the fire and suicide attempt is substantial but anchored to present investigation; however, the final choice to keep the ledger feels inevitable rather than costly—no visible path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior is largely emblematic—"silence into music," "weight of failure"—rather than contradictory and embodied. The "silently expressive" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment forces a choice between his communicative limits and his goals. Liora has steady amber emotions and supportive function but no pressure that tests Elias. The tuning-fork strike at closure feels willed rather than earned by prior contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The undertaker's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout ("legs heavy with the weight of what he was about to do," "hands no longer trembling"). His arc from trembling hesitation to steady purpose is earned through specific micro-choices: packing, wading, reading aloud. However, the trait "inadvertently stubborn" is mentioned once but never dramatized as a constraint or trade-off that complicates a choice. The final transformation feels clean but lacks the contradictory impulse acting in scene that would elevate to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is consistently grounded in concrete action—tracing tiles, ringing bells, carrying baskets—and her trait of gentle persistence shows through micro-choices across beats. The children and elderly are present but functional rather than fully drawn. Internal contradiction is minimal; her stance of endurance through memory and ritual never wavers, which fits the Accumulative design but limits dramatic tension within her arc. Embodied emotion is adequate ("breath catching," fingers brushing cool surface) though some moments lean toward summary ("the weight of every decision").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lien's motivation—finding where unused love is stored—drives her actions, but the answering moment feels abstract rather than embodied. The memory of her past life as a woman with ink-stained fingers is introduced with vivid specificity, yet her present-self agency is largely observational until the final beat. The father's emotional arc is compressed and told through summary ("the look of a father who had tried everything"), undercutting the earned quality of the resolution. The final insight—love stored in the act of giving it away—arrives as a stated epiphany rather than a choice Lien makes under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to fix the time-loop is clearly rooted in her grief over lost family, and her final choice to press the fragment to her mother's chest carries visible cost—she loses the fragment and the woman. Interiority is vivid in the opening beats ("she had never thought it would unravel so visibly, so *personally*"), but the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final act; no contradictory impulses complicate her decision to use the fragment. The child/daughter thread introduces confusion: the photograph shows "her daughter," but the street scene reveals "her mother" holding a bundle stolen by time "before she could be born"—this genealogical knot is never clarified on the page, weakening causality and flattening what should be the story's most charged relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is established through embodied detail (raw wrists, chain weight) and her understanding of the key puzzle shows intelligence under pressure. Vey remains more opaque—his actions are competent but his interior is largely absent, reducing him to functional liberator archetype. The final moment where chains feel "lighter...as if the weight of hope had already begun to unravel them" drifts into abstraction rather than earned embodiment. The choice to take seeds is framed but lacks internal conflict or visible cost that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" is established through both his grandfather's legacy and his wife's lie, embodying the goal in personal betrayal. The cancer adds physical urgency, though the bodily experience of terminal illness remains abstract—we get "scars on his fingers" but little embodied degradation under that pressure. The final smile and "it was something" suggest acceptance, but the path from bitterness (the wife's "sharp, brittle green" lie) to satisfied closure feels compressed; the intervening emotional labor is told rather than shown in contradictory impulses. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("he believed in the things people left behind") rather than moment-by-moment sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's arc from thief to co-creator shows trajectory, but her transformation feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The moment she stops feeling like a thief arrives as assertion ("for the first time, Lira didn't feel like she was stealing anything") without prior dramatized struggle between stealing and creating. Kael remains functionally flat—his "quietly savvy" trait and poet/spy duality are told labels that never constrain a choice or create friction. The jar's glow and the rose exchange carry symbolic weight but don't force Lira into a decision with visible cost; she simply accepts the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows consistent interiority—his reflections on glassblowing and mother's warnings are embodied through concrete objects (bookmark, furnace). However, the final "choice" to flip switches feels symbolic rather than earned by prior contradiction; he moves from freeze to flow without a visible on-page trade-off or forfeited path. The internal conflict between isolation and connection is told more than dramatized in micro-choices. Backstory exceeds ~20% but anchors to present stimuli (bookmark, melting ice) and tilts his stance toward action, so BRR expansion applies without penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's phobia and stunt-double history are told rather than dramatized under pressure; the final "vulnerability isn't weakness" insight arrives as an assertion rather than emerging from on-page cost. The caretaker's recognition and his choked "I tried to protect you" gesture toward interiority but remain stock. The piece shows micro-choices (lunging forward, pressing the shell) but the emotional progression—from betrayal to "let's start over"—feels smoothed rather than contradictory or genuinely risky.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The oracle's motivation to "draw a map" arrives cleanly and her obsession with pebbles is embodied early. However, her interior arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves smoothly from mystery to understanding without genuine friction. The final choice—letting the gold leaf go—reads more as ceremonial release than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("ambered hush," "marbled blue") rather than character-specific perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    E-7X's central question ("Where do thoughts come from?") drives choices across the piece, and the final return to mopping carries visible renunciation—he doesn't have an answer but accepts pursuit. However, interiority leans abstract ("question burning in his core," "ghost of a melody") rather than embodied contradiction. The violin encounter permits micro-choices (plucking, pressing forehead) but the loop mechanism distances agency; we watch iterations rather than a single high-stakes decision under pressure. "Remarkably composed" remains label-only—no on-page moment where composure costs him or enables a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied ("pulse quickened," the weight of confession settling over her), and her final micro-choice—setting down the lens as a promise—flows from accumulated pressure. Elias's admission ("I needed to know who I could trust") lands with visible cost, and both characters show contradictory impulses: Mira has hoarded secrets while judging his quietness as indifference. Minor slip: the phrase "fear, his need to thaw the mistrust" edges toward label-only emotion in one beat, though the surrounding action (his shaky breath, the spread tickets) provides sufficient embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is specific—polishing marbles "as if by smoothing its flaws, he could mend something deeper"—and his choices (leaving marbles strategically, following the crack-map) show agency under the garden's pressure. The final act of carrying the seedling and scattering the marbles demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract label-speak ("mended deception" as a mantra rather than embodied struggle) and the forty-year backstory remains inert summary rather than a live constraint on present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never tested against competing desires or meaningful cost. Her interior reads as exposition-heavy rather than embodied contradiction; phrases like "obliging sky mechanic" and "delusions of grandeur" feel like labels rather than lived experience. The final choice to pull the lever lacks prior friction—no visible trade-off between scientific curiosity and station safety materializes on the page. The laugh at the end gestures toward emotional complexity but arrives without the groundwork of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to investigate the program is established early and drives her entry into the flooded space, but her interior life remains thin—motivations are more functional than contradictory. The bassoon case is mentioned once and never used, suggesting a musician identity asserted rather than enacted. The final choice to play the violin feels abrupt; no micro-choices or visible costs scaffold the shift from bassoonist to violinist. Elias functions as spectral conductor but exerts no interpersonal pressure; the relationship exists only as atmospheric witness.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interior life is concrete and particular—the "fault-tolerant oracle" framework shapes his perception of uncertainty as freeing rather than frustrating, and his embodied guilt over the false landslide prediction drives present action. The fever residue, the smudged illustration, and the descent to the clearing all register as choices under pressure. Minor slip: the final epiphany ("The oracle's burden wasn't to be right—it was to be present") edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is grounded enough in prior particulars to avoid a larger penalty. The cost of years spent fearing mistakes lands on the page through his physical descent and the photograph's note.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is established as reckless and skeptical, traits that drive his entrance and his choice not to flee. The final offering of the valve wheel shows agency, but his interior remains somewhat generic—"his mind raced," "he swallowed hard"—and the stated motivation ("the truth he'd been running from") is abstract, arriving late without concrete grounding in earlier choices. The figure's facelessness and the mannequin comparison feel more symbolic convenience than embodied threat that tests Elias's specific contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is consistently atmospheric but relies heavily on abstract meditation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to release the book to the river demonstrates agency, but the internal conflict leading to this choice remains muted—she watches "unmoved" rather than wrestling with competing desires. The embodied emotion is sparse; her interactions with objects (swan, book) are reverential but lack visceral texture. The final moment of wondering if she too is "a story waiting to be unfolded" gestures toward change but immediately deflects ("the thought passed"), weakening the cost of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is sketch-level: we learn he's a music therapist who believes in "ordinary magic" and finds a girl connected to the curl, but interior contradiction is absent and the choice to play for Liora feels predetermined rather than won through pressure. Liora appears fully formed with "cautious exuberance" but no embodied struggle. The final scene positions them at the eclipse with fingers laced, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges—the keepsake shifts from "question" to "beginning" via assertion, not dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied ("fingers...stained with ink or ash, traced the spines...as if they were pulse points"), and her perceptive attribute drives concrete micro-choices—pressing her palm to the silo, reaching toward the threads. Internal contradiction between her stated motivation (collecting stories) and her dawning suspicion ("wondered if she had been following them in the wrong direction") creates productive tension. The final choice to reach out feels earned by prior observation and the cumulative pattern of sensory noticing, though the moment when she crosses from observation to decisive action could carry more visible resistance or cost to charge the threshold fully.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand his father's cryptic legacy drives his investigation, but his interior remains thin—we get fact-retrieval more than embodied contradiction. The final choice ("Then let's play it") arrives without visible internal conflict or cost; he agrees too smoothly. The woman's arrival feels like a plot service rather than a crucible that forces Elias to weigh competing loyalties. Linus is vivid in backstory but remains a sketch; Elias never dramatizes what transposing his own life would cost him.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Father Elias possesses concrete interiority through embodied ritual (violet on lips, loop pedal at feet), and his motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" shapes the arc. However, his internal contradiction remains abstract—"what assumptions had he buried?" is stated rather than enacted through conflicted micro-choices. The possession threat never materializes as a felt cost that forecloses options; by the end, he "wasn't frightened," defusing the stake without visible sacrifice. Emotional progression reads as steady revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior is grounded in concrete images (shell, breath fog, mother's hands) and her chronological homesickness provides a consistent lens. The conductor memory and the fortune-cookie fragments show contradictory impulses—believing in shaping versus being shaped—but the final choice (closing eyes, remembering the school play) lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path. The "horizon cracking just a little" reads as poetic assertion rather than an earned shift in her stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given a clear want (escape whispers, conquer the labyrinth) but internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—he moves through visions and encounters without embodied tension between competing impulses. The scarred-self confrontation declares stakes ("You've come to kill me") but Elias's hesitation and final choice feel asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that test his hierarchy of values. Interiority leans abstract ("fractured—split between who he was and who he might have been") without the specific, embodied perception that would anchor his state under pressure. The ending grants wholeness as summary rather than visible cost that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's deafness is embodied through tactile sensing (pulse of earth, shiver of air), and his motivation to teach through rhythm rather than fix is well-drawn. Mira's numbness is shown through her trembling hands and the impulse to "cut through the fog," though her transformation at the end feels slightly over-articulated ("the numbness didn't disappear—it *changed*"). The final choice to "let it in" is earned by the cavern's accumulated pressure and the drum's tactile thrum, but edges toward therapeutic summary rather than staying purely in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's professional meticulousness is established through concrete detail (the brass clasp, twenty-three years), and his curiosity trait drives the central decision to investigate. However, the character remains somewhat static; his interior life consists largely of observation and abstraction ("the precision felt heavier," "integrity demanded more than observation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to move toward the eastern quarter is framed as inevitable rather than costing him a visible alternative, and the "nurturing integrity in solitude" motivation is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirien's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is clear and shapes her grotto exploration, but interiority skews abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The "ethically playful" trait appears as assertion without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Her final pull on the rope reads as inevitable but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the hesitation is described, not dramatized through concrete sensation or trade-off. The ending forecloses a path (pulling the rope) with cost felt in the light eruption, but the choice feels more thematic fulfillment than character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to "find beauty in the unfinished" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her actions follow a predictable arc—tune, play, listen, smile—without meaningful internal conflict or a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother's bowl and mother's lullaby are told backstory that prime the present but don't complicate it through micro-choices. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("she believed in the unfinished") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's "detachment as shield" and "caring too much" offers a credible internal contradiction, and the petal's charge provides embodied sensation. However, her profession remains largely label-work—"counterfeit emotion dealer" and "professionally thorough" are asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Darian's acceptance ("he never did") reads passive; his final question suggests habit rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The ending reflection "for whom, she wasn't sure" lands as abstract introspection rather than a turn driven by contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are coherent and his "whimsically attentive" observation of unseen workers anchors his character. However, the interior remains somewhat declarative ("Tonight wasn't about profit margins") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Mara's sudden proposal of the dockworkers' fund feels under-earned; her emotional turn from skepticism to partnership lacks intermediate friction. The final choice reads more as thematic alignment than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her arc—from watching "from the edges" to believing she belongs—lands on the page. Interior work is present but relies heavily on abstract yearning ("ache of being both present and untethered") rather than embodied contradiction. The travelers function as chorus rather than pressure; their acceptance feels granted rather than earned through dramatized friction. The final choice (placing the sculpture) forecloses isolation, but the cost reads more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority shows purpose and resolve, with embodied tension (trembling fingers, shallow breath). However, her internal contradictions are thin—she moves through the rooftop maze with determination but little visible cost until the final beat. The claim "she *knew*" undercuts dramatic uncertainty, and her choice to reach for the hourglass feels inevitable rather than conflicted. Motivation is clear but lacks the ambivalence or competing impulses that would elevate the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is atmospheric but thin on contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His motivation to understand "the mathematics of emotion" remains abstract; the choice to use the glass eyes is presented as inevitable rather than wrestled from competing desires. The final "smile, just slightly" and turn toward home gesture at resolution but lack embodied cost that forecloses a meaningful path. The sister's absence drives him, yet no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's seven-year existence in the library crawlspaces provides clear motivation, and the "kindly methodical" trait shapes his cataloging behavior. However, the final beat ("He could step forward now... Elias closed his eyes") offers observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he neither reveals himself nor commits to permanent hiding. The sense memory of his mother is embodied and acute, but interior contradiction remains muted; his warring impulses (reveal vs. hide) are stated rather than enacted simultaneously in the closure moment. The cache-building and Voss investigation show goal-pursuit, but the ending suspends agency rather than crystallizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's decision to "let go" rather than control emerges from her three-year practice and the physical evidence (bark yielding, branches twisting), but the shift feels more narrated than embodied—"understood then" arrives as statement rather than visceral realization. Her initial reluctance is signaled (crouching, hesitating), yet the final surrender lacks a painful trade-off or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("half gasp, half laugh") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's interiority is embodied through concrete detail (brooch warmth, chest tightening, hand-pooling rain) and his insomnia-driven obsession shapes present choices. Internal conflict emerges through the tension between painting to remember versus painting to forget, though the woman's final correction feels more authorial than earned through prior dramatization. The closure choice—taking her hand—follows logically from established motivation, but the cost of being "pulled under" remains more metaphorical than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's gift is rendered with concrete particulars (spoon, cat, laughter echo), and his interior stance is consistent. The pilgrim arrives forcefully but remains more archetype than individual—her "sharp teeth" and clinking vials gesture at menace without inhabiting a distinct psychology. The final realization "they were hungry" and "they were watching" reads label-only rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Elias's passivity at closure (lunging but grasping "empty air") undermines agency; the cost is declared rather than earned through an on-page choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to compile fragments is clear and her "reactively visionary" trait shapes her perception of the valves as a key. However, her interior life remains somewhat generic—"her fingers trembling" and the weight metaphor feel stock rather than character-particular. The partnership with Dain introduces status dynamics but their relationship lacks friction; he delivers exactly what's needed without complication. Interiority doesn't show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, which keeps the characterization in the competent but not exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's trait as a meticulous mapper is established through concrete action (tracing the map, studying the punch) and his "analytically artistic" nature drives his choice to descend. The final choice to take the conductor's hand feels earned by his established compulsion to find "places that shouldn't exist." However, interiority remains somewhat abstract—his internal conflict between caution and curiosity is told rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene. The embodied emotion is thin: we get fogging glasses and shallow breath, but the deeper cost of crossing this threshold lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's shift from skeptic to believer is signaled but feels more atmospheric than decisively earned by specific internal contradictions acting in scene. The embodied emotion is present ("breath hitched," "hands trembling") but leans toward stock gestures. His final choice to transcribe the memories flows logically from the tile's revelation, yet the renunciation or cost—what path he forecloses by believing—remains more implied than dramatized with visible consequence on the page. The grandmother backstory anchors motivation but occupies substantial reflective space without always tilting present micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Veyra's motivation ("discover what happens after goodbye") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choice to channel dimensional awareness into the fragment reads as reactive instinct rather than earned from prior internal conflict. Kael appears as a functional antagonist but remains a stock "reckless ally turned rival" without distinct voice or embodied particularity. The interiority relies on label-level emotion ("achingly profound," "tensed") and lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—he's weighing whether to hand over the ink pot or help the woman—and his internal contradiction (son of a con artist who wants to "bend the world back") lands on the page. The woman's backstory about her brother arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices. Elias's final decision ("Prove it") reads as a stance crystallization, but the woman's embodied reaction ("reached for it, then stopped") is undercut by her line "This isn't how it works," which tells rather than shows her internal conflict. The mother's reflection anchors present choices adequately, but the diplomat's death and the ink pot's properties are told, not dramatized through Elias's engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stationer's interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("earnestly studious," "patience," "longed to understand") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character observes and records but makes no micro-choices under pressure until the final writing moment, which arrives without prior conflict to earn it. The mysterious notepad entry and train whistle create atmosphere but don't force the protagonist to choose between competing goods with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "peace" at closure feels asserted rather than dramatized through physical state or perceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is textured through his relationship with the death certificate error and the poison label, but his moment-to-moment choices lack urgency—he collects and observes but rarely faces contradictory impulses that force visible tradeoffs. The woman who appears briefly offers thematic echo but doesn't apply pressure that alters his stance; she vanishes without cost. The final moment ("he didn't feel the need to run from it") gestures toward Earned Stasis but the renunciation feels declared rather than earned by prior causal friction. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, crouching in muck) yet his transformation lacks the tight causal throughline needed for the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's skepticism and investigative stance are established early, but his transformation feels abrupt—he moves from myth-buster to believer without genuine internal resistance or contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The fisherman's warning and the astronomer's vision provide exposition rather than embodied pressure. The final choice to embrace wonder lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; his skepticism dissolves without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lan's motivation is clear and her dual allegiance creates internal pressure, but key choices feel more told than embodied. The ending moment with Old Man Vey—"The raft survives because we choose it"—arrives as validation rather than a turn earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her organizational tactics (blocking surveyors, slow food service) read as competent problem-solving without visible struggle or costly tradeoffs that foreclose a path. The "culture shock absorber" trait remains largely label-only; we don't see her actively translating between worlds under pressure with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has clear interiority and a consistent perceptual filter (the geologist's grain, the way he notices micro-impacts). His agency is muted: he performs his assigned task without meaningful internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final acceptance ("some things were never meant to last") reads more as philosophical summary than embodied transformation driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's blindness and trust in touch are well-embodied through concrete actions (fingers on ceramic, testing water refraction). His motivation to decode feedback is consistent, but the arc lacks meaningful internal conflict—he never doubts his method or faces a competing impulse. The final moment ("Some things don't need eyes to be seen") edges toward platitude rather than earned insight through struggle. Mara remains functional but flat, present only to witness and affirm.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is concrete and professionally filtered—her atlas-editor precision shapes perception—but internal contradiction is thin. The shift to "subtly confident" at the end reads as a label rather than dramatized tension between doubt and certainty acting simultaneously. The keeper's hands trembling and Mira's breath-fogging establish embodied stakes, yet no meaningful renunciation or cost forecloses a path on the page; she simply decides to go. Motivation is signaled early but the closure choice feels more like continuation than transformation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tuner's infinitely patient stance is embodied through methodical pacing and ritualistic gestures (striking the fork, walking patterns), though his interiority remains largely opaque—we observe craft without contradiction or internal struggle. The character's emotional landscape is more gestural than visceral; phrases like "the tuner smiled" tell rather than embody affect. The final departure forecloses further engagement with visible cost (he leaves, the work is done), meeting the Earned Stasis threshold, but the choice feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page conflict. No secondary character pressure tests the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's motivation is coherent and embodied through concrete detail (the vial, rebreather checks, oxygen gauge). Interior contradiction appears when she kneels beside the diver—torn between salvage instinct and the temple's pull—but the final choice to uncork the vial feels slightly undercooked; we see her gaze flick to it without a dramatized moment of competing impulses. The diver's fragmentary speech and the temple's memory-touching create pressure, though the diver remains more atmospheric than a full secondary character. Emotional progression from isolation to offering is legible but could carry sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "thread the labyrinth" remains abstract; his choices (nudging a door, tracing names, speaking his name) lack embodied contradiction or visible cost that would earn the final renunciation. The father's legacy as "son of the boy who cried wolf" is label-heavy without dramatized stakes reshaping Elias's present tactics. Interiority leans on atmospheric descriptor ("hush coil around his throat") rather than micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The final act of speaking his name and running reads as externally triggered rather than earned through prior internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior life is embodied through action (kneeling, searching, fingers brushing soil) and the debt "gnaws...like a rat in the walls of her ribs" is concretely visceral. The memory-lacuna creates legitimate contradiction ("could not remember why"), but the final choice to accept remembering as repayment feels emotionally earned. Minor slip: the bride's relation to Liora shifts loosely ("sister, once, or her lover, or perhaps both") without clear dramatized friction that would make the ambiguity a live cost rather than ornamental blur.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear—carving a path from ruin to reverence—but her interior contradictions remain vague. The moment she picks up the needle and hears the voice is vivid, yet her choices feel guided by the labyrinth rather than internal conflict between contradictory impulses. The final weaving is described more as cooperative mysticism than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, shallow breath) but the peak choice reads passive.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is heavily abstract ("warmly curious hum settled in my chest," "quiet certainty") with minimal embodied contradiction under pressure. Motivation remains declarative rather than tested through micro-choices that foreclose paths; the digging montage ("Days bled into nights") summarizes struggle without dramatizing a single moment where conflicting impulses force a costly decision. The final kneeling reads as recognition rather than a choice that alters present options. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, and the woman from the fresco arrives to validate rather than complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear professional identity and his "carefully inventive" trait shows in the puzzle-solving, but his emotional arc feels telegraphed rather than discovered. The mother reveal lands as a surprise without sufficient internal contradiction or embodied cost beforehand—his emotional state moves too smoothly from puzzle-curiosity to reunion. The interiority leans on stock phrasing ("chest tighten," "pulse quickened") rather than character-specific perception. The final realization about "searching for his own [name]" reads as an unearned epiphany that arrives by assertion rather than through concrete struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to uncover the conspiracy is clear, and her disguise tactic shows agency under pressure. However, interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory; we see her notice patterns but not wrestle with conflicting impulses in the moment. The final choice to spread the message feels inevitable rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Embodied emotion is minimal—trembling hands are mentioned early but not developed under escalating stress.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior motivation is established early (seeking the moment before deciding, carrying guilt over an unsent letter), and the scar-fading moment provides embodied emotion. However, the apparition encounter lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she admits fear and the figure simply affirms it without internal friction or a visible choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. The final decision to pocket the shard and leave the letter unsent reads as acceptance rather than a choice earned by competing pressures, weakening the sense of alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—grounds her choices, and the coral fragment becomes a tangible anchor for her internal state. The boy mirrors her cast-notes, creating a shared wound language that feels purposeful. However, the anesthetic's role is mostly told ("the drugs softened the world's edges") rather than embodied in degraded perception or mistaken choices, and "shrewdly innocent" appears only as a retrospective label without constraining an on-page decision. The final smile feels earned by the coral-pulse synchrony, but the lack of a visible cost or foreclosed path keeps the change abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her artistic process is embodied through concrete action (setting up camera, developing film). Internal experience shows some layering when she feels "the weight in her chest lifting," but the epiphany arrives without sufficient on-page struggle or complication. The child-reaching-for-apple fresco lodges "like a splinter," yet this remains more poetic assertion than dramatized internal conflict that forces contradictory impulses into visible collision.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows methodically playful curiosity through his "what if" habit and concrete micro-choices (picking up the nickel, pressing it to glass), but his interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("breath fogging the glass," "ribs and squeezed"). The final moment—understanding the mural as door and being asked to step through—reads as realization rather than embodied struggle with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (came to restore certainty, finds ambiguity) but the progression feels more conceptual than viscerally enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Quill's motivation is present but stated more than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Elias shows micro-choices (reaching for the map) but his shift from resistance to compliance happens too quickly without visible internal friction. The inspector scene demonstrates some embodied tension, but the final commitment lacks the felt cost of foreclosing a path—Elias's retreat into his work is told rather than dramatized as a renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and embodied through trembling fingers and salt-tasting air, and his motivation to transmute grief into poetry drives the arc. The seventy-three sleepless nights and the sister's absence anchor concrete loss. However, the transformation from blocked writer to flowing poet happens too smoothly without dramatized internal resistance—the shell "leaning in" and words arriving "without thinking" bypass the struggle the setup promised. The final tears feel earned, but the breakthrough lacks the contradictory impulses that would show him wrestling with the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to preserve names is established through discovery and sustained across the piece, but her emotional stakes remain largely abstract—the "foxglove regret" is named, not embodied in contradictory impulses. The breakthrough with the bamboo tube arrives without visible internal friction or cost; she simply tries again and succeeds. The thirty-seven-year tenure and the vanished librarian seed backstory, but Liora's present choices don't reveal competing desires or a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's arc from scholar to active speaker shows clear progression, with embodied reactions (trembling fingers, hitched breath) and internal pressure driving her choice to complete the symphony. However, interiority relies heavily on external action and ritual rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to speak the last words feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict; we see determination but not the cost of renouncing safety until after the act.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to harmonize protection and honor is stated clearly but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The trembling hands are mentioned twice but function as labels rather than embodied degradation under stress. The climactic realization that "the floodgates weren't betrayal" feels delivered by the letter rather than earned through on-page struggle; her laugh arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal conflict remains conceptual summary rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are clear—preserve lost songs, reconcile with scholarly failure—and embodied through tactile interactions (tracing spines, holding the meteorite). The reinvention of identity carries weight, though the final choice to "stay" feels slightly abrupt given limited dramatization of internal resistance. Lena is functional but lightly sketched; her offer creates pressure without deep relational stakes. Minor deduction for the trembling-hands moment, which edges toward stock embodiment at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—finding Mira and understanding thresholds—reads clearly through embodied choices (tracing grain, picking up the prism). His final realization that "some thresholds were not meant to be crossed twice" feels earned by prior particulars. The reflection-heavy mode (approaching 40%) dilutes present pressure; multiple abstract blocks ("featherly determined," "necessary distances") remain static labels rather than contradictions acted in scene. Mira exists only in memory without on-page agency, so relationship pressure never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's quest for belonging is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The final hesitation ("For the first time, he belonged somewhere") arrives without prior dramatized cost that would make leaving credible. Liora remains a facilitator rather than a pressure source; their relationship never forces a trade-off. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("rhythm of belonging," "something akin to peace") rather than embodied particulars under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interior life is heavily told through abstraction ("emotions she transliterated," "quiet turns of fate") rather than embodied contradiction. The final decision to accept missing pieces arrives via summary epiphany without foregrounding a live on-page choice that visibly forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (picking up the seed) but feel gestural rather than pressured by competing impulses. The character remains observational and interpretive throughout, with no dramatized internal conflict forcing a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's analytical nature is established through her pattern-reading, but interiority remains somewhat generic ("tired of monotony"). Her choice to toss the bishop and begin the improvised performance shows agency, though the motivation feels more asserted than embodied under pressure. The violinist's arrival and acceptance reads convenient rather than earned through prior character work. Internal contradiction is minimal; she shifts from analytical observer to wild performer without visible cost or friction in the choice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation for elective exile is established early, and her decision to accept the tattooist's request shows agency under pressure. The moonstone speck anchors her emotionally, and her years of dancing in silence provide credible setup for the climactic choice. However, the man's character remains thinly sketched—his willingness to die for nostalgia arrives without internal conflict or earned stakes. The final mutual-exile commitment lands cleanly but would gain power if his risk felt more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is given interiority through his thirty-year history and embodied action (kneeling, dropping the stone), but his emotional arc remains largely abstract. The dream that wakes him and his "understanding" at the end lack causal specificity—what exactly changes in his hierarchy of values? The old woman's appearance feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality, and Elias's final realization ("not just the atrium's purpose, but his own") is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is embodied through scars and pack weight, and his interiority shows professional skill ("gently skilled at… reading the land") anchored in concrete action. The stranger's silver throat scar and stolen voice create visceral stakes. However, the final beat—"rewriting the bargain"—reads as metaphor rather than dramatized choice with visible cost, and the stranger's trembling fingers taking the pen feels like gesture without consequence. Internal contradiction is present (grief vs. professional detachment) but not tested under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is defined primarily through observational habits and internal labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The shell-arranging and gauge-touching are ritualistic rather than choices with visible cost. The dream sequence summarizes parallel versions rather than dramatizing on-page internal conflict. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned by prior causality—by the end she "understood" and smiled, a declared epiphany without forfeiting a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his sensitively perceptive nature appears consistently, but his interior life relies heavily on observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The father's obsession is vividly established through the diaries, yet Elias's own emotional progression reads more as wonder and inheritance than genuine internal conflict. The final choice to reach toward the map feels inevitable given the setup but lacks visible cost or a meaningful path foreclosed—he simply accepts the call. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "his hands shook," but therapy-adjacent phrasing like "Legacy's burden settled over him like a shroud" pulls toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to paint the mirage is established, but her interior life remains abstract—"borrowed heartbeat" and "grace" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The watchman exists primarily to verbalize theme rather than apply pressure through genuine conflict. The final shift from seeing to believing lacks a concrete choice with visible cost; it reads as epiphany rather than earned transformation through micro-decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora shows embodied tension (trembling clipboard, operatively gentle voice) and her exhaustion is credibly rendered. However, her internal contradiction never truly acts *in scene*—she questions redemption reflectively but never makes a micro-choice that tests competing impulses under pressure. Kessar's penitent arrival and coin gesture feel more symbolic than causally motivated by prior character work. The final decision to "carry it together" lacks visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's amorality is established through concrete details (smuggling, engineered drought), and the sentimental drawer provides contradictory depth. However, the final reversal—opening the dams—feels unmotivated by prior on-page pressure; his internal contradiction is told rather than tested through a difficult choice that forecloses options. The embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority remains cerebral summary rather than visceral experience under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's motivation to "defy the lullaby of conformity" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. The thread-untangling sequence shows problem-solving but lacks internal contradiction—each thread releases cleanly through memory recall rather than genuine struggle between competing desires. The final transformation ("her body no longer just a temple, but a testament") arrives as assertion without showing what path was foreclosed or what tangible price was paid. Interiority leans heavily on abstract poeticism ("the weight of her chastity a vow as heavy as the winter") rather than embodied, character-particular contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is told ("to explore ethical storytelling") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The argument with her brother is summarized backstory; we never see her make a micro-choice under pressure that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority leans abstract ("half-lit epiphanies," "quiet revelations") without embodied sensation. The final smile declares serenity but no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is poetic but often abstracts emotional states ("blushing stillness of the moment") rather than embodying them through concrete sensation. Her esoteric realist stance is declared more than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure. The story anchors her motivation to honor monarchs, yet she remains observational; her building of signals feels ritualistic rather than driven by internal conflict with visible trade-offs. No clear renunciation or cost forecloses a path—she simply packs and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation is clear and his internal journey from guilt to action is legible, but the transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he moves smoothly from self-forgiveness to preservation work without friction. The embodied emotion is strongest in "the weight in his chest ease" and the rope "technically gentle in his hands," but much of the interiority leans on abstraction ("silence he had once accepted"). The foundry collapse backstory anchors his guilt, yet the lack of on-page resistance or cost during the rope-weaving sequence flattens what could be a more fraught renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand why paths choose walkers is declared but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His interior relies on elevated abstraction ("edges of things—the places where order frayed into chaos") rather than concrete stakes or trade-offs. The dream woman delivers insight without Elias earning it through on-page struggle. His final acceptance ("the directive had never been about preservation, but about choice") reads as epiphany rather than decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nabu-sharru's frugality and devotion to knowledge are established early and shape his theft of the tile, but his internal contradictions remain mostly told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The dialogue with the twilight figure shows some values hierarchy, but the astronomer's shift from seeking understanding to accepting preservation feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "trembling finger" and bowed head are the primary physical markers in a story that otherwise operates at high philosophical register. The final choice—accepting the covenant—lands without a legible cost that forecloses another path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction (scheming pacifist) is present but never dramatized as competing impulses in scene. The pivot from revenge to pity arrives too easily—"faced with the man who had shaped her pain, she found only pity"—without embodied struggle or micro-choices showing the shift. Veyra's amnesia strips away the moral friction the setup promised, flattening the confrontation. The final choice to "release" resentment reads as declared rather than earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mirror maker's interiority is filtered through poetic compression but remains consistent—his practical grounding contrasts with the pull toward mystery. Embodied action (breathing sync, climbing, holding the dream) anchors emotional progression. The final realization about trust over possession earns the shift, but the dream's loneliness is asserted rather than dramatized through prior contradiction. Minimal internal conflict weakens the agency test; he moves toward the dream without meaningful hesitation or cost to his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interiority shows genuine contradiction—she wears the ribbon as both reminder and wound, and her response to the girl's question about promises reveals embodied hesitation. The micro-choice to give repair advice that doubles as self-reflection ("some promises don't break, even when they're supposed to") demonstrates hierarchy of values under pressure. The girl's personality is vivid through gesture and sharp dialogue, though her arc is more device than struggle. Minor: the mender occupation remains label-level; we see the repair but not the professional knowledge under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The curator's interiority shows specific embodiment ("fingers trembling," water "seeping into her bones") and her final choice to pursue rather than own the shell is earned by the progression of her inquiry. However, the epiphany in the bath arrives through abstract philosophizing rather than concrete scene pressure, and the "brightened disquiet" emotional label appears repeatedly without varied embodiment. The predecessor's cryptic note and the curator's obsession provide motivation, but the internal contradiction between scholarly caution and forbidden pursuit remains under-dramatized until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trait of being "carefully resourceful" is stated but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations (finding her sister) are declared late and feel added rather than driving prior beats. The time traveler remains generic—his panic is told, his choices convenience-driven. Internal contradiction is absent; both characters move through the labyrinth without visible struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His motivation to "understand" remains abstract until the final beat; the garden encounter offers no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he steps forward, exchanges dialogue, then dissolves into fog without dramatized renunciation or agency. Liora functions as a static symbolic presence rather than a pressure source; her "blissfully aberrant light" is label-only and never constrains a choice. The chimera-twin concept is told rather than enacted through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to uncover truth is clear and she shows methodical persistence when working the rope. However, interiority remains largely declarative ("She had always dismissed them as myths") rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The final archival decision feels like a thematic statement rather than a choice with visible personal cost—we don't see what she forecloses by making the truth public.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ryn's interiority is concrete and her motivation to find silence amid chaos is embodied through the stone's warmth and her ear pressed to ice. The final decision to bind the bloom and flee is earned by prior setup, though the choice itself feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn. Internal contradiction is light—she never seriously weighs staying or abandoning the mission—so the stakes feel more external (beings' pursuit) than internal (competing desires). Embodied emotion is present but limited to physical cues; deeper ambivalence or cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies—custodian duty evolves into active rekindling mission. Interior life is rendered through evocative particulars: "taste of old rain," "weight of cities that no longer stood." However, the protagonist remains largely solitary with minimal contradiction or flawed choice under pressure; his motivation ("prove that coincidences have meaning") is asserted more than tested on the page. The final walk feels predetermined rather than earned through conflicted agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is specific and grounded in archival work, but her motivations blur between philosophical abstraction and concrete stakes. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait remains mostly decorative—it flavors perception but doesn't constrain a visible choice with cost. Her final turn toward the fog bridge reads as an announcement of intent rather than a dramatized decision that forecloses options. Embodied contradiction is present in her fear versus pursuit, but the closure moment lacks the micro-choice friction that would earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interior voice is vivid and embodied ("the weight of the dark pressing down like a held breath"), with contradictory impulses present—she isn't a hero yet responds to a calling. However, her arc from wandering designer to kneeling witness feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The final shift to "remember hopelessness" arrives as a realization told in narration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("to defy the gravity of hopelessness") without embodied struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and specific—"trying to discover the texture of time" shows a particular perceptual signature. Her decision to return to the surface reads as motivated, though the interior contradiction between avoidance and engagement could be sharper. The brother's off-stage presence functions as pressure but his status as secondary character is never dramatized on the page. The final choice to climb back feels earned but the visible cost remains oblique—what path is foreclosed is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's claustrophobia and desire for space drive her onto the trellis, and her relationship with the doll provides embodied interiority. The boy's appearance dilutes focus without deepening conflict, and his recognition-grin feels unearned. Liora's final nod toward "next time" suggests endurance but the cost remains abstract—what path has she foreclosed by climbing, and what has she learned that changes her stance toward the bunker? The embodied fear ("walls pressed in like ribs") works, but the ending choice lacks visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete—monitoring noise, recognizing the woman's searching look—and his micro-choices (stopping the gondola, sharing insights) advance pressure. The woman's arc from tension to release reads clearly through embodied markers (ink-stained fingers, closed eyes, relaxed shoulders). However, her internal conflict remains largely told rather than dramatized in contradictory action; we learn she's "trying to catalyze" silence but don't see her wrestle with competing impulses in scene. The storm glass functions as an external correlative but doesn't substitute for on-page character contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Veyra's motivation is clear—she seeks the throne as steward rather than from greed—but her interiority reads generic. The "wisely adventurous" trait is label-only; the story tells us she embodies it rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to sit feels unmotivated by prior causality; she descends, sees murals, and simply sits without a visible decision under pressure or a cost that forecloses another path. The emotional progression from decades of scholarship to claiming a throne lacks embodied conflict or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shadow keeper's contradictory impulses—isolation versus the pull of her scar—create genuine tension, and the moment she touches the child's scar earns the final shift. However, her interior voice leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("the cost of mercy," "bridges, thin and fragile") that dilutes embodied specificity under pressure. The child remains functional but flat, serving primarily as a mirror rather than exerting independent pressure. Motivation is present and the arc closes, but the peak beat relies on symbolic gesture more than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior voice carries specificity—"virtuously mischievous," the pressure metaphor—but key choices feel underdetermined. The decision to turn the bolt counterclockwise and reject the swap arrives without embodied tension between competing desires; we see the choice but not the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final pivot to teaching feels tacked on, a thematic hedge rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and grounded (uncovering his family's erasure), and his choice to use the crank handle is dramatized with embodied hesitation ("his fingers closing around it with a certainty that defied logic"). However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("sharp and sudden, sliced through his fatigue") and the great-uncle specter delivers exposition rather than forcing Elias into a live dilemma. The ending stops at revelation without a visible cost that forecloses a path; Elias learns the truth but does not yet act or renounce.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's interior life shows some contradiction—years of withdrawal versus an unnamed pull—but his passivity dominates. The final choice to "not resist" reads more like surrender than agency, and the motivation for letting the strings take him lacks concrete embodiment of what he's trading away. The woman is a cipher who applies pressure but remains a stock facilitator. Embodied emotion is present in hitched breath and trembling sword, but the peak moment lacks a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" is clear and his final choice to add a note to the file shows agency, but interiority remains largely declarative ("his heart ached," "chest tighten") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arc from grief-paralysis to active memorialization is legible but earned more through summary of his research than through on-page micro-choices that reveal cost. Daniel exists only as archival trace, which fits the premise but limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's resourcefulness is embodied through concrete actions (hoarding the key, following puddle reflections, uploading the drive), and her final smile carries contradictory weight—triumph and acceptance of erasure. However, interiority leans toward stock revolutionary phrasing ("the tyranny of indifference," "hold the line") that flattens character-particular texture. The enforcers' wavering rifles and her step forward suggest agency, but the cost of her choice—capture, erasure, or death—remains abstract rather than viscerally grounded in bodily or relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is adequately established through his relationship to the prophecy and music, but his decision-making remains largely uncontested—he arrives knowing "the time had come" and executes without meaningful internal friction. The embodied detail (dewdrops on reeds, lungs burning) anchors physicality, yet the peak choice to "play it back" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final lighter case suggests cost, but the mechanism by which music "took something from him" stays abstract, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is stated (decode falling leaves, sort chaos into order) but her interiority reads label-only: "her edges softened, her movements slower" is summary rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation sequence—moss on hands, vines in hair—lands as ornamental rather than felt cost tied to prior choices. Her final smile and continued leaf-sorting lack visible foreclosure; she appears unchanged in stance despite the arbor's contact, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's interiority is specific to his tinkerer's trade ("brass gears frozen mid-tick," "if coincidence had brought him this far"), and the compass's wildly spinning needle embodies his uncertainty in concrete terms. The phrase "uncertainly certain" is deployed as meta-commentary rather than enacted through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice—activating the clock—arrives without visible cost or felt trade-off; the city's figures pause, but no forfeited path or personal price is dramatized on the page. Motivation for befriending uncertainty is told early but not tested by a high-stakes pivot that forces him to choose between precision and chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is consistent and her final choice lands with embodied cost ("her fingers lingering against his"), but her interior relies heavily on interpretive abstraction ("grief was a blunt instrument," "philosophy of scars") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Elias's sudden pivot to clarity after feverish work lacks the textured degradation expected under sustained stress. The renunciation-as-forgiveness closure is credible, but the protagonist's emotional arc resolves too cleanly without visible friction between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The collector's motivation (seeking laughter as rebellion against death) is established early and drives the encounter, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The woman's arc from "forgot how to leave" to remembering feels earned by the interaction, though her transformation occurs quickly. The crocodile's tooth receives repeated mention but functions more as atmospheric detail than a choice-shaping object; its "thin line between mercy and cruelty" remains asserted rather than tested on the page. Modest fearlessness is shown through his approach but not truly pressured by a competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation ("mathematics of mercy") is signaled early and informs his stance, but interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("proprioceptively enhanced body," "exact formula") rather than embodied contradictions. The flashback to interrogations anchors trauma responses, yet the stranger's arrival and vial offer resolve tension through external gift rather than internal wrestling. The final realization—"knowing when to stop"—feels stated rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and drives her search, but her interior life remains thin—she observes and collects without facing contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final choice to keep searching feels declared rather than earned through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Backstory about her father is brief and anchored to the fragment's vibration, but the present-tense decisions lack friction; she acquires, writes, and returns without visible loss or renunciation that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's observational trait is embodied through concrete details (dust spirals, cobweb tremors, handprint in grime), and her agency drives the final action. The moment she presses the mainspring barrel against the fracture shows contradictory impulses—professional duty versus metaphysical intervention—acted out in scene. Interiority is largely concrete ("the weight of something lift"), though "ghosts didn't care about union hours" edges toward wry summary. No motivational break at closure, and the cost (years of watching, ongoing vigilance) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is presented with conceptual labels ("cryptic letterpress operator," "compressing eternity") but few concrete micro-choices that embody those abstractions under pressure. His decision to uncork the whisper lacks hesitation or internal conflict; the act reads more as plot trigger than character-driven choice. The final acceptance ("perfection was a prison") arrives as assertion rather than earned contradiction between competing impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse—breath curling "like smoke" and palm on frost are gestures, not layered contradictory states.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is established early with concrete interiority (the shard as talismanic object, his ritual with mirrors). His motivation to "reimagine that entire civilization" reads clear but stays abstract; the final act (speaking verse to activate mirrors) feels unmotivated by prior on-page choices—no earlier beat shows him testing this method or paying a smaller cost. Liora functions as functional opposition but remains a voice rather than a pressure that forces Elias into a hard trade-off. The ending gesture (slumped, breathless, eyes alight with hope) lands as label-only emotion rather than embodied consequence with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's interior life shows some texture—childhood memory, the accusation "You left me"—but his motivation pivots abruptly from denial ("just things") to enlightenment without micro-choices that dramatize the shift. The stranger functions as oracle rather than pressure, delivering exposition that Elias accepts wholesale. The "wilting near dishonesty" trait is asserted in narration but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Embodiment is present (trembling hands, ragged gasps) but emotional progression feels scaffolded rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through concrete action (collecting petrichor, descending into caves) and his relationship to the grandfather's fear is embodied through psychometry. However, the final encounter with the grandfather-figure lacks earned motivation—the decision to uncork the vial feels more symbolic than driven by prior internal conflict. The transformation from collector to participant needed one more micro-choice that dramatizes cost rather than ritual completion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as a sculptor remains consistent, and his choice to carve the bridge at the end is grounded in his craft. However, his interior life is thin—he moves from skepticism to acceptance of magic with minimal on-page friction or embodied doubt. The final choice to stay feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or visible cost ("He didn't know how long he'd stay" undercuts agency). Mara and the ensemble characters are functional but lack individuated voice or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's obsession is clearly stated but her interior choices rarely reflect genuine contradiction or cost. The grandmother's memory offers mild color, but the "understanding" at the cathedral arrives as a passive epiphany ("She understood then, not with her mind but with something deeper") without embodied friction or a foreclosed path. The final flower addition feels like symbolic completion rather than a choice that alters her stance with visible price. Interiority leans abstract ("tugged at her like the pull of the moon") without character-specific embodiment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (archiving silenced voices), but her interior life defaults to generic archivist tropes without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The retrocognition "gift" arrives as convenient plot machinery rather than emerging from established character traits. Her decision to ignore Rourke's warning and venture to the lagoon feels plot-mandated rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final sprint lacks embodied cost—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path that would signal meaningful change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" through mental alchemy is established but remains abstract; his interior contradiction—stubborn rejection of false comfort versus needing *something* new—is told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The pivotal "working memory" experiments lack sensory embodiment: we're told he "lets the image sear," but the physical and emotional cost of this sustained effort is summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses. The ending choice—letting the image go and stepping outside—reads passive; the town's revival happens *to* him rather than through a renunciation or sacrifice with visible cost, making the final stance feel unmotivated by prior on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is present throughout and his profession is clear, but his interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The pomegranate omen and phonograph work feel like symbolic gestures he performs without visible internal resistance or cost. His "realization" that the foghorn's silence is an invitation arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized pressure. The final smile and red-stained fingers read as thematic closure without a demonstrated character choice that forecloses a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to preserve and revive is established through her seed-saver past and the egg guardianship, with the acorn cap serving as an embodied anchor. Her final choice to "carry the weight forward" feels earned by the vision of the greenhouse past. However, the protagonist remains mostly contemplative; the hatchling does the active work while Liora observes and interprets. The interiority leans abstract ("furiously tranquil energy," "texture of borrowed time") without enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("the girl who waits for nothing," her seven years listening to sky whispers), and her hierarchy of values—favoring listening over noise—creates the central tension. The moment she lets the rope slip, then grabs it when the storm changes, shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with visible cost. Minor weaknesses: the priests and villagers remain abstractions, and some emotion is told rather than embodied ("her shoulders relaxing"). The final kneeling posture and bone-deep vibration ground the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is well-established through his relationship with the station and the lantern glass, and his motivation to find strength in vulnerability is shown through his decades of custodial care. The star-witnessing moment shifts his self-perception from janitor to witness, marking a meaningful internal change. However, the transition relies heavily on reflective telling rather than difficult choices under pressure, and the final shift feels more epiphanic than earned through contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The motivation is coherent but the arc follows a contemplative reveal pattern rather than crisis-driven agency.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is anchored by seventeen years of silence and his perceptive witnessing of ghosts, but the interior remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The opening of the box is motivated by the ghost's insistence but the decision feels more compliant than torn. The woman ghost's recognition triggers weight in his ribs, a decent embodied moment, but the final act (scattering flower dust) reads passive. Backstory (seventeen-year silence, the traveler's gift) is economical and primes the present choice, staying within BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias possesses consistent interiority and his desire to understand time's texture drives choices, but his micro-decisions often summarize rather than dramatize contradiction under pressure. The dream sequence introduces the woman-keeper without prior anchoring, creating a convenience leap. Embodied emotion appears sporadically—"his pulse quickened" and "breath hitched" do work—but pivotal beats like accepting his role as time's keeper lack visible internal cost or foreclosed paths. The final choice to write tags reads as acceptance without struggle, undercutting earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is concrete and embodied ("the silence was a living thing, coiled around her ribs"), and her grief over her brother drives the journey to the lagoon. The feather choice and her decision to wade in show micro-choices under pressure. However, the epiphany about "harmonizing discord" arrives more as contemplative realization than as a hard-won choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she arrives at insight without meaningful renunciation or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (preserving interspecies wisdom) is established early and his systematic wire-wrapping actions are embodied and purposeful. Internal conflict is present but understated—he knows he will die and the orchard will likely be destroyed, yet continues methodically. The final choice to reshape the orchard is consistent with his character, though the cost (his time, his body's limits) could be more viscerally felt on the page. The animals' trust provides texture but doesn't apply pressure or force a harder decision.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's shift from skeptic to believer is traced through clear micro-choices (adjusting satchel, hesitating at entrance, pulling out amber), and his internal contradiction—dismissing pilgrimage as "fool's errand" while undertaking it—feels embodied. However, the final turn dissolves his skepticism too cleanly without visible cost; "replaced by something brighter, something like belief" reads as summary rather than dramatized struggle. Liora remains functional but flat, applying pressure without her own stakes or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life is established through sensory filtering ("spoke dead languages...not the kind found in books") and his physical presence is embodied (boots sinking, fingers brushing pods). However, his motivation to "fertilize the idea of return" remains abstract rather than rooted in contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; he moves through the ritual without visible internal cost or friction. The final choice to scatter seeds and leave reads as contemplative observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt weight. Embodied emotion is present but lacks the layered contradictions that would elevate past competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by clear past trauma and his hands shake—embodied emotion—but the final choice to "walk into the dark" lacks on-page cost or visible consequence that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is present (running from vs. being called back by the dead), yet the ending decision feels more like setup than earned agency. The backstory dominates without sufficient present micro-choices to tilt his stance with visible trade-off. Reflection exceeds ~30% without interleaved present alterations that change options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's gift of seeing time-threads is established but remains abstract; his motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to sketch is presented as epiphany ("Elias understood then") without prior dramatized resistance or cost that would make the decision feel earned. Internal life leans on summary ("his curse was less a burden") and label-only emotion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirien's motivation is clear and her choices drive the plot, but interiority remains somewhat generic ("her pulse quickening," "her stomach dropped"). The guardian encounter shows tactical thinking through the chess-piece gambit, and the final realization demonstrates growth. However, the transformation feels more told than embodied—"she realized" rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to unbind herself from scripted roles is established, but her interior contradictions remain largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The crisis-actor backstory provides intriguing texture yet feels more thematic than causal—her performance history doesn't create on-page friction that complicates her choices. The historian's entrance and their final walk together shows some interpersonal pressure, but the relationship remains more allegorical than dynamically tested. Micro-choices are present but muted; the decision to leave the chessboard lacks visible cost that forecloses a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to understand the shape of home") is poetic but remains abstract; his interior state is heavily told through mercury-glass metaphors rather than embodied contradiction. The visions and mercury pooling read as ornamental attributes without forcing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The feather-stone sequence offers action, but the final "understanding" arrives as assertion ("home wasn't a place to return to, but a shape to carve") rather than earned through on-page renunciation with visible cost. Interiority leans into label-speak ("the ache of a talent buried too deep") at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's fidgeting is rendered concretely (ring-twisting, coat-plucking) and his internal guilt over Liora's death is embodied through the tapestry investigation. The final shift to stillness is motivated by the mirror-memory confrontation and Liora's voice granting permission to forgive. However, the pivotal choice—deciding to forgive himself—feels somewhat asserted rather than a micro-decision sequence with visible tradeoffs; the moment he "exhaled" closes the arc but the internal contradiction prior to that beat is underplayed. Backstory is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (tapestry threads) and primes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's defiance is established early and drives her choice to engage with Echo and pursue the poetry ritual, but her motivations remain largely abstract—"warnings were just another color on her palette" gestures toward personality without embodying a contradictory impulse acting in scene. The shift from needing to "break something first" to speaking poetry feels unmotivated; no on-page friction forces the change. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("alive" as the payoff emotion) and the final renunciation ("The ritual could wait") lacks visible cost or foreclosed path scaled to the established pressure. Echo's "innocently mischievous" trait is label-only and does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistent and his embodied fear of dissolution reads concretely ("lungs burning"). The pattern-matching choice at the end grows from his established compulsion to stitch meaning, but the final decision arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost—he simply proceeds. The mentor's vanishing and Elias's near-suicide are told rather than dramatized, weakening the weight of his scars. "Kintsugi intentions" and the quilting metaphor are labeled more than enacted in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's return to the caves is motivated by a buried promise, and his descent shows embodied choices under pressure (lunging for the shell, pulling onto the ledge). However, the final beat—sitting before a blank canvas with wet paint—lacks clear agency; the paint is "still wet, as if someone had been here just moments before," which suggests external arrangement rather than earned decision. The closing act of painting "the space between" reads as abstract epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a clear thesis (whispers travel farther than shouts) and his interiority is consistent, but his choices feel more demonstrative than conflicted—he never doubts his premise under pressure. The cork-and-vial experiment reads as a symbolic proof rather than a risky internal wager with visible cost. Maren's shift from scoffing to "something like understanding" is told rather than earned through a micro-choice that alters her stance on the page. Embodied emotion is present ("breath caught") but the peak moment relies on atmospheric confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to find his sister and navigate loss is clear, but his interior life remains somewhat abstracted—"geography of loss" functions more as repeated metaphor than lived contradiction. The midnight phone calls provide external pressure, but his moment-to-moment micro-choices (setting down the censer, packing his notebook) lack urgency or visible internal conflict. The final smile and decision to continue feel inevitable rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and there's no renunciation or foreclosed path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's contradictory impulses—cultivating safety versus confronting truth—act simultaneously on the page. Her involuntary truthfulness drives concrete choices (pressing the eye to her socket, burying it) with visible costs. The dream sequence and final stance crystallization feel earned by prior causality, though the orchard fox moment reads slightly ornamental. Embodied emotion is strong ("her stomach tightening," "hands shaking"), and the trajectory from isolation to accepting "the storm" forecloses her safety-in-silence path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied in the opening ("his breath fogging the salt-crusted glass"), and his micro-choices—deciding to investigate via gaps, sitting beside the empty space—are character-particular. However, the borrowed-memories passage veers into convenient epiphany: "A mountain pass, a woman in a red shawl, the bitter taste of absinthe" arrive as atmospheric download rather than embodied perception earned through Elias's lived experience. The final promise to tend the story feels asserted rather than tested under pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path shapes that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and well-anchored in sensory detail (tracing coastlines, the warm chip). The decisive act—pressing the chip into the door—arrives with minimal prior conflict between contradictory impulses; the "promise" feels hollow but no competing desire dramatizes resistance on the page. The choice to step through reads more as revelation than renunciation, so the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Embodied emotion is present but the stakes crystallize late.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The queen's interior is present but abstract: "spent a lifetime issuing decrees," "the climb had not been the end," without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation clarity suffers—starlight etching happens off-page; her decision to climb feels declarative rather than dramatized via conflicting impulses. The mirror encounter offers a choice (touching the surface) but lacks visible cost on the page; the transformation ("no longer marked by constellations") reads as convenient reset. Embodied emotion is thin; "pulse quickened" and wind tugging robes are generic bodily cues.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is presented clearly, and her choice to uncork the vial and combine it with the nautilus curl shows agency. However, her interior life leans heavily on abstract concepts ("palette of resolve," "density of presence") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final gesture of taking Elias's hand feels more like a thematic conclusion than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Elias remains somewhat thin—his transformation is asserted ("polished by time") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is richly textured—jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia, the compulsion to collect scrolls—but his moment-to-moment choices rarely pivot under pressure. The ending door-rattle creates suspense without forcing a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied contradiction is present (resentment vs. hunger for clarity), yet the closure lacks agency: something arrives at him rather than his action reshaping options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is specific and embodied—his sensory loss creates genuine constraint, and his "reading between lines" through touch and vocal tremor feels lived-in. Clara's stillness and the revelation that Elias was the boy his grandmother delivered create strong contradictory pressure: gratitude layered with grief. The final choice to etch the screw is motivated by prior causality, but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—what does Elias forfeit or endure in this act? Minor deduction: "humanize it" as a request reads slightly abstract for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior life shows some texture—grief solidified into silence, scars as metaphor—but the arc from failure to breakthrough lacks sufficient internal contradiction acting in scene. The crow quill memory and mother's death are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that test her present stance. The final smile feels unearned; we don't see her wrestle with conflicting impulses on the page, only move through a sequence of reflections toward resolution. Embodied emotion is present but the journey reads more like thematic illustration than lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's guilt and need for closure are well-embodied through physical detail (wire-rimmed glasses fogging, shaky breath). Internal contradiction surfaces when he rolls up his sleeves despite twenty years of avoidance, and the final moment—hearing his own younger voice saying "I'm sorry"—earns the shift. The reflective material about Clara is substantial but anchored in present stimuli (the perfume bottle, the curator's words) and tilts his stance toward action. Minor deduction: the backstory occasionally summarizes emotional stakes rather than letting them emerge fully through present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (preserving definitions, resisting dissolution) is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract throughout—we get philosophical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to press the dictionary to the stone and walk into the void reads as predetermined rather than earned through visible internal conflict. No secondary character applies immediate pressure. The "wanderingly exact" trait appears as a label without constraining a choice or revealing a hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias functions as a single-POV observer with embodied attention (adjusting eyepiece, squinting, pressing thumb to razor edge), but he remains largely reactive until the final beat. The blood-sacrifice choice arrives late without prior micro-choices that establish a pattern of risky physicality or mystical thinking. Interior texture relies heavily on contemplative observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The backstory fragments from Harkin's logs anchor present stance but do not create a trade-off between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode her father's cryptic system is established, but her interior voice leans on stock phrasing ("the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs"). The father's compulsive gambling and probability teaching create useful contradictions, yet his final theory feels asserted rather than earned through her on-page choices. Micro-choices exist (lighting the matchbook, deciding to "burn the numbers herself") but the final stance—paying debts by rejecting his games—arrives as epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior world is established through concrete detail (booth, disc, tunnel routine), and her "cultivated estrangement" is embodied in the listening pattern. The woman's "I think I'm ready" and the boy's disappearance provide micro-choices with cost. However, the reflection on grief and foster-home stories risks summary; the final question "if she had done enough" feels abstract rather than tied to a specific on-page price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—"feeling the past press against his ribs," tracing the locket edges—and his archival profession colors perception. The decision to release the locket feels earned by the accumulation of pressure, though the micro-choices leading to that moment could be more visibly conflicted on the page. "The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go" edges toward therapeutic self-awareness that flattens the final beat slightly. Internal contradiction is present (holding versus releasing) but acts more in alternation than simultaneously in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's desperately jocular manner is labeled early but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure; the card-game backstory and astronaut anecdote feel like inserted color rather than earned particulars that constrain his present tactics. The logistician remains a cipher—voice and motive are withheld, reducing relationship pressure to a one-sided transaction. The final realization that "loneliness isn't a disease" arrives as an assertion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, and Elias's shift from empty to feeling "like a man who had just been handed the beginning of something" reads as a mood change rather than an earned stance alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("her grief, her longing, her quiet rage") rather than embodied contradiction. The core motivation—to understand herself—drives her forward, but the climactic moment at the stillpoint dissolves tension through poetic summary ("felt her edges blur, her fears unravel") rather than a concrete choice with visible cost. The laugh and inward-pointing compass offer a micro-turn, but no prior contradictory impulse is shown acting simultaneously in scene. Backstory (father's compass, generations of cartographers) anchors present stance without overwhelming, fitting BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's "confidently uncertain" trait is primarily asserted through narrator description rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The contingent relationships with Elias and others are told rather than shown constraining her choices under pressure. The final choice to "decide what to keep" arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page; we see intention but not consequence. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("fragile thing," "performance she maintained") and therapy-speak ("contingent relationships") rather than character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority shows embodied contradiction—grief aching while her heart soars—but the "quietly charismatic" trait remains label-only without constraining choices. Elias functions primarily as observational echo rather than pressure source; his "whispering advisor" role doesn't force meaningful decisions. The mother's death backstory anchors present emotion effectively, but the final shift from "forgotten" to "seen" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized cost. Micro-choices (lifting camera, signing) texture the scene but don't foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("three years off the grid") but her internal conflict never materializes on the page—she shifts from tracker to liberator without visible contradiction or cost. The Ember Scribe's fever-bright intensity is vivid, but his sudden trust ("You were always part of the message") feels unearned; no prior choice dramatizes why he accepts her help. Interiority relies on labels ("analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to help lacks friction; no competing impulse complicates her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (finding Liora) is clear and drives his choices, and the serum's physical effects are embodied ("burning through his veins like liquid starlight"). However, the final merger—"He wasn't just Elias anymore. He was her"—arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; the interiority reads more like poetic assertion than dramatized struggle. The sister exists primarily in reflective fragments rather than as a pressure that tests present decisions. Backstory occupies substantial real estate but tilts present stance only weakly; the lab escape and garden journey feel more like fulfilling a predetermined path than navigating genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life shows embodied detail (static in gloves, teeth aching, nervous coin-flipping) and his occupation grounds his perceptual filter. However, his decision to hand over the key feels unmotivated—no internal contradiction or weighing of cost precedes the choice. The woman arrives with no prior setup and becomes a co-protagonist without dramatized relationship pressure. The final grin suggests satisfaction but no foreclosed path or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maris's interiority is anchored in embodied silence and purposeful action—she traces wood as braille, angles the mirror, places the stone—with a consistent perceptual signature. The child's entrance introduces relationship pressure that tests Maris's teaching stance, and the stone gift plus the mirror gesture carry micro-choices that alter the encounter's trajectory. The closure line "she would keep weaving, one silent pattern at a time" affirms endurance but lacks a visible cost on the page that forecloses a path; the renunciation or price remains implied rather than dramatized. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and the girl's responses feel age-appropriate, but the final beat's lack of felt consequence caps the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "plant forests of second thoughts" is told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. His interior is weighted with abstraction ("the whispers were different," "grief wasn't a game you could win") that labels rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The final walk into mist with magnets feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. His sister's loss anchors backstory but does not create on-page friction between wants and fears at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirien's interiority is concrete and her progression from self-effacement to self-acceptance is clear, but the transformation arrives too easily. The mother-figure's pronouncement "You've always been free, daughter. You only had to stop fighting what you are" slides into therapeutic language that no one speaks mid-crisis. The final choice—walking back to the docks with new confidence—lacks visible cost; nothing is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is embodied through whittling and tea ritual with clear internal contradiction—cultivating lightness while drowning in grief. The mask metaphor risks label-speak but is rooted in habitual performativity. The wife's dream voice reopens the wound with specificity ("sheets are smoothed, the corners tucked just so"), and his crying upon waking shows embodied cost. Motivation remains consistent but the final stance feels likeループ rather than earned alteration or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interior life is rendered through sensory particulars ("tremor of certainty in her chest," "current of knowing"), and embodied perception anchors her motivation. However, she remains essentially static—no contradictory impulses emerge, and her agency consists mostly of observation and internal assertion rather than choice under pressure. The final act ("she stepped forward") reads as declarative confirmation rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses an alternative path. The lack of on-page conflict or trade-off caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's colorblindness shapes his perception and creates internal conflict ("not about the colors...about the weight of them"), but his choices feel more reactive than agentive—he agrees to Liora's bargain without visible deliberation or cost in that moment. The final painting choice is signaled more as relief than a hard-won shift that forecloses a prior path. Mara and Liora remain functional but slightly interchangeable in their symbolic roles (wisdom-giver, mysterious bargainer) rather than individuals under their own pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation (discovering texture of connection) and embodied sensory work (hand pressed to lens, vibrations traveling up his arm). However, his agency remains largely observational until the final moment, where the realization "the texture of connection wasn't something to be discovered" arrives as assertion rather than through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; the character mostly contemplates rather than struggles between competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's grief is embodied through his tools and the mourning rings, but his inner contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—he moves from picking at wounds to following clues to acceptance in sequential stages rather than wrestling with opposing impulses. The choice to press the stencil to his wrist at the end is asserted more than earned by prior micro-choices that show him resisting or testing the cost of letting go. Liora's voice delivering the key insight ("let them wither … bloom again") arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than emerging from his own struggle, and the immediate emotional resolution ("the weight in his chest loosening") reads too tidy for the grief established.

    Lira's interiority is richly textured with embodied detail (ink-stained cuffs, trembling hands), and her trait of "steadily curious" drives her forward into mapping the deck. However, motivation remains largely exploratory rather than decisively tested—she observes, arranges, and sends a single-word reply, but no high-stakes choice with visible cost emerges on the page. The ending hovers at the threshold of engagement without a final act that forecloses a prior path or dramatizes internal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared (pursuing forbidden knowledge, purifying the archive) but her interior work reads abstract and label-heavy—"anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia"—without embodied contradiction driving micro-choices. The ending pivot ("You have to let go") arrives via Kael's wisdom rather than Elara's earned struggle; her agency at closure is passive reception. The child functions as a plot device delivering insight rather than a pressure that forces Elara into a renunciation with visible cost shaped by her prior contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is grounded in his observational practice and sustained by his theory about shadows, but his final choice—merging the footage—feels more like a discovery than a decision with competing costs. The "softly deliberate" movements are claimed rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His motivation to preserve hope is clear, but the ending smile arrives without visible forfeit or renunciation that would earn the shift. The stone's warming and rolling feel symbolic rather than tied to a specific micro-choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—his trembling hands, his choice to trim rather than reconstruct, his movement from softness to boundary-setting. The interior monologue "You only lost a piece of yourself. I lost the whole illusion" risks therapy-speak, but the subsequent physical action (setting down the brush, picking up tweezers) dramatizes the shift with embodied cost. The chameleon functions well as a mirror for his internal state without becoming a mere symbol. The ending gesture of writing suggests a stance shift, though the cost of that shift could be more visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is grounded in embodied detail (scar-tracing, breath fogging) and the plant-telepathy trait creates a consistent perceptual lens. Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously seeks closure yet keeps walking into the tunnel against the moss's warning, showing competing impulses. However, the final beat—understanding that "the miracle hadn't been lost" and reading coffee rings—arrives without prior dramatized struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path, reading more as epiphany than earned alteration. The change feels declared rather than compelled by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation (finding where unused love is stored) is clear and drives her method, but her interiority leans heavily on declarative exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The psychometry scene offers sensory detail ("weight of a held breath") yet the character's emotional arc remains relatively smooth—she moves from waiting to vision to promise without meaningful internal friction. The vision of the star and composer provides backstory texture, but Mira's own stakes feel more intellectual than viscerally conflicted. The ending choice (reaching for the pen) arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that would elevate the renunciation or decision into Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora remains a labeled "moonstruck dreamer" without interiority that contradicts or complicates her arc. Her trapped creativity is asserted repeatedly in near-identical phrasing ("threads tangling," "weight of deadlines") but we see no embodied struggle—no aborted drafts, no concrete attempt. The breakthrough arrives as summary ("stories came back…not in fragments, but in whole, vivid images") without a single on-page micro-choice or visible cost; she simply kneels and the problem vanishes. The closure renunciation (discarding the instrument) lacks causal grounding in prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows interiority through his approach to the archive, but his thirty-seven years without dreams remains largely ornamental label rather than dramatized contradiction. The shift from passive guard to spark-cultivator happens too cleanly without visible internal friction or cost—he "understood, or thought he did" glosses the turn. Embodied emotion is sparse; the moment he touches the clock and the world flickers needed visceral disorientation to ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.7)
    The philosopher lacks interiority and contradiction; his decisions read as passive discovery rather than choice under pressure. The "sixth sense awakened" and subsequent movements feel declared rather than dramatized through embodied cost. The guardian encounter offers no visible friction or micro-choice that would test motive—the philosopher simply listens and steps forward. The final step "into the wild frontier" lacks visible renunciation or trade-off; it reads as inevitable acceptance without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior is shadowed by abstractions ("unused courage waits," "something inside her had cracked") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ticket-punch action feels symbolic rather than a micro-choice under pressure. Elias remains wise-guide flat, his motivations unexamined. The final step forward reads as gesture without visible cost foreclosing a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state is present but largely told through exposition about nerve regeneration and past trauma rather than contradictory impulses acting in the present scene. His motivation to understand "the cost of safety" remains abstract until the final beats. The signing exchanges with Madame Veyra offer some embodied choice, but the protagonist functions more as investigator than agent under pressure—he observes, follows clues, and finally turns away without a visible cost that forecloses a live option. Emotional progression relies on summary of past silence rather than present embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her purpose-driven competence reads as consistent, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"weight of her purpose," "sharp enough to cut"—without embodied contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The scroll discovery feels more procedural than conflicted; no micro-choice forces a visible tradeoff. The year-long investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, and the final smile lacks the cost or renunciation that would ground her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand the erasure is clear and her finger-tapping tic provides embodied texture. However, internal conflict remains largely absent—she pursues a mystery without meaningful competing impulses or visible hesitation. The final smile and determination feel asserted rather than earned through contradictory wants tested under pressure. The choice to continue lacks visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interiority is concrete and embodied—toes curling, breath hitching—but internal contradiction is minimal; her determination reads as a single stance rather than simultaneous opposing impulses. The grandmother's memory provides backstory that primes the closure choice, though the leap from "the fighters forgot their magic" to pressing her palm on the stone feels more asserted than earned by on-page micro-choices. The final moment of hope is embodied ("quiet certainty") but the path from solitary wanderer to world-reigniter could use one more visible cost or foreclosed option to reach the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to "evolve tradition" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her defiance reads coherent but monolithic—no visible cost between desire and fear appears on the page. The plant-voice ability is label-only until the unsealing; it constrains no prior choice. Lina's "what have you done?" arrives too late to test Mira's stance with relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interiority is specific and embodied through physical markers—memorizing stem pressure, breath hitching when roots take hold. Her endurance arc is earned through micro-choices (burying the photograph, watering the cutting) that show contradictory impulses: rejecting healing while staying to learn propagation. The final stance—belief in "something harder, something real"—is motivated by accumulated somatic anchors rather than epiphany. Minor: Mira remains somewhat instrumental, her motivation stated more than dramatized through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—the portrait erasure sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (clinging to the woman's memory while erasing her face). The redesign choices (cards, portrait) demonstrate agency under pressure. However, the motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" feels abstract and arrives pre-formed rather than emerging through dramatized friction. The final act of drawing "the shape of the ache" lands as earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias demonstrates some embodied particularity—the pale fingers, albino eyes sharp as broken glass—but his interiority leans heavily on generic tracker competence and serene anger that never complicates his choices. The woman and child remain functional props with no contradictory impulses. His decision to track "them" at the end feels declared rather than earned through a hierarchy of conflicting values tested on the page. The "consciously wild" trait and "why time slows in crisis" motive remain label-only claims without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his professional background shapes his choices, but his final decision—planting the letter—feels more like fulfilling a conceptual premise than an embodied contradiction. "Bravely conflicted" is stated rather than dramatized through simultaneous opposing impulses in the peak beat. The stakes around "provoke an unspoken conversation" remain abstract; we don't see what he personally risks or loses by this act, only what the Order might eventually confront.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority shows some embodied contradiction—she seeks continuity while carrying her father's violence-lessons—but the arc feels predetermined rather than emergent from moment-to-moment pressure. The final gesture (handing him the rose) reads more symbolic than causally earned by micro-choices that alter stance. The father remains a silhouette; his "something other than calculation" flicker lacks specificity or cost. Backstory volume is high (~25%) but anchored adequately; the present-tense micro-choices (kneeling, holding out the sandbag, pressing the rose) tilt stance enough to avoid routing a BRR penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's cool-headed trait is established early and maintained, but his interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The final moment where he "voices silence" feels more mystical than character-driven—we don't see him struggle with a genuine choice that forecloses a meaningful path. His embodied experience is vivid ("the reed pulsed beneath his fingers") but the internal conflict between wants and fears never truly materializes on the page. The change at closure reads as externally imposed rather than earned through prior psychological causality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular (the nib's weight "like holding her father's hand again"), and her micro-choices (writing three letters, pressing the nib into wax) reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is present—grief versus investigative drive—but operates sequentially rather than simultaneously in most beats. The final choice to step into light feels motivated but the cost is more asserted than dramatized on the page. Embodied emotion is strong in the nib-handling beats but some passages slip into label-only feelings ("the weight of orbits she could no longer ignore").

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt over his sister's infant is grounded in concrete detail (the car plunging into the river, unsent letters), and his ritual of tattooing constellations embodies his need to contain sound. However, the internal contradiction—wanting to silence cries while building a machine that amplifies them—reads more as convenient irony than psychologically earned mistake. The final shift ("he had finally listened") arrives without a clear on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path; the tattooing completes, but what decision or renunciation tips him from torment to quiet is elided. The embodied moment of the needle burning is vivid, yet the causal link between inking amber-mixed constellations and achieving peace remains abstractly asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking pattern/meaning in chaos—and her social perceptiveness is embodied in specific observations (slump of a shoulder, eyelid flicker, mist moods). Internal conflict appears but remains abstract: her drive to "discover meaning" doesn't generate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (pressing the tile flake, stilling the mandala) feels more enacted than earned by prior on-page struggle; Maren's interjection shifts Liora's stance, but the cost of that shift is implied rather than viscerally dramatized. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes tips into label-speak ("throat tight," "stomach clench").

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is established through her retrocognitive trait and her renaming habit, but the core choice at the ending—placing the lapis tessera where *Amira* had been—arrives without sufficient internal contradiction dramatized in scene. The passage "between the girl who'd burned the world and the woman who was rebuilding it. Between vengeance and mercy" reads as expository summary rather than embodied struggle. The final act of placing the stone feels more symbolic gesture than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost, capping the score in the mid-6 range.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's synesthesia is vividly embodied ("deep violets and burnt oranges," "tasted like lightning") and his motivation to help Liora is clear. However, his internal conflict is thin—he moves through the climactic beat without meaningful cost or hesitation, making the final choice feel unmotivated rather than earned. Liora's desire for an encore is dramatized through her flickering form and the echoes, but her agency dissolves when she becomes a passive recipient of Elias's magic. The ending lacks a visible price that would ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's initial skepticism ("Prove it") and her decision to map the pill's effects through paint show trait-driven choices. The final moment where she says "Prove it" again while believing demonstrates a shift, but the middle beats rely heavily on sensation description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Eli remains largely passive, serving as witness rather than applying pressure. The embodied work is strong (muscovite weight, sternum press), but internal conflict reads more as sequential description than live contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's motivation to map and translate the unknown is clear and drives her into the caves, but her interior life leans toward abstract mysticism ("weight against her ribs," "voice like wind through dead branches") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "become its vessel" feels more accepted than earned through visible struggle; she admits she isn't ready, then immediately understands and merges without on-page friction. The embodied emotion is present (breath shallow, pulse hammering) but the peak moment skips the cost of renouncing autonomy—she's swallowed and wakes with warm fossil, no visible price paid in the merge itself.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation—spinning a prophecy into raw possibility—is established through concrete actions (turning the hourglass, cataloging buttons), and her refusal to gasp or smile at the reversal shows earned restraint. However, her interior life remains thin; the seven-year tenure and the moment she "first unscrewed the lid" are told rather than dramatized, and no contradictory impulses complicate her steady patience. The final choice to turn the hourglass over again forecloses wonder in favor of continuation, a credible stance, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior contradiction between prudent calculation and the final risk is present but largely told through reflective summary rather than dramatized pressure. The micro-choice to open the pillbox and use the key shows agency, but the cost—leaving behind the pillbox—reads more symbolic than visceral. Embodiment is intermittent: the scar-tracing gesture is strong, but emotion often surfaces as label ("felt the tilt...not as a threat, but as an invitation") rather than action. The reflection-heavy structure (≥30% of text) does anchor in present stimuli and tilts stance at closure, avoiding BRR penalties, but interiority leans toward epiphany-speak in places ("learning to see the light through them").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is presented with clear interiority—his habit of listening to ambient cues, his utility-driven relationship to objects. The motivation to "distill complexity into essence" operates mostly as a declared trait rather than a lived contradiction under pressure; his final serenity arrives without a visible micro-choice that forecloses an alternate path. The yarn needle is textured by memory but never forces a trade-off; his stitching is practical maintenance, not a crucible moment. The wife's absence is evoked beautifully but remains atmospheric rather than creating an on-page tension that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ren's interiority is consistently filtered through craft and observation, with concrete embodiment in his clay-work and attention to fractured light. The motivation to follow kindness and persistent life shows in micro-choices (carrying the lantern, tending the oasis), though the final transformation—bowl filled with honey, glass whole—arrives without a visible internal struggle or foreclosed path that would demonstrate cost. The "phototropic to kindness" trait is told rather than tested under pressure; no moment forces Ren to choose between competing goods or pay a price for his drawn-to-life stance. Minor: "He had learned to follow the sun's patterns" is expository summary rather than embodied skill demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior voice shows specificity in his gardening choices and relationship to decay, with embodied gestures (wiping hands, brushing the bitting gauge). The exchange with Lila crystallizes his renunciation—giving away his father's tool—with visible cost that forecloses connection to his past. However, the interiority relies heavily on metaphor-stacking ("reflecting light into dark corners," "endings were just beginnings in disguise") that edges toward therapy-speak at peak moments. Lila's arrival and her father's death feel functional but her grief is told more than embodied, weakening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is articulated but operates primarily through reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice—reading the book and accepting the past—arrives without visible internal friction or embodied cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("weight of a thousand lives," "brittle") rather than character-particular sensation, and the journey reads more as contemplation than struggle with genuine mistakes or blind spots under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's occupation as a ghostwriter is established but her interior life reads as abstracted meditation rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice—writing her own letter—arrives without prior micro-choices that test competing impulses; the shift feels declared rather than earned through visible cost. Relationships with the keeper and artist remain at arm's length, serving as oracles rather than applying direct pressure. Embodied emotion is thin; much of her interiority operates in figurative register without concrete sensation or stakes-driven hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear (outwit tricksters) and her choice to use subsonic frequencies is on-page, but her interiority reads generic—"trembling fingers," "breath fogging glass"—without contradictory impulses or character-particular perception. The final micro-smile and "cautiously hopeful" label appear as told states rather than embodied cost. Voss shifts from smug to awed too smoothly, without internal friction or a visible trade-off that would earn the change. The decision to activate the signal carries stakes but no genuine struggle or foreclosed path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia is embodied early ("squeezing his ribs until his vision blurred"), and his movement through the Nexus shows goal-driven behavior. The final choice—grasping the compass despite the warning—forecasts a decisive shift, but the piece withholds on-page consequence: we see realization ("The Nexus wasn't a ruin. It was a ship") but no follow-through action or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward discovery-mode rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's face-blindness and methodical approach are established, but her character work relies heavily on assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The interiority uses some stock phrasing ("her pulse quickened," "her stomach twisted") without distinct perceptual texture. The final choice to draw the lance into Liora's portrait feels more thematic than earned by prior on-page struggle; we see method, not genuine internal conflict that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven through most beats ("nervous confidence" embodied in trembling fingers, determination to decipher journals). The final choice to continue Elias's work feels somewhat abrupt—"whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started" reads as announced rather than earned through contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Elias's backstory is vividly reconstructed but remains largely reflective; Mira's present micro-choices (finding the nail, unlocking the furnace) advance plot without deep internal contradiction under pressure. The ending hovers between decision and deferral, weakening the sense of visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is consistently textured through her musical and observational lens, with embodied detail ("strings humming against the damp wool of her scarf"). Her motivation to "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" drives her stance but never faces meaningful contradiction or cost that would force a harder choice. The hitchhiker remains a static prompt rather than a pressure source, and Lena's final decision to follow the road feels like continuation rather than transformation earned by prior causality. Internal conflict is present as theme but not as simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific, particularly in his relationship to his father's legacy and the foreign bills. The moment of spreading the bills across the floor and the decision to leave carry embodied weight. However, the reflection-heavy design means key micro-choices remain understated; the fox watching him go charges the exit but the protagonist's shift from observer to actor needed sharper definition. The father remains vivid through objects and memory without direct scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is presented with consistent traits (chronicler, healer-with-words) and a clear goal, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The turn—from decoding symbols to recognizing an invitation to share burdens—is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is clear but the final act (gathering dreamers) happens off-page, weakening the sense of earned agency with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests his stance in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's interiority shows internal conflict (forest vs. city, loyalty vs. truth) embodied in specific memories and physical interaction with the seed. The progression from hesitance to confession reads as earned, though the peak moment—"I let them die"—edges toward declarative summary rather than dramatized realization. The revelation that raiders were her kin lands with visible cost, and the final encounter with the grown child forecloses reconciliation. Minor slip: "warlike serenity" as an emotional label rather than contradictory impulses shown in simultaneous action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is present but relies on abstract metaphors ("visions bleeding into soil") and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to take the woman's hand feels unmotivated by prior causality—no micro-choices or visible internal conflict earn the shift from solitary dreamer to partner. The woman from his visions materializes without resistance or surprise, flattening what should be a high-stakes confrontation. Label-only traits ("purposefully curious") don't constrain on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (carving sigils, pressing coins into skulls), and her internal conflict between preserving her brother's memory and saving him drives the climactic choice. The memory bargain creates genuine contradiction—she must sacrifice what she's trying to recover. The stranger remains functional but flat, serving only as transaction mechanism. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost (losing the exact memory that sustains her quest), though the phantom-weight description edges toward stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jake's interiority shows contradictory impulses—clinging to the grille cloth while claiming facts are better insulation—but the late arrival of Lena introduces a second character without sufficient prior grounding, making her appearance feel convenient rather than earned. The backstory dominates the first half, delaying present-tense micro-choices that could have sharpened his internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present in "fingers twitched toward his pocket" and the bitter laugh, but therapeutic self-awareness ("facts were better insulation than feelings") edges toward label-speak. The final exchange with Lena offers a micro-turn, yet her sudden presence and the lack of prior stakes around her undercut the cost of Jake's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in methodical curiosity, and the final act of planting the seed and translating the script demonstrates agency with visible cost (emotional closure: "her eyes stinging"). However, interiority often defaults to stock phrasing—"her heart ached with the touching distance," "her kindly methodical mind"—rather than character-particular embodiment. The choice to press the seed feels somewhat inevitable rather than forced by contradictory impulses; her competence proceeds without genuine misstep or internal friction that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve wonder is stated clearly, and his titan-gear form offers vivid embodiment. However, the actual choices are contemplative rather than conflicted—he fills the creel methodically without internal resistance or visible cost. The restlessness under the waxing gibbous is mentioned but never dramatized as a pressure that complicates his actions. The ending renunciation (setting the creel adrift) reads as serene completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inspector's interiority is present—fear of being forgotten, purpose clarifying across the arc—but lacks contradiction acting *in scene*. Her choices (touching pearl to confessions, placing crown on her own head) arise smoothly without competing impulses or visible hesitation that would charge the moment. The confession "I'm afraid of being forgotten" arrives as a stated insight rather than an embodied cost that forecloses a path. Embodiment is gestural but lacks the micro-choice friction that would lift the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's guilt over the drowning and her methodical map-making show clear motivation, and the decision to stop medication to "write the truth" grounds her choices. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous knowledge that the map is "useless" yet continuing to draw it. However, the protagonist remains largely passive through the piece—she traces graffiti, plays accordion, reads her own map—without facing a pressure that forces a high-stakes choice. The final walk toward the river reads as continuation rather than alteration or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The veiled dreamer remains an observational presence rather than an agent making pressure-driven choices; her "cautious exuberance" is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The confidence man's watch and cipher function as atmospheric props rather than constraints that force micro-choices with visible cost. The final "set her free" moment lacks earned causality—no prior choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page, and the transformation from veiled to unveiled reads as assertion rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is vivid and embodied—her hands shaking, breath fogging—and the dream-versus-empire tension drives her choices on the page. The plants' telepathic urgency pushes her toward the climactic act, and her final smile shows credible alteration. However, the father's abrupt vanishing and the plants' sudden shift from screaming to quiet deflate the cost; we don't see her register the loss or the moral weight of what she's done, weakening the closure's felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's profession is established but her interiority remains abstract—"quiet defiance of holding on" and "heart aching with the beauty" are label-only emotions rather than embodied contradictions. The ritual with the emerald chip proceeds without internal friction or cost to her; she succeeds cleanly, which flattens agency. The figure's revival feels like a plot event rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No visible renunciation or trade-off emerges on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira's motivation to seek contentment is established, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract reflection ("forgiveness was not the same as contentment") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—pressing the hairpin into water—lacks visible cost; she climbs back "lighter," suggesting relief without foreclosing a path. Micro-choices (kneeling, dipping fingers, pressing the hairpin) advance the plot but don't reveal a hierarchy of competing values under pressure. The piece tells us she has "never tended herself" rather than dramatizing the insight through conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is reasonably concrete—the mirror shard pulsing, the cloak tightening—and his final realization (Veyra wants understanding, not absolution) emerges from the scene's pressure. However, the trait "conscience for hire" functions mainly as a label; no on-page choice demonstrates how this role constrains or enables a specific tactic under stress. The emotional progression from scoffing skepticism to listening carries some embodied contradiction, but the decision to ask "Tell me what you're afraid of" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's fear is named ("afraid of failing, afraid of succeeding") but remains abstract; we never see a micro-choice where competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The grandmother backstory arrives as summary rather than embodied conflict. The final transformation ("hands of a woman half her age") tells outcome without showing the contradictory pull of wanting versus fearing youth, and the "understanding" epiphany lacks concrete cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias exhibits consistent motivation and patient observation, but interiority remains abstract—"understanding the pulse left wandering" and "the art of moving without motion" feel more like theme statements than embodied thought. His final smile and decision to "wander its echoes forever" arrive without visible internal conflict or cost; no path is foreclosed, no competing impulse dramatized. The piece delivers contemplative endurance but lacks contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life shows concrete detail (numb fingers, threadbare robes, the weight of his satchel as a chain), and his journey from self-doubt to the flower-blooming choice demonstrates earned transformation. However, the mentor figure in the courtyard remains functionally a device rather than a pressuring presence, and the final epiphany—"You're a slow learner. There's a difference"—verges on therapeutic label-speak that dilutes embodied struggle. The choice to plant the drop is motivated, but the path from drinking light to certainty feels abbreviated; the protagonist's internal contradictions resolve too cleanly without sustained friction.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits consistent traits (steady routine-keeper, thirty-seven years of muscle memory) and his discovery of the key tag triggers a clear shift from hollow routine to purposeful action. The woman's arrival introduces relationship pressure, but her exposition ("You've been lighting the lamps for years, but you've never asked why they still matter") flattens what could be embodied tension. The final gesture—pressing the Lumen tag into her hand—reads as closure, but the leap from "I understand" to handing over the key lacks visible internal conflict or cost: no dramatized struggle between keeping the legacy and passing it on. Interiority at peak beats ("his pulse quickened") leans on physiological shorthand rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistently filtered through cosmic metaphors ("wavelength align," "song of the cosmos"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. His micro-choices—tracing coins, scattering lots, closing his fist—embody his shift from "roaring fire" to "quieter, steadier" enthusiasm, though the final choice feels more resigned acceptance than earned transformation with visible cost. The embodied details (breath fogging glass, coin warming in palm) ground the abstract stakes. Internal contradiction is present but operates at a conceptual level rather than forcing a visceral on-page trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias as a "heartbroken reaper" pursuing names for nameless fears is conceptually clear but remains abstract throughout. His interior consists largely of philosophical statements ("the dead had no need of memory") and metaphors ("like shards of glass") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses in scene. The final act of naming monsters and feeling relief reads as told epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. His want (to give names) never conflicts credibly with a competing impulse or obstacle that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his naïveté drives his approach to the bell. The interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("brittle devotion," "lukewarm mage") that functions more as metaphoric shorthand than embodied emotion under pressure. The final laugh "as brittle as the bell's devotion" feels like label-speak echoing the concept rather than a dramatized emotional turn. Micro-choices exist (timing water drops, adjusting bell angle) but they read more like procedural detail than contradiction-laden decisions with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to preserve memory is clear, but his interior life trends abstract—"the weight of the past settling into his bones" exemplifies label-only interiority. The photographs-to-closure trajectory is coherent, yet the final choice (carry them back vs. burn them) is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost. The woman Mira and the father exist primarily as backstory fuel; no on-page relationship tests Elias under pressure. Embodied contradiction is absent; he processes the discovery with steady insight rather than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's internal arc is signaled—alchemist learning to release control—but her contradictory impulses are narrated rather than enacted in scene. The memory of the flame offers backstory motivation, yet the kneeling with the crystal reads more as symbolic gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("the touch of wonder," "secretly sentimental") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final smile and resolve arrive without a dramatized struggle that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias functions as a single POV with consistent interiority—"midnight pattern seeker" colors his perception of bark as Braille, clouds as patterns. His motivation ("preserve trust under pressure") drives the climb with embodied cost (buckle biting, shallow gasps), and the final pull upward after the snap earns the endurance. However, the backstory blocks (parachute fall, years of observation) occupy ~25% without clearly tilting a present micro-choice until the harness knot, flattening urgency in the opening third; the "watcher's burden" label recurs without dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "feel something again" is established early and drives his choices through the training sequence. The embodied response during combat—"heat, pressure, pulse of his own blood"—shows concrete progress. However, the epiphany that "numbness wasn't his enemy—it was the canvas" arrives via Master Veyra's wisdom rather than emerging from Kael's own struggle, and the final step off the dojo edge feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past as a conductor, but his interior life trends toward summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The girl's silent wonder and the mother's rusty laugh provide embodied emotion at closure, though the protagonist's trembling hands and exhaled relief remain somewhat abstract. The final choice to walk away feels earned by the setup, but the weight of renunciation could be more visceral. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weight of unspoken things," "tended to them like a gardener") that dilutes character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's dimensional homesickness and uncertainty-seeking are established early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("dimensional homesickness," "waiting her whole life") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice—ceasing to wait—lacks visible cost; the text asserts change without showing what path she foreclosed or what she traded. Minor win: the pendant's cold weight and her kneeling to the book provide concrete anchors, but peak beats drift into therapy-speak ("make friends with uncertainty") that flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—his hands "trembled," the ledger is "a graveyard of numbers"—and his shift from perfectionism to embracing destruction is motivated by twenty years of failure. However, the pivot feels slightly abrupt: the phrase "creative destruction" arrives as a serpent-thought rather than emerging from prior micro-choices, and the final stillness ("Elias didn't flinch") reads more like label than embodied contradiction. The core arc is credible but leans on telling at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her search is embodied through concrete actions (adjusting dials, pressing the fragment). However, her final "choice" to remain as the tower falls reads passive—she "didn't flinch" and "was already somewhere else" without an active decision or visible internal struggle at that moment. The epiphany "the beginning wasn't a moment to be found, but a state to be returned to" arrives as assertion rather than emerging from a contested choice under pressure. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("origins are illusions") rather than character-specific contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is consistently characterized as "resiliently positive" and ardent, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("believed in the light that slipped through the cracks") rather than embodied contradiction. The hourglass functions as a talisman but never constrains a choice with visible cost; his final act of speaking to the commuters feels more like narration than a decision that forecloses options. Captain Veyra is present but applies no pressure that alters Elias's stance. The ending resets the ferry without dramatizing what Elias renounced or gained.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover the texture of connection") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His actions—touching the thread, following it—feel reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The fever dream architect role is a label that doesn't constrain choices; he could be any artist and the beats would play identically. The ending offers a sensation but no visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirien's motivation is coherent—she is drawn to alien navigation methods—but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The shift from doubt to resolve ("Then we will make them ours") arrives quickly without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices during experimentation are summarized ("slow work, fraught with failure") rather than dramatized with visible cost, and the elder Tael's reversal lacks earned causality. The final choice feels asserted rather than compelled by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to find Miriam is rooted in her role and the photograph, and her persistence drives the narrative forward. However, her choices lack meaningful internal contradiction—she moves steadily toward the mist without wrestling with competing fears or costs. The final smile feels unearned; no prior causality establishes why she would welcome the dead's chorus or what personal stake makes this moment transformative rather than simply resolved. Embodied emotion is present but surfaces as gestures (breath hitching, fingers tightening) rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to return and stand by is anchored in backstory (the collapse, the screaming) but his present choices lack internal friction—the decision to step through the phase transition and kneel beside the researchers reads more as mystical surrender than a choice with competing impulses. Interiority is atmospheric ("weight of the corridors pressing in," "claustrophobia a live wire") but edges toward abstract rather than embodied contradiction. The ending forecloses action with visible cost (he drowns, the facility seals), satisfying the closure requirement, yet the sequence of decisions leading there feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle between wants.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are established through concrete anchors (death certificate, porcelain shard, heartbeat counting), and his internal state is embodied rather than labeled. The heartbeat counting operates as a character-particular tic that reveals his anxiety about borrowed time. However, the final "space between mistakes" realization feels somewhat unearned—the ghost delivers wisdom rather than Elias discovering it through concrete choice or renunciation with visible cost. The piece leans toward passive reception of insight rather than active transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to capture echoes is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—"texture given voice" is poetic yet lacks embodied contradiction or visceral cost during the peak moment. The humming-conducting sequence shows agency, but the triumph feels too smooth; no genuine struggle or blind spot complicates her success. The final smile and "quietly articulate" tag read as external performance rather than contradictory interior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows embodied tension—the arrowhead warm in his pocket, fingers going translucent—and his final choice to press the phone to his ear despite Maren's warning demonstrates agency under pressure. The "bitter and bright" smile at the end lands as character-particular. However, his profession as "cryptid researcher" and the backstory about "the missing return" feel more setup than lived contradiction; we see observation more than internal conflict driving micro-choices in scene. Maren remains functional but underdeveloped, her "gnarled roots" hands a token detail.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivations are clear—she's trapped in a cycle of playing to preserve the orchard—but her decision to flee feels abrupt rather than earned through layered contradiction. The locust shell triggers the break, yet we don't see her wrestle with abandoning the statues or the orchard she's protected for seven years. The child at the end provides a fresh stake, but Liora's interior voice remains somewhat generic, relying on abstract epiphanies ("beauty wasn't something to be coaxed back—it was something to be seized") rather than embodied struggle. Minor embodiment present (breath hitches, fingers tightening) but under-developed for the weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jace's interior is present but often tells rather than embodies: "he recognized the look in her eyes—the same one he'd seen in the mirror every morning" summarizes what could be shown through action. The choice to help Mira is inherited routine rather than a live decision under pressure; his stance crystallizes in the final image ("Some promises couldn't be kept. But some could be carried"), but the shift from passive carrying to active complicity feels asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Mira's defiance is labeled but her choices (arriving late, producing the jammer) lack visible cost or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's defining trait—silence as language—is established early and shapes his action at closure (placing the fragment, singing), but the internal contradiction is thin: he's labeled "quietly persistent" yet his resistance to or cost of singing isn't dramatized beyond a single "urge." The trait functions more as atmospheric label than lived tension. The change from silence to song lacks a visible foreclosed path or embodied struggle that would earn the transformation at 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his odd-hour librarian persona shapes his perceptual lens, but his agency at closure feels passive—he follows the scarf rather than choosing under pressure. The woman's arrival in the void resolves her search via discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interior contradiction is minimal; his adjustment of glasses and reshelving gestures anchor him, but no micro-choice under stress reveals competing values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is rendered through concrete images (light as "golden, fleeting," the palette humming) and his progression from passive dreaming to active pursuit shows motivation, but the internal contradiction needed to elevate this into high bands is absent—he moves smoothly from discovery to action without competing impulses. The final exchange ("Not yet," he said. "But I will.") gestures at renunciation but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. The woman remains a cipher rather than a pressure source, limiting relationship-as-crucible work. Embodied emotion is present but leans decorative ("salt spray," "liquid amber") rather than driving micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith remains cipher-like throughout; his motivation and internal contradiction never surface beyond professional competence. Elara's paralysis is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final smile reads as a tidy emotional resolution without visible cost or genuine struggle that would foreclose a path. Minor positive: the locksmith's action of holding hair to starlight shows embodied ritual, though it lacks personal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to recover stolen memories is clear and drives his return to the greenhouse. His interiority shows embodied detail ("pressed his palm to the damp earth," "breath fogging") and the final moment where he reaches for Liora carries weight. However, the sister's sudden reappearance lacks sufficient grounding in Elias's internal contradiction—his desperate fight at thirteen is told rather than felt in the present crisis. The choice to reach for her feels inevitable but not deeply conflicted, missing the simultaneous pull of contradictory impulses that would elevate this to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior life is concrete and embodied—"combative tenderness," the smell of ink and old paper, walking backwards as evasion—and her contradictory impulses (exile by choice, the fear of failing another apprentice) act simultaneously in scene. The final gesture of handing Mira the teacup demonstrates a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses the safety of isolation. Minor deduction: Mira's interiority remains thin, serving primarily as catalyst rather than full character, and the phrase "reversible exile she could end at any moment" veers toward exposition that tells rather than shows the stakes through action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority relies heavily on lyric abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The piece tells us she is "wise" and "insatiably creative" without dramatizing those traits through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation at the end—understanding the seed as vessel—arrives via perception shift rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The travelers' echoes function more as atmospheric decoration than pressure that tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows embodied emotion—trembling fingers, cold breath—and his internal conflict between restoration and destruction emerges clearly at the needle moment. The Fisher King's late arrival feels more like a construct to deliver thematic opposition than an earned character with his own interiority; his warning "Some things should stay buried" reads as authorial thesis rather than motivated stance. Elias's secret—hearing the mask's voices in his dreams—arrives too late to shape prior choices and functions as justification rather than complication. The final act (driving the needle in) forecloses a path with visible cost, but the choice feels inevitable rather than genuinely conflicted given the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's observational gift and empathy are clearly established, and his decision to reopen the chapel is motivated by his years of interpreting silence. However, the internal contradiction and embodied emotion remain thin—his methodical curiosity never complicates his choice with genuine cost or hesitation on the page. The final beat ("the story was not yet finished") is more epiphany-statement than a choice that forecloses a path, and the shoe discovery feels like recognition rather than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows embodied interiority—"Death had been his first name" grounds the piece—and his analytic approach is visible in parsing equations. The ghost encounter strains motivation: his acceptance of Liora's appearance lacks visceral surprise or embodied terror, flattening a pivotal beat. The final choice to shatter the globe reads as prompted by the ghost's directive rather than internal contradiction, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to give voice to the ghost is consistent and his action (playing the lute, pressing the bolt plate into the ghost's hand) drives the story. However, his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses complicate his choices, and the decision to stay and play feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle. The ghost's transition from shimmer to woman lacks embodied cost for Elias; he smiles and plays on, but we don't see what this encounter forecloses or what he sacrifices. The final choice reads more as gentle completion than a decision with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira's curiosity and risk-taking are shown through concrete choices (borrowing goggles, deciphering the diary, entering the captain's quarters). The final decision to leave the goggles and diary behind is earned, though her shift from "seeking answers" to acceptance feels slightly quick given her prior intensity. The captain's grief is handled with specificity through the sketches and cracked goggles. Interior moments occasionally lean toward explanation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistently poetic and embodied through his cloud categorization system, but the final choice—climbing the railing—feels unmotivated by prior causality. The vision of the *Astraea* triggers the decision, yet no prior beat establishes why seeing his father's ship would lead to letting go rather than further observation. Internal contradiction is present (escape vs. witness), but the renunciation lacks visible cost because we don't see what he's foreclosing. The shift from trembling hands to steady resolve happens in a single paragraph without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is consistent and rooted in her prosopagnosia, shaping how she perceives the world through negative space and physical markers. Her decision not to take the sketch feels earned by her artistic philosophy established early. However, the choice lacks visible cost—no dramatized struggle, no forfeited path that we see collapse. The emotional progression is clean but the final renunciation reads more as philosophical affirmation than a choice that forecloses something she wanted.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—earning his cartographer's sigil—and his curiosity drives him to investigate the hopscotch board. His excitement when making the discovery feels genuine and embodied ("hands shaking with excitement"). However, the character remains largely reactive; Orlan's revelation does the heavy lifting at the end, and Elias's internal contradictions or flaws never materially complicate his choices. The apprentice role fits but doesn't generate enough friction to elevate the work.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of repair") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His interior life remains abstract—"metallic whispers promising answers," "understanding why the library had called to him"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final realization ("he was not just a locksmith; he was a bridge") reads as a convenient epiphany rather than one earned through specific struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending gestures at understanding without showing what he sacrifices or what option he now cannot choose.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her arc from ghostly gardener to orchestrator unfolds in summary beats ("she began to write," "she watched as they worked") without embodied struggle or internal friction. The villagers' transformations are label-only ("A farmer who had once hoarded fruit now shared it freely") and lack micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. The final smile and fade read as earned stasis without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire resisted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established (stretching time before the end), and his final choice to whisper through the pane carries symbolic weight. However, the interiority remains abstract—"the weight of what he was about to do" and "bruised awe" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The puppet-as-mirror realization ("It was like him") arrives cleanly but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would show competing impulses in action. The choice to hum feels more thematic than dramatized through credible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear—bound by curse, driven by guilt over past failures—and her final choice to guide via nuts rather than direct contact shows agency with visible cost (she must trust the system and watch from distance). Interiority is concrete ("guilt sat in her chest like a stone") and her micro-choices (pocketing the nut without thought, scattering them quickly) reveal character under pressure. Internal conflict between her lack of love for the lost and the curse's demand for balance creates contradictory impulses that drive the scene. The man's desperation and shift to understanding when he sees the nut adds secondary pressure, though his presence is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina's interior contradiction (walls versus bridges, control versus flow) is present and embodied through her handling of the chrysalis and observation of foam. The polymer-chemist lens colors her perception consistently. However, the epiphany arrives without sufficient on-page struggle—her shift from rigid bonds to flexible ones feels declared rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice. The final decision to return lacks visible sacrifice; we don't see what she relinquishes to move forward.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has a clear internal want (to find where stories begin) and faces a transaction that tests it, but his interior remains abstract and label-driven ("mindfully scattered," "question without an answer"). The woman dissolves into metaphor without earned cost—her unraveling carries no visible sacrifice or trade-off that alters Elias's options. Interiority relies on poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's grief-processing through "sandpapering rough memories" and her choice to share Kael's pain through touch show clear motivation, embodied through the salt-sting and phantom ache. However, the emotional contagion mechanic (feeling his daughter's drowning) arrives as fully-formed backstory rather than building contradiction on the page. The final choice—"remembering her without drowning in it"—edges toward therapeutic label-speak and lacks the visible cost of what Maren forfeits by taking on his burden. Kael's arc from stasis to motion is clean but his interiority remains thin; we see his grief described more than enacted in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivations are clear (connect isolated workers through song and language) but her arc lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle—she moves purposefully from idea to execution without meaningful friction. The "empathetic decisiveness" trait remains label-only; we never see cost or hesitation in her choices. Her grandfather's choir backstory anchors the present choice but reads expository. The ending's community transformation lacks personal cost to Mara, making the change feel externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's internal stance is clear—a shift from collector to modifier—but the emotional throughline relies heavily on reflective assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The woman-in-the-mirror encounter offers promising friction, yet Lena's final choice to preserve the cracks feels arrived-at rather than fought-for; the cost (inheriting the woman's unfinished dream) is told more than shown. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("helix-minded precision flickering between obsession and despair") without grounding the flicker in a concrete micro-choice that alters her present action. The renunciation earns partial credit, but the protagonist's internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would lift this into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is populated with archival metaphors ("prism-minded," "fragments," "seeds of vigilance") that label rather than embody contradiction under pressure. Her choices—adjusting straps, tracing walls, opening the book—remain observational; no on-page dilemma forces a trade-off with visible cost. The final decision to carry the book forward feels declarative rather than earned by prior struggle. Interiority leans toward poetic summary instead of embodied emotion during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to create music is clear and embodied through tactile interaction with wood, but his interior remains more poetic than contradictory—he moves through the scene without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths. The "empathy in motion" realization arrives as a smooth epiphany rather than a choice under pressure. The hedgehog functions as atmospheric witness rather than applying pressure. The final smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's interior world is present through the worry stone anchor and his teaching philosophy, but his choices feel more contemplative than conflicted. The partnership with Lysara lacks genuine friction—both characters arrive with compatible goals and complementary skills, converging too easily. The final decision to stay reads as affirming rather than costly; no live alternative is foreclosed on the page. Lysara's motivations are sketched through exposition ("believed that beauty hid in the difficult") rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation—cataloging silence—is vivid and specific, grounding his actions in a distinct worldview. His relationship with Liora shows complexity through yearning and restraint, and his renunciation of anger at the end is earned. However, Liora's sudden appearance feels more symbolic than psychologically motivated; her Arctic retreat is told rather than dramatized into a credible choice. The final exchange risks abstract philosophizing ("Some truths are too heavy to speak aloud") that edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to cultivate serenity is clear and drives her toward the seed despite warnings, but her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied in simultaneous impulses. The grandmother's journal revelation provides motivation for the shift, but the epiphany arrives cleanly without the messy cognitive friction expected under genuine pressure. Old Nara's arrival and the journal handoff feel convenient rather than earned by prior causality. The final realization about waiting versus blooming is told rather than discovered through contradictory micro-choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to find the source of resilience is clear, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The physical embodiment is present (harness straps, breath curling), yet key emotional choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted—she simply accepts the echoes' wisdom without visible internal resistance. The arrow tip warming and cooling suggests symbolic state changes but doesn't constrain her decisions with on-page cost. The final smile after the planet inverts lacks the contradictory impulses or visible foreclosure that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is motivated by investigative purpose and the patch motif carries personal history, but his interior life remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The final run shows embodied fear, yet the transformation he witnesses never forces a meaningful internal choice—he observes, documents, and flees. His "foresight in action" mantra is told rather than tested through competing impulses. The piece needed contradictory desires (curiosity vs. survival, duty vs. self-preservation) dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's synesthetic blessing is established and her motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is stated, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract color-perception rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to ring the largest bell feels inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict—she "couldn't fail" is asserted, not dramatized as a trade-off. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, gritted teeth) but the stakes remain somewhat conceptual; no visceral cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page when she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is clearly stated but not deeply embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His journey from trying to seal the tear to learning to weave is a meaningful shift, but the internal conflict between these approaches is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The figure's revelation lands as instruction rather than a discovery earned through Elias's own struggle. Embodied emotion is thin; we get trembling fingers and warmth in his grip, but no contradictory bodily states that reveal competing drives.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to map emotion mathematically is signaled, but his interior contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The borrowed-personality trait operates as a label with atmospheric effects (the poet's voice, the mathematician's precision) rather than constraining a pivotal on-page decision with visible cost. The woman's arrival introduces a second character, but no relationship crucible emerges; her presence does not force Elias into a choice that alters their dynamic or his stance. Embodied emotion is present in the humming fragment and aching teeth, yet the final hollowing reads as summary rather than earned renunciation with legible foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courier's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("weight of its silence," "space between knowing and feeling") rather than embodied contradiction. Her shift from routine deliveries to threshold-crossing feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The mentor backstory remains inert—mentioned but never dramatized as a present friction that alters her stance. Emotional states are labeled more than inhabited under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions is clear and embodied through his physical engagement with the prism and quartz. Internal contradictions emerge between belief and doubt, and his micro-choices (raising the prism, pressing his palm to quartz) show purposeful action under pressure. However, the memory of the grieving man arrives fully formed rather than being discovered through Elias's struggle, which softens agency at the key turn. The final understanding feels more received than earned through on-page contradiction forcing a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("silence was raveling around her," "threads still damp with her own breath") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to leave is presented as inevitable rather than a choice under pressure; we see no moment where she wrestles competing desires on the page. The final realization ("the message had not been for him. It had been for her") arrives as a summary epiphany rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. Kael's skeletal presence provides no relationship pressure, only symbolic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's characterization is consistent but remains at a surface level. His "quietly determined" nature is told through description ("beneath the quiet demeanor burned a fire") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The pivotal mine-sealing sequence shows competent execution but no internal resistance, mistake, or cost that would reveal character complexity under pressure. The final moment ("shoulders a little straighter") gestures at change without foreclosing a live option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear—pulled by dreams to map sensory nexuses—but his interior life relies heavily on atmospheric generalities ("the weight of the question pressing against his ribs") rather than embodied contradiction. The encounter with the scarred alternate self introduces stakes, but the final choice ("Kael made his decision") withholds the actual decision, leaving agency abstract. Embodied emotion is present in breath fogging and scanner work, but the peak moment lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path. The characterization supports the concept but doesn't earn transformation through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows genuine contradiction—carrying a talisman against the dark while actively climbing into haunted spaces—and his micro-choices (placing the sea glass, building the stone reply) carry visible cost tied to grief. The embodied emotion is strong: "luminescent ache," "chest tight." However, the final realization feels more stated than earned through dramatized pressure, and the shift from isolation to connection lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Veyra's motivation is stated clearly but her choices feel more observational than agonistic—she adjusts the lantern, witnesses visions, and laughs, but no visible cost or difficult trade-off is dramatized on the page. The backstory about newspapers exceeds the BRR default (~25% of the text) yet does not anchor a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("breath caught," "promise of storms to come") and the final gesture—stepping into light—is declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's watchfulness and post-surgery restlessness are established, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation rather than embodied contradiction. The donor heart functions more as a poetic premise than a lived constraint that forces micro-choices. The traveler's arrival introduces pressure, but her role remains primarily catalytic; the dye master's final realization ("his search was over") reads as declared epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias displays concrete interiority through embodied sensations (numbness returning to life, warmth spreading) and micro-choices (leaving offerings, pressing the sextant into moonlight). His motivation to teach the tower to remember is established, though the path from maintenance worker to dream-mapper feels more asserted than earned through on-page contradiction or struggle. The final choice to return tomorrow reads as continuation rather than foreclosure with visible cost; the tower shifts from prison to vessel through passive realization rather than a decision that sacrifices an option.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (save the realm) and her final choice to sing despite fear is embodied through trembling voice and raw throat. However, interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("her heart ached," "throat tight") and the villagers remain a faceless collective without individual resistance or contradiction. The keeper's wisdom arrives fully formed without dramatized struggle, and Elara's transformation from hesitant to committed feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits internal contradiction—compassion versus institutional obedience—but the decade-long regret over turning away the woman feels asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure tonight. The "quiet ache that never quite healed" reads as summary; we needed embodied hesitation or bodily resistance when he clutches the invitation. The final choice to leave carries visible cost (abandoning his post), but the empathy trait remains label-heavy: "keenly empathetic nature" is told, and his gentleness with pages doesn't test that trait against a conflicting loyalty in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is well-drawn as a "creeping normality noticer" with distinct perceptual habits, and his interior life feels specific rather than generic. The woman at the tea house remains too thinly sketched—her "heuristically gentle" voice and knowing demeanor verge on archetype without embodied contradiction. The planting gesture at the end offers modest agency, but the choice feels muted rather than forcefully earned by prior contradiction. Interiority is clean and free of therapy-speak, though the epiphany about "stubborn persistence" hovers near summary.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his meticulous nature shows in his actions with the lantern. However, his interior life remains somewhat abstract—he observes and adjusts frequencies but we get few embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The final commitment to preserving the library feels declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off that forecloses another path. His change reads more as affirmation than transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's interior is well-embodied and filtered through her smuggler upbringing; embodied tension ("fingers tightened") and micro-choices (stepping forward, holding up the watch fob) show agency under pressure. Her final realization—"she'd just delayed it"—demonstrates genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor weakness: the men's characterization is thin and functional, and Lena's motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" remains somewhat abstract rather than grounded in a concrete personal want.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's skepticism is established early and her motivation to understand weather-carriers is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on expository backstory (UV glow, taste-sensing discovery, grandfather's stories) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The meeting with the storm-man feels passive; she asks questions but makes no choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final grip on the compass ring is a gesture, not a decision that alters her stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's mnemonic gift is label-only and never constrains a choice; his motivation to "uncork suppressed creativity" feels generic rather than specific to him. The dream offers vivid interiority, but the final choice—turning a dial "with the certainty of muscle memory"—lacks earned causality: we never learn why those numbers, or how he knows them. The step into golden light reads more as passive acceptance than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to find lost conversations is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her refusal of the forgery job establishes a moral line, but the trait "wilts near dishonesty" never constrains an on-page choice—she simply descends the stairs without visible cost or internal friction. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("her heart pounding with the certainty") and the final moment offers discovery without a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a consistent desire to preserve wonder through his sculptures, and his seasonal muteness provides a meaningful constraint. His interiority is concrete ("Its cold bit into his fingers") and his choices—descending for the orb, breaking it to feed the sculpture—are purposeful. However, the internal conflict is muted; he moves through his tasks with minimal genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the final choice feels more like completion of a ritual than a cost-bearing decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's interior life shows embodied contradiction—the ghost of rain he never tasted, the static that "whispers" versus the scream he finally releases—and his final kneeling in ash reads as earned renunciation. The miniaturized fears are concrete, character-particular objects that ground his obsolescence anxiety. However, the motivation arc leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; the decision to burn the box arrives abruptly without a dramatized precipitating choice that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization as a discerning curator who "listens" is established through concrete details (holding the locket, noticing the jiggled lock), but her interiority remains thin—she observes and facilitates rather than undergoes genuine internal conflict. The final choice to wait rather than approach feels passive; no competing impulse or visible cost dramatizes renunciation. Mrs. Hargrove and Mr. Chen provide useful fragments but remain inert exposition devices. Clara's emotional arc in the closure beat carries embodied grief, yet Elara's stance never shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "liberate something, though she hadn't yet admitted it to herself" is opaque and never becomes concrete; her choices feel more like tour-guide movements through symbolic tableaux than urgent need under pressure. The journal-as-encryption metaphor receives telling rather than dramatized stakes. Kael's ghost-dance operates as a puzzle-key device without psychological friction or cost to Elara's stance. The final chamber discovery and her smile of "calm defiance" arrive without visible foreclosure of another path or embodied trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlowe's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the pressed wildflowers, coffee grounds, and lantern-lighting ritual establish his grief and agency. His choice to exhume the journal and pursue the whale's call is motivated by established causality (sister's disappearance, the journal's cryptic message). However, the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final third, and the emotional progression from grief to action lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending's choice (answering the whale's song) feels slightly abrupt, insufficiently grounded in the cost of what he's leaving behind or risking.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The summoner remains more archetype than individual; interiority consists largely of abstract observations ("terrestrially cosmic hum") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to release the prophecy arrives pre-formed rather than emerging through dramatized conflict—no competing impulse acts simultaneously in scene. Emotional states are asserted via stock constructions ("his heart as quiet as the night") without the specificity or irrational layering that would demonstrate genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand Veyra's legacy is clear and her discovery of Mira's identity creates a credible turn. However, her interior life remains somewhat thin—her emotional response to learning Mira is Veyra's daughter is understated ("her pulse quickened") when the moment warrants deeper contradiction or cost. The final choice to "listen" feels more like thematic alignment than a decision that forecloses a visible path. Mira's long deception and her reason for maintaining it ("some truths are too heavy to carry alone") arrive as exposition rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent (archive sister's work, find her), but interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing: "charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant," "translating his isolation into independence." The final choice ("I'm not afraid anymore") arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or cost; the protagonist moves from observing to accepting without a dramatized internal struggle that forecloses a competing path. Liora's appearance as a translucent figure is visually striking but her agency and the relational crucible lack sufficient friction to earn the closure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lian's motivation is clear—preserving family honor through forgery—but her interior life relies heavily on symbolic objects (thorn, key) rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to "forgive the unfinished" arrives as a declared epiphany without prior dramatized ambivalence between revenge and release. Vey's presence forces a choice, but Lian's shift from revenge-adjacent anger to transcendent forgiveness lacks the messy, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation reads earned by setup but not by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's motivation to understand echoes is stated but never tested in concrete choices under pressure. The protagonist remains passive throughout; Veyan arrives with the solution's missing half, and Liora simply accepts and joins. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves from curiosity to collective action without friction, cost, or a visible stake she must forfeit. The final choice to sing feels given rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's profession and interior stance are established early, and her choice to walk away at the end shows agency. However, her motivations remain somewhat abstract—"salvager of echoes" seeking "something pure" reads more as atmospheric labeling than embodied contradiction. The decision to never tell lacks visible cost on the page; we see her exhale and leave, but no dramatized forfeiture of a concrete option or relationship. Internal conflict is asserted ("weaves truth carefully") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ren's contemplative nature is established through concrete actions (net-mending, whisk-carving) and his philosophical stance emerges from particulars. However, the closure choice—"Stay"—arrives without visible internal contradiction or foreclosed alternative; Mei's arrival feels more like wish-fulfillment than a decision that costs Ren something. The "demure audacity" label is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains surface-level: "quiet flame" and "patterns finally make sense" tell rather than show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "excavate truth" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The stranger's pivot from potential antagonist to ally feels unmotivated—no prior causality establishes why they'd help now. Interior states rely on labels ("adrenaline," "pulse quickened") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to accept the diamond lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; Elias simply receives confirmation of what he already suspected.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's envy and longing are asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure; his descent and confrontation feel outlined rather than inhabited. The radio voices guide him without meaningful internal resistance or cost visible in action. The crowd's shift at the end ("their allegiance wavering") is told, not earned through dramatized struggle. Kael exists only as a declared rival, offering no relational friction or on-page exchange to test Elias's contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and concrete through the music box handling and jar-gathering rituals, with embodied loneliness in "hollowed it out just enough to let the light in." His choice to translate silence emerges from prior despair, but the final epiphany arrives as a neat realization rather than a contradictory struggle—he names his purpose ("I'm translating") too cleanly. The girl's arrival feels more like a mirror for his insight than a pressure that forces a costly choice. No diagnostic label-speak appears, keeping the score in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is embodied through concrete actions (adjusting resonator dials, sprinting across docks) and his guilt over his brother surfaces with specificity. However, the scavenger remains functionally flat—her motivations are declared ("trading in forbidden relics") rather than dramatized through competing desires. The final choice to grasp the key feels somewhat rushed; the shift from hesitation to acceptance happens in two brief paragraphs without enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interior voice leans toward elevated diction ("coiled in his chest") that occasionally distances from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established through occupation and prior practice ("twelve winters," "learned to wait"), but interiority remains largely abstract ("patience was not passivity"). The meeting with the stranger lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; neither hesitates nor trades off visible options. Emotional embodiment is thin: "breath curling in the air" is the strongest physical marker, but crisis-level contradiction or hierarchy of values never materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's investigator role and watchful precision are established, but his interiority flattens under pressure. The grandmother's voice and lantern memories feel inserted rather than lived; the metaphor "its light once guiding fugitives to freedom" reads like exposition. His decision to send evidence and re-enter lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost—he trembles, then acts cleanly. The final choice doesn't foreclose a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt over Hargrove's execution is embodied through the ticking heart in his pocket, and his final decision to prove innocence shows agency with visible cost. However, the three-month backstory block consumes significant narrative real estate without anchoring sufficiently in present micro-choices. Interior conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Kael functions primarily as a sounding board rather than applying direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his compulsive work on the bell, with interiority anchored in concrete action ("the lie tasted like copper"). However, the backstory about his parents' deaths reads as inserted exposition rather than lived memory shaping a present choice, and the final smile lacks the contradictory impulse that would elevate the moment. Veyra remains functional but one-note, applying pressure without her own stake or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's motivation to chase deleted files is clear and rooted in personal disillusionment, but her internal landscape remains largely cerebral—"brightly attentive" reads as label rather than embodied contradiction. The archive work gives her investigative texture, yet key emotional beats (discovering the video, choosing to copy it) lack the contradictory impulse that would show genuine struggle. The lie about the patch is mentioned but never complicates a present choice with visible cost. Elias exists only in summary; no on-page relationship pressures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's "shadow-laced peacekeeper" role and "calmly intuitive" trait remain label-only; no internal contradiction or embodied struggle emerges under pressure. The final act—hurling the fragment—lacks visible cost or prior setup showing why this particular choice forecloses a path. Motivation ("map empathy onto action") is told in one line but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. The child's reflection and the seer's dying words are pure exposition devices rather than pressure applied by a second character on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior state is established—"skin felt thinner, thoughts slower"—and the lace parasol tip functions as a concrete anchor. His shift from tourist to volunteer shows movement, though the transformation feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The dying man's moment is embodied and specific, but Elias's own emotional arc lacks sufficient internal friction; his acceptance of the helper role arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior is embodied through concrete detail (rough hands, burned letter edge traced), and her final choice to reach for Elias carries visible cost in confronting past hurt. However, Elias's sudden appearance and immediate articulation of insight ("love isn't about fitting perfectly—it's about choosing to grow together") reads as convenient epiphany rather than earned struggle. The grandmother's voice metaphor and the closing "nurturing intersubjective understanding" veer toward therapy-speak that flattens peak beats. Internal contradiction is present but muted by the tidy emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker's "strangely honest" trait is stated but never tested under pressure—no moment where truth-telling costs him something on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("weight of unspoken knowledge," "echo of wisdom") rather than embodied perception. The prophet interaction bypasses dramatized resistance; the protagonist nods through confusion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path at closure; the thread-touch moment reads as receptive observation rather than a choice with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivations are clear and consistent throughout, but his interior life remains largely abstract and contemplative rather than contradictory under pressure. The piece offers "perceptively calm" and "quiet satisfaction" as traits, yet no genuine internal conflict tests these qualities—he never faces a moment where lingering might cost him something immediate. The final realization ("he had forgotten to live his own story") arrives as an epiphany rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (fingers brushing petals, the smile at the dove) but the work leans heavily on reflective summary rather than moment-by-moment choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is anchored in reverence and obsession, with embodied micro-choices (pressing the crystal to temple, whispering "Grow"). Internal contradiction appears briefly—silence as both refuge and now urgency to testify—but his motivation feels largely static contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final realization ("silence was not the absence of sound") arrives through reflection more than dramatized struggle. Agency at closure is present but tilts toward epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's precognitive forgetfulness is label-driven rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation to "capture the sound of growing older" remains abstract; we see him placing driftwood and receiving a tape, but internal conflict never acts simultaneously—he moves through beats without genuine struggle or visible cost to his choices. The woman functions as oracle rather than pressure, and the final step forward reads as acceptance without a hierarchy of competing values tested on the page. Interiority leans on poetic phrasing ("marrow of his bones," "silence between heartbeats") that asserts depth without dramatizing the specific cognitive friction his condition should create.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—to capture the ephemeral—is stated but never embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to restructure the camera using the clock hand feels sudden and unmotivated by prior struggle; the "revelation" arrives by metaphor ("sound of a leaf falling") rather than through dramatized pressure. The final choice to leave is reactive to external collapse, not a renunciation with visible internal cost. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("luminous ache," "weight of what he had seen") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows consistent interiority tied to his role as music therapist and friend, with the vinyl shard providing embodied memory. His "decisively kind" actions (setting guitar down, taking Lena's hand) track coherently through the scene. However, Lena's request to "hymn the mundane" feels slightly authorial rather than emerging from her established voice, and the final exchange lacks internal contradiction—Elias accepts each instruction smoothly without friction. The choice to reunify the vinyl pieces is presented cleanly but doesn't foreclose a competing path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to understand shadows is established, but her interior life relies on generic gestures ("fingers tightening," "breath fogged") and label-only emotional states. The final choice to "turn the key in the air" lacks the earned internal conflict or visible cost that would make it feel inevitable—she simply executes the guardian's instruction. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the progression reads more like puzzle-solving than character pressure. The "sealed awakening" backstory occupies significant space without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interior texture is established—forgiving skeptic who stays rather than flees—and her choice to return to the garden drives the action. The yearning and her bone-setting motivation are asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression reads more as declaration than embodied struggle. The changeling child's "smile too old for its face" leans on stock phrasing. Her final choice to take the child's hand feels inevitable but the internal cost or renunciation that forecloses another path is not made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her interiority is generally concrete, though some moments slip into soft epiphany ("she understood then"). The internal arc from reckless to reflective is signaled but not deeply contradictory in scene—she moves smoothly toward resolution without wrestling impulses on the page. Embodied emotion is present (cold biting through robes, heart lighter) but peaks lean toward summary ("memories were resurfacing like drowned things") rather than lived contradiction. The final choice feels more received than wrestled-for, capping the score below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's watchful observation of Mira is well-established through concrete micro-choices (carrying the notebook, noting her palm-press ritual), and his decision to show rather than judge creates the story's emotional turn. Mira's embodied tension ("shoulders tensed," "breath hitched") and the physical exchange of the pendant carry genuine cost. However, the final beat leans toward therapy-speak ("some wounds could be tended, some silences could be filled") that abstracts the earned emotional work. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; the siblings' competing impulses to protect and expose could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior is vividly established—conflicted, lucidly watchful, yearning—but his agency largely stays observational. The encounters with the woman, boy, and protagonist-ghost pass as visions rather than forcing micro-choices that visibly alter his tactics. The ending pivot ("let them pass through him") reads as epiphany rather than earned renunciation with on-page cost; we don't see what he forfeits by wading back. His embodied fear and attraction to the mist anchor him, but the closure lacks a credible choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's whimsical tinkerer identity is vividly established through specific props (clockwork beetles, glass prisms, silver flute), and her isolation is embodied in "the Dreamer Who Forgets to Eat." Interior access is clean and her choice to sing the old song arises from established motivation. However, the final-paragraph vision of villagers joining feels asserted rather than earned—no on-page friction tests her conviction that they will follow, and the tendril's agency (it "had sent her") borders on passivity, weakening her role in the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and embodied through slow, deliberate movements that show patience rather than tell it. His motivation—to seal the pause between heartbeats—is concrete and particular, though the final choice feels more meditative than dramatically earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The reflective block about "translating heartbeats into maps" operates at ~25% of the text but anchors in present stimuli (the illustration plate, the arranged objects) and primes the origami-jar action. Minor penalty for the lack of visible internal conflict during the climactic beat; the act unfolds without a felt cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to store wonder") is established but remains abstract throughout; his "peripherally focused" trait is asserted rather than shown constraining choices. The recognition scene with his younger self delivers a realized moment, but the shift from "storing wonder" to "letting it go" arrives as epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses dramatized in action. Interiority leans heavily on poetic summary ("the harvest of echoes," "liquid gold") without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interior motivation is coherent—she seeks to understand burdens rather than carry them—but the transformation at closure feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices. The burdens are described as weights she lets settle against her, yet there's no visible struggle or trade-off; they simply "dissolve back into the hush" without dramatized cost. Embodied emotion is present ("cold seeped into her skin") but flattens into poetic catalog rather than building contradictory impulses. The final lightness lacks a clear path of renunciation or choice that would ground the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior life is concrete and embodied—the rough texture of wood, the weight of contained space. Her grief manifests through contradictory impulses (letting the kettle build vs. pouring tea, hesitant carving vs. decisive strokes) that act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to set down the carving and accept the loft's "rust-hued peace" is earned by the prior causality of her three-year arc and the on-page carving process, though the cost feels more emotional resolution than foreclosure. Minor weakness: the "trying to harvest lessons from loss" realization edges toward abstraction rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scavenger's interiority is concrete and textured—"regret clung to her like the damp mist"—but the ghost encounter flattens into abstraction ("you took too long") without visceral contradiction or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final turn toward listening feels asserted rather than earned by prior on-page struggle; we see her collect fragments but never witness a choice between competing wants that would make the shift decisive. Embodied emotion is present early but dissolves into metaphor at closure, and the ghost's dialogue reads more like thematic echo than character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her professional lens shapes perception ("calculating load-bearing points"), but the final choice to sketch the greenhouse feels more like documentation than a decision with visible cost. The woman's years-long endurance has weight, yet her sudden appearance and immediate recognition read as convenience. The "functionally creative" label is asserted but never dramatized through a micro-choice that tests competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is anchored in concrete sensory detail (oil, parchment) and his avoidance patterns show consistent interior logic. The girl's trembling hands and the "excruciatingly gentle" memory create embodied emotion. However, the final turn—Elias following the bear and kneeling at the forecourt—feels unmotivated by prior internal contradiction; he shifts from avoidance to pursuit without on-page struggle. The closure choice lacks visible cost or a dramatized micro-decision that makes the shift earned.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The legend seeker's motivation is established through reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("the weight of something unspoken," "trained his instincts to parse the gaps") that remains at a conceptual distance. The mirror confrontation offers a moment of recognition, but the final choice—lifting the mirror—arrives without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Backstory about "years chasing whispers" anchors present stance minimally; the micro-choices (boarding, prying the crate) feel inevitable rather than pressured by contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—to preserve ancient methods—but his interior life lacks contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The "infinitely patient" touch and smile at the end read as labels rather than dramatized tension. The philosophical seed collector premise is told more than shown through choice; his decoding work proceeds without visible struggle or competing impulses. No secondary character appears to test his stance, leaving the characterization competent but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority shows purposeful contradiction—she writes obituaries for the living yet feels hollowed out by the act—and her micro-choices (kneeling to press the thread into soil, closing her eyes to imagine roots) reveal character under pressure. The king's physicians and the court's polished veneer supply secondary pressure, though these remain told rather than dramatized. Embodied emotion is present in "the garden's shadows clung to her like old grief," but some interiority slides toward label-only abstraction ("the geography of healing"). The final choice to "keep writing, keep weaving, keep projecting" reads as endurance with cost, though the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through trembling hands and weeping, but his internal arc follows a predictable realization path: machines fail, memory succeeds. The shift from contraption to song is telegraphed rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance reads as epiphany delivered rather than discovered through concrete struggle, though the cost of years spent on a failed approach registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's past-as-firefighter motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("grafted her past," "scars could sing") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The encounter with the girl shows surface gentleness but no genuine internal friction—no competing wants that force a visible cost. Backstory dominates without tilting present stance through micro-choices; the reflection is anchored to the coin and sand but does not alter her options on the page. The final choice to teach the girl feels declared rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority carries specificity ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but these traits function more as labels than lived contradictions driving micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother apparition delivers wisdom that feels convenient rather than earned through Elara's prior struggle. The final descent lacks embodied hesitation or cost—she simply steps forward after a breath. Internal conflict is gestured at ("too afraid to ask") but never dramatized as competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's sentimentalist trait and motivation are established early, but his interiority leans toward abstract reflection ("watched empires rise and fall") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice to activate the gear reads as predetermined rather than forced by competing wants. Kael's late arrival introduces potential conflict, but his capitulation ("only wonder") arrives without visible cost or prior friction that would make the shift feel earned. The generational pattern is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established early (honoring the dead, seeking connection with his father) and his actions align with those drives. The interiority shows genuine emotional specificity in moments like tracing his father's handwriting, but the final shift—from isolation to feeling "not alone"—arrives without visible internal contradiction or a difficult trade-off. The piece leans on reverent description rather than embodied struggle; Elias observes and receives more than he chooses under pressure, which limits agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to restore balance is established through forty years of winding, and the pendulum's hesitation creates pressure. The rake-handle confession mechanism shows embodied guilt, though the inscriptions feel discovered rather than earned through present choice. The final transfer of names to the bob demonstrates agency, but the arc from guilt to absolution lacks sufficient internal contradiction or cost—he simply performs the ritual and is unburdened. The piece needed Elias to resist or fail partway through the transfer to earn the release.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His actions—humming, organizing, planting roses—remain blithe and consistent without internal friction or cost. The ending gesture (planting roses around Margaret's niche) reads as continuation rather than transformation, and no visible path is foreclosed. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("velveteen gloom," "quiet persistence of roots") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The piece tells us she "had always admired" paradoxes and that she "understood its rhythms," yet we see no embodied contradiction or struggle in her choices. The act of writing unfolds without meaningful internal conflict—she hesitates once, then moves "faster," absorbed but never torn. The ending declares she "smiled" without dramatizing the cost of what she has wagered or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "teach the dust to tell stories" drives the narrative but remains largely declarative rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The transformation moment (dust glowing, word forming) arrives without sufficient internal resistance or visible trade-off—he simply hums and succeeds. The interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "smiled") and the final choice feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we see label-only determination rather than a character wrestling with cost. Backstory dominates without anchoring micro-choices that alter present options until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through physical gestures (pressing palm to chair, picking up mask), but the final revelation—his own face in the portrait—lacks sufficient causal grounding in his prior choices. The mask-wearing vision provides one concrete moment of internal contradiction (his mother's laughter with wet eyes), but the protagonist's agency remains mostly observational until the final scattering gesture. The "outrunning emotion" insight arrives as realization rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to expose historical truth is clear and his rationally rebellious trait manifests in concrete choices (living in the sewer, hoarding relics, deciding to take findings to dockworkers). Internal contradiction appears lightly—his isolation versus his need to be heard—but the final decision feels somewhat linear rather than torn. The character reads as consistent but lacks the embodied emotional complexity and simultaneous competing impulses that would push this higher; his agonizing is told more than shown in moment-to-moment micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miss Voss demonstrates clear interiority through her concrete observations of choir divisions and her strategic use of the zither, with embodied perception ("her throat tight"). The secondary cast—Maren, Liora, Mr. Harkin—are sketched with functional traits (sharp-tongued, warm voice, rumbling anchor) but remain somewhat stock, and the protagonist's shift from "not to teach, but to learn" to "teach them to listen" reads more as thematic claim than dramatized contradiction. Maren's hand-brushing moment at the end gestures toward earned change, but the transformation from scoffing to nudging feels compressed rather than causally built beat-by-beat. The resolution lacks visible cost on the page—hope is not a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's gift (tasting memories in food) is established but never constrains a choice—she tends the plant with generic "care" and "whispers words she didn't fully understand," which reads as passivity draped in mysticism. The fruit-eating vision delivers an emotional payoff (reunion with her mother) but the choice to bite is uncontested, and the prior "months pruning" are summarized without on-page struggle or contradiction. Interiority leans on label-speak ("her gift had always been a curse," "quiet understanding," "informally wise") rather than embodied perception under pressure, and the final stance—placing seeds in a pouch with "quiet certainty"—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness is established but never constrains a meaningful choice on the page—he simply says "Just a box" and the words "tasted like ash," a purely internal note. His motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" remains abstract until the final beat and doesn't drive contradictory impulses during the tower infiltration. Maren is competent but flat; her design role and the sabotage discovery don't create visible internal conflict or a hierarchy of values under pressure. The closure choice (striking the match) feels more like executing Maren's instruction than Elias reconciling competing desires with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior establishes a perceptual signature ("cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling") and the final choice—walking away—is earned by his realization that houses listen to themselves. However, the micro-choices are observation-heavy rather than crucible moments; he places the shard and steps back, but no visible cost or internal contradiction drives that act. Embodied emotion remains sparse, and the ending renunciation feels more like thoughtful departure than a foreclosed path with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The diver's interiority shows embodied tension—fingers tightening, breath hitching—and her motivation arc (certainty → nuance) drives the ending choice. However, her internal contradiction remains understated; we see hesitation but little visceral wrestling between competing impulses in the peak beat. The statue's telepathic voice is distinct and purposeful, though its serene indifference never costs it anything on the page, rendering it more oracle than agent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through telling ("grim optimist," "hope like a bruise," "balancedly daring") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. His interior life relies on abstract philosophical musings about infinity and cycles without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion at the key turn. The dice-rolling moment lacks genuine conflict—no weighing of cost, no hesitation, just execution of a plan. The final climb registers as acceptance without visible renunciation or altered stance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical details (trembling fingers, smudged ink), but her motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. The three-night insomnia and the dream-faces are told with specificity, yet no internal contradiction emerges—she moves smoothly from fatigue to certainty without struggle. The final choice (leaving paintings for strangers) arrives without visible cost or friction; no live alternative is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to rescue dying arts is present and her embodied actions (kneading dough, holding the opera glass) show engagement, but her interior contradictions remain shallow. The dream sequence feels inserted rather than earned through prior pressure, and the climactic baking moment lacks genuine struggle—she simply kneads and succeeds. The baker's presence adds some relational pressure, but their exchange is brief and the emotional stakes never truly conflict. The final choice (baking the bread) doesn't foreclose a meaningful path with visible cost; it's a straightforward fulfillment rather than a wrenching trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "step beyond fate's design" is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. His actions follow logically—tracing the stone, examining the yoyo, dropping it—but interiority remains abstract ("heart hammering," "bleak and exhilarated") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final smile and winding gesture hint at transformation, yet no visible cost forecloses a prior path; the change reads conceptual rather than felt. Agency is present but the stakes feel more asserted than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is motivated by post-resuscitation dread of hollowness, but interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("unbosomed his deepest dread") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn at the mirror—reaching out to starve fear—lands with some agency, yet the advisor's aphoristic guidance does most of the conceptual work. Emotional progression from terror to relief reads schematic; the final smile and lighter chest feel mechanically resolved without sustained internal friction. No secondary character applies on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward's motivation to transform obstacles is clear, and his embodied connection to the sea ("soles of his feet," "salt in his veins") grounds interiority. However, the internal arc flatlines after the midpoint: he faces no genuine friction or contradictory impulse, and the final laugh arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece defaults to competence without struggle—he simply executes his vision—which undercuts the earned-change requirement for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's curiosity and drive are established early through concrete action (mapping cracks, using the chisel), and her final choice to flee and then board the ship demonstrates agency under pressure. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract pattern-language whispers rather than embodied contradiction, and the expedition's hollow-eyed transformation feels more atmospheric than psychologically earned. The decision to run and then immediately pivot to seeking more cracks lacks visible internal conflict—no felt cost between competing impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and the internal conflict between exposing versus preserving the forgery operates throughout. The decision to let both truth and lie stand feels earned by his historian's dilemma. However, Liora's sudden appearance and her immediate understanding ("You're not stealing it... You're preserving it") resolves tension too smoothly without sufficient on-page friction. The "emotionally rational" label appears but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias functions primarily as observer and note-responder rather than agent under pressure. His "stoically sensitive nature" is labeled but not dramatized through contradictory impulses; the notes prompt reflection but no visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final choice—writing responses—feels more ritual than wrestle, lacking the embodied hesitation or trade-off that would charge the renunciation or endurance. The shift from "surveyor" to "keeper of echoes" is asserted rather than earned through on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to trace the stamp's origin is clear and drives his choices throughout. The discovery of his family connection feels somewhat convenient—the ledger appears exactly when needed, and the emotional weight of "Veyne" doesn't sufficiently alter his stance or force a difficult choice. His "tranquilly perceptive" movement through the library remains consistent, but interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the weight of centuries settling on his shoulders") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    Veyra's interiority is present but overly poetic and abstract; her grief over her brother is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final moment ("the world *transformed*") gestures at change but the cost and agency remain vague—what choice did she make, what path did she foreclose? Motivation is stated (folding grief, seeking dreams) but never tested against a competing want or fear that would create genuine pressure. The priests and brother exist only as background exposition, not as forces that complicate her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to hunt is rooted in grief over her destroyed wedding, and her actions—crouching, moving through the observatory, confronting the ghost—are consistent with her drive to find answers. Interior glimpses ("Fear was a luxury she had burned away") hint at her transformation, but much of her psychology is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to run feels reactive rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization that forecloses a path with visible cost. The scientist-ghost appears too briefly to test her values or force a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is visible—he's chasing signals—but his interior life remains thin; we see him hesitate and nod but not the contradictory impulses that would make the choice costly. The pilgrim is characterized almost entirely by her perpetual surprise, which functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. The final decision to follow the call lacks visible forfeiture; we don't see what Elias is leaving behind or what competing need he's sacrificing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his profession of falsifying bloodlines shapes his guilt in character-specific ways. His micro-choices—tracing the watch, prying off the broken hand—embody contradictory impulses (memorializing his mother's death versus releasing it). The uncle's late arrival introduces exposition that feels convenient rather than earned through prior dramatization, and the shift from passive investigation to sudden confrontation lacks sufficient internal resistance. The final gesture of snapping the hour hand reads as tidy catharsis rather than a move constrained by prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows embodied motivation through the drawer pull talisman and interior debate about untethering, but his characterization leans abstract—wisdom-recycling and father-house metaphors dominate where specific contradictory impulses in the moment would sharpen. Seris is largely label-functional ("uncommonly thoughtful" told more than shown). The final turn feels contemplative rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; Elias steps back but we don't see what he's renounced or gained in that retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his renunciation arc reads earned, with the compass hurling dramatizing the cost of letting go. The reflection on his father's expectations is anchored in present stimuli (vest straps, compass weight) and tilts present stance. However, the emotional progression follows a somewhat tidy path from regret to relief without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in key beats—he moves cleanly from burden to release. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost (throwing the compass), but the internal warring between heart and action could be sharper in the middle turns.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's neural reset premise and fragments of his past create interior contradiction, but the character work remains largely told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The moment kneeling in the dark—"the moment he'd lost his empathy"—reads as diagnostic summary rather than dramatized breaking point. The final beat ("here to remember why he'd tried to forget") gestures toward a stance shift but doesn't foreclose a path with visible cost; we see no choice that alters his options on the page. Mara's presence adds texture but applies minimal immediate pressure relevant to Elias's central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior contains some embodied emotion ("her hands trembled," "throat tightened"), but key moments default to stock phrasing and therapy-speak: "paradoxically steady—calm in the face of chaos" reads diagnostic rather than dramatized. The motivation to resurrect her beloved is legible and drives her conjuring ritual, yet the transformation itself becomes more spectacle than felt choice—she "simply held on" without internal contradiction or trade-off at the peak. The "reluctant metamorphosis" framing positions his transformation as painful, but Liora's stance shift from loss to acceptance arrives too smoothly; no micro-choices reveal competing impulses in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation is established ("to find where lost time accumulates") and her actions are consistent, but interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The reflection on her mother's hands and the past handprint does anchor present action (tracing with ink), but the piece relies on atmospheric assertion ("willingly perplexed," "confusion itself were a kind of devotion") more than dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final choice to let her hands rest feels more like Earned Stasis than a decision forged through visible internal conflict, and the cost—while present—is told through lyric summary rather than a visceral forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's pacifism is stated but never tested by an on-page choice involving violence or mercy. Her emotional progression from morning happiness to closure smile reads smooth without contradiction or embodied cost. The stitching action shows method but not internal conflict—she never wavers, never doubts, never pays a visible psychological price for becoming "the wound." The final lightness feels asserted rather than earned through prior suffering dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's philanthropic compulsion is established early and drives his presence on the beach, but his internal contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatized in scene. The woman's hollow-eyed recognition feels externally imposed rather than emerging from prior character work. The final sprint to save the village reads as fulfillment of prophecy rather than earned character choice—his agency is reactive, not internally conflicted. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is abstract ("heart still carried the weight").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear—she wants the letters to spark a revolution—but her interior life reads more as competence display than genuine internal conflict. The "calmly inventive" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to light the torch and leave feels mechanically executed rather than earned through visible psychological cost; we see capability but not struggle or genuine foreclosure of alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior is richly textured with sensory detail and the weight of familial obligation, but his interiority relies heavily on metaphor and summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to complete the sequence feels more like fulfilling an inherited script than a choice forged under competing pressures. The final moment registers as resolution but lacks visible internal cost or foreclosed paths—he exhales relief rather than enduring a trade-off. Motivation is consistent but not tested by genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical register ("rarefied his anger," "cartography of scars") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. The photograph triggers contemplation but no embodied micro-choices that test competing impulses; he arrives to understand and leaves having understood, with the key shift ("some maps were never meant to be read, only carried") declared rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost. Emotional states are labeled ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") more than dramatized through perception and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The mechanical arm is mentioned but never constrains a choice or shapes agency; Elias's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" remains an abstract claim rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The "diplomatically fierce" reputation is label-only backstory. Isolde exists primarily to receive exposition; her challenge to a "duel of wits" never lands as embodied pressure—no contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final "surrender" exhale arrives without visible cost or prior struggle that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lumen's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied moments like "fingers tracing the coffee tin" and the molting personality detail creating internal contradiction. However, the final decision to rebuild feels insufficiently tested—Elias's arrival provides external permission rather than forcing Lumen to reconcile his fractured identity through a difficult choice. The renunciation of molting is declared ("he didn't feel like molting") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Motivation tracks consistently but the transformation lacks the friction needed for full credibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—using music to break from grief—and his "strategically creative" trait manifests in the concrete plan to play an unplanned encore. Internal contradiction appears (wound the clock "not to keep time, but to remember"), and the final choice to launch into wild music feels earned by seventeen years of routine. However, the wife's departure and the film-reel discovery remain largely told rather than tested under present pressure, and the travelers function as witnesses rather than applying relational crucible. The ending choice carries visible cost (throwing himself off a cliff, trusting the wind), but the progression leans more on backstory weight than on-page micro-choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interiority relies on abstract concepts ("fragile tapestry of belief," "memories dissolving") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The final choice to plant the seed lacks visible internal conflict or friction; she simply does it after the dream, and the revelation follows without her wrestling with cost. Nani appears as a dispenser of wisdom rather than applying direct pressure. The ending gesture—"she would tell them. Not all of it"—reads as convenient calibration rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior world is established through concrete action (tracing the maple, kneeling at the compass), and his motivation coheres around regret and severance. However, the climactic choice—mending by weaving a lace thread into the bonsai—feels more symbolic than grounded in embodied struggle or contradictory impulse. The "cerulean regret" and "color of unspoken apologies" remain abstracted labels rather than dramatized states that constrain his choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is present but diluted by poetic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is precise and embodied, with her neutron-star background providing a resonant contrast to her present humility. Contradictory impulses (drama vs. quiet accumulation) act simultaneously in scene, and her final renunciation of "drama" for patient observation is earned by the causal chain of her examination. The cost—foreclosing her previous professional identity—is felt in the final image of her sketching dust.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular (glass artist's perception, adaptive resilience), with embodied emotion (scars, cold water touch). Her motivation to understand the fire intensifies to a higher-stakes choice upon learning the canyon's threat. The final charged poise—folding the ledger—is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values. Minor deduction because contradictory impulses under pressure are present but not deeply dramatized in the confrontation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, rooted in trauma and desperate need; interiority is embodied and specific. His final choice (striking the fork) is earned by weeks of practice and carries the cost of irreversible hearing loss. The relationship with Liora applies pressure but remains secondary; his internal struggle between despair and persistence drives the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is deep with embodied interiority; the undertaker's stubbornness and weariness drive credible choices; final steadiness earned through prior causality with visible cost in his journey.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and her persistence is shown through deliberate micro-choices, but the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents a higher score under the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lien's interiority is concrete and her motivation—to find where unused love is stored—drives the climax organically. The final choice to give Kwan Yin's tear is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her realization. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are embodied in the "weight in her chest."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (letting the past rest) is earned by prior causality, though some backstory is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's concrete interiority and embodied stress (raw wrists, clinking chains) ground her evolution from captive to participant. Vey remains slightly opaque, but his strategic patience is demonstrated through on-page decoding and choice to deter rather than fight. The final decision to "take what you can carry" is an earned micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values (planting over hoarding) with visible cost (leaving the vault as the wall falls).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma and impending death. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions (once thought madness, now understands) acting simultaneously. Final choice (imprinting the silence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost of cancer and betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira's contradictory impulses (thief vs. curator) are embodied under pressure; her final choice to forgo the train is earned by the causal interaction with Kael, with visible cost in the missed departure. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory (cracked but functional, frozen but thawing), and his final choice to embrace the thaw is earned by prior causality with visible cost—letting go of winter’s shield. The micro-choices (adjusting the bookmark, flipping switches) reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied. Hairline slip: the epiphany moment (“maybe the cracks were where the light got in”) leans slightly overt, but remains character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s characterization is concrete, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (“pressing the seashell half into his palm,” “tremor in her hands”). Her adaptability and motivation from the betrayal drive credible choices, and the final stance (“Then let’s start over”) is earned. A slight tell (“firmly adaptive”) is offset by demonstrated action, and the caretaker’s fleeting recognition adds secondary pressure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Oracle's obsession and final renunciation are earned through concrete actions; interiority is embodied in tactile details like tracing pebbles and the booklet's dust. The quiet transformation from seeker to one who "did not feel the need to speak" carries visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies under pressure of the dimming star.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    E-7X's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete, machine-specific interiority. His choice to engage the violin and endure loops reveals a hierarchy of values. The final charged poise—gaining direction, not answer—is earned by prior causality, with cost in the acceptance of pursuit over resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory impulses (Mira's guardedness vs. desire for connection) act in scene; final choice to be honest is earned by prior causality with visible cost of years of mistrust. Characterization is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's interior contradiction (pretending not to care vs. longing for acknowledgment) is embodied in micro-choices like polishing marbles and clipping the rose. His final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the withered garden and his aged hands.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove her theory is clear and drives all key choices; interiority is concrete via embodied emotion (trembling hands, heart pounding) and micro-choices under pressure (overriding protocols, syncing frequency). The final realization carries cost, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.

Her transformation is earned via gradual, concrete bodily changes (moss-stained hands, vine-tangled hair) and a credible endurance of her obsession. Interiority is specific and avoids stock phrasing. The final stance (Earned Stasis as a figure of folklore) carries a felt cost of social distance. A slight deduction for the dream sequence functioning as a slightly convenient catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation as a tinkerer chasing precision is clear and intensifies under pressure, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion under stress are somewhat abstract; the final realization is thematically consistent but lacks deep internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, but the line “To understand the weight of names—that had been her motivation all along…” introduces a moment of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undercuts the embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Collector's burden and quiet rebellion are concretely embodied; interior contradictions (fear/fearlessness) act in scene; final gift is earned by engagement, with cost felt in the woman's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "phantom pain that mirrored the interrogations"). The final insight is earned by his choice to drink the vial, showing contradictory impulses in his hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong characterization with clear motivation rooted in traits; interiority is concrete and emotions embodied in micro-choices like twitching toward the fragment. Final commitment to searching is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s skillfully observant trait is concretely embodied in action (tracing dust patterns, noticing the fracture) and drives her choice to engage the crack, earning a final Charged Poise. Her endurance (“ghosts didn’t care about union hours”) and the cost of her vigilance are felt. A slight deduction for internal contradiction under peak stress being more summarized than dramatized in the moment of pressing the barrel.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation as a letterpress operator compressing eternity is clear and drives his decisive action; interiority is concrete through tactile interactions (tracing spines, reading frost). However, emotional states are occasionally abstractly stated ("He knew what it meant"), and the final choice, while earned, lacks a visible internal struggle beyond professional understanding. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is rooted in concrete backstory (the shard as relic of a failed revolution) and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final ritual. Interiority is specific and embodied ("burnished sorrow in his chest aching like an old wound"). His final choice—using the shard and mirrors—is a credible renunciation/endurance that forecloses the path of compromise with visible cost (he is slumped, breath shallow). Dr. Vex applies immediate secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interior conflict is embodied and evolves under pressure, with micro-choices (trembling, reaching) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final decision to slot the chip is earned by prior causality—the chip's pull, the stranger's catalyst, and the painful memory of his father. The stranger is archetypal but functional; no flaw touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear, rooted in curiosity and connection to his grandfather, but lack contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to collect the mist is earned by prior causality, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally personal, limiting emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation as a "perpetually learning" sculptor is clear and consistent, embodied in his immediate acceptance of the supernatural and his decisive carving. However, internal conflict is minimal; his transition into the timewoven alliance lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle, slightly reducing depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and driven by a consistent obsession; her micro-choices (going to the cathedral, spreading postcards) reveal her search, and the final renunciation of needing answers is earned by the accumulated imagery. No second character on page, so focus on interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The quiet endurance feels credible with a visible cost in the final mural addition.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority ("fingers trembled," "stomach twisted"). Her final choice to flee with the ledgers is earned, though the climactic escape relies slightly on external rescue (Rourke's zeppelin), slightly diminishing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is characterized through concrete micro-choices (his experiments, stubborn endurance) and a clear, consistent motivation rooted in rejecting false comfort. His final hopeful stance is earned by the preceding struggle. The lack of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but his interior contradiction (stubborn vs. yearning) is well-drawn. A minor deduction for the epiphanic "he *knew*" moment feeling slightly declarative rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is rendered with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; his micro-choices under pressure (reciting languages, pressing the pomegranate) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance shift—from archiver to listener—is earned by the accumulative texture of the scene, with cost legible in the stained fingers and the smile of a new beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is concrete and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to carry the past forward is earned by prior causality with visible cost (warm acorn cap). Interiority is embodied without stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora's embodied curiosity and micro-choices under pressure create a compelling arc; the final, costly decision to ring the bell is earned by prior causality and a visible near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied; his shift from janitor to witness is earned through specific micro-choices (grabbing the glass, tracing the star). However, contradictory impulses do not act simultaneously in scene, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's silent endurance and perceptive nature are concrete; final choice to open the box is earned by ghostly pressure, with cost in changed silence, though internal contradiction is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and consistent, with Elias's motivation clear and his final choice to embed messages an earned, character-driven shift. However, interior conflict is more summarized than embodied in scene; his realization that "the time capsule wasn't a thing—it was a person" is an intellectual epiphany lacking the contradictory, simultaneous impulses of a high-band beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's interiority is embodied and consistent; her shift from grief to harmonizing is earned through concrete micro-choices. The healing thought is slightly diagnostic but remains in character for a poet, with no major flaws touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as caretaker and his impending death. His interiority is concrete (tracing grooves, feeling the pulse) and his "brazen calm" under pressure is embodied. However, the characterization lacks a significant on-page internal contradiction or struggle; his resolve is steady, missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate to 9+. His final endurance (Earned Stasis) is credible and costs him his remaining time.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—skepticism warring with the evidence—is concretely embodied in his handling of the amber and his concessionary steps. His final change is earned by the causal progression of the scene and Liora’s demonstration, with the cost legible as the dissolution of his "second skin" of doubt. However, his emotional progression is slightly tidy, moving from scoffing to belief without deeper contradictory impulses mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his motivation to "fertilize the idea of return" drives micro-choices like scattering seeds, culminating in Earned Stasis with cost in "his heart was not lighter." Contradictory impulses (hope vs. realism) are subtle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and embodied, with Elias's trauma ("hands began to shake," "maps of the dead") motivating his stasis and eventual choice. His final decision to walk into the dark is a credible, earned endurance (Earned Stasis) foreclosing his path of escape, scaled to the length. The leaf object effectively externalizes his internal conflict. Minor deduction for a touch of summary in his motivation statement ("to translate that distance into closeness").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied interiority, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lirien’s motivation—wonder over greed—is clear and drives her risky trade. Her final realization ("not an object, but a question") is an earned conceptual shift rooted in prior causality (the guardian's cryptic warning). However, a slight diagnostic note enters her peak beat: "Lirien realized then..." introduces a mild label-speak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora's crisis actor backstory and desire to unbind create a clear, contradictory interiority. Her final choice to "be the historian" is a credible renunciation earned by the encounter. The man's "benevolently ruthless" nature applies pressure but his interiority is secondary; her micro-choices under his gaze (kneeling, asking "Then teach me") reveal a shift in values.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to "understand the shape of home" is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority ("mercury in his veins") and embodied emotion. Micro-choices like pressing the feather to his wrist reveal values, and his final realization is earned by prior causality. The old woman applies brief secondary pressure, but her minimal presence doesn't hinder the single-POV depth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through fidgeting and decoding; interior contradiction between changing past and accepting forgiveness is dramatized; final renunciation of fidgeting earned by causal sequence with visible cost in the exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's defiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices (tracing the spire, engaging with Echo, speaking poetry). Her internal conflict between ritual preparation and breaking the hush is dramatized, and her final realization—that forgiveness requires courage to speak—is earned by the causal chain of her poetic acts. The cost of facing the echoes is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's quiet determination and Maren's skepticism create credible pressure. Interiority is concrete through sensory vibrations, and the final experiment is earned by prior causality. Minor lack of internal contradiction, but micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with interiority shown through tactile interactions with the censer and environment. The final choice to continue walking is earned by the causal chain of calls and the censer's guidance, with cost legible in the vastness he navigates. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly enacted in scene, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's characterization is concrete; internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure earn the final renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his shift from duty to hope is earned through specific micro-choices (following ants, bringing the chip). The final charged poise is motivated by prior causality, though the hesitation beat is slightly swift, preventing a perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Queen's interiority and motivation are clear and embodied; micro-choices under pressure lead to an earned transformation. Mirror queen is more a device than a character, but that's acceptable in this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's motivation to capture presence is concrete and drives her micro-choices, and her final decision to share rather than capture is earned by the prior causality of Elias's return and her internal conflict. The cost of time is felt, and the relationship crucible forces a reconfiguration. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("she had expected anger, or at least suspicion") is present but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("jealousy was a living thing, coiling in his gut"), and his endurance at the door is a credible stance crystallization. Motivation is clear, rooted in his profession and personal dread, compelling higher-stakes choices under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion (tracing grooves "as if reading braille") and a micro-choice (etching the screw) that reveals hierarchy of values. His backstory as an aromatherapist who lost smell anchors his present stance and earns the final change: he no longer feels missing something. Clara's still hands and trembling voice offer a distinct, pressurized relationship. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her internal conflict between scholarly dismissal and superstitious need driving the narrative. Her final choice to let the ink crystallize is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values (transforming pain over perfection) with visible cost. The contradictory impulses of grief and hope act simultaneously in the scene, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses her path of silence. The only minor hairline slip is a slight tendency toward abstract emotional labels ("grief had solidified into silence"), but this is quickly grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's guilt, profession, and metaphorical worldview are concretely embodied; his micro-choices under pressure (uncorking the bottle, performing the ritual) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final lighter but weary endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the cracked bottle and the falling orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The final choice to press the dictionary to the stone is earned by the unraveling universe, though the character remains somewhat archetypal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is characterized through concrete, professional micro-choices (adjusting the eyepiece, squinting at gears) that reveal a mind grappling with a metaphysical problem under pressure. His final understanding—that clocks measure resistance—is earned by the sequence of failed attempts and the visceral cost of his blood. Internal contradiction is shown in his disciplined counting (calm) against the rising peculiarity (alarm). The only minor slip is the epiphany's conceptual leap, though it's anchored in the preceding physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his expertise, with interiority shown through precise actions like using the laser pointer. His final choice to "let go" is earned by prior causality and the revelation from Mara, though the emotional cost is slightly subtle. Contradictory impulses are present but not deeply explored, keeping it from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and motive-driven; her probability-flavored interiority and the "clover melancholy" moment are slightly abstract but not diagnostic. The final choice to "burn the numbers" is earned by prior causality (the clues, the lantern, her father's notes) and forecloses a path with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure (tracing the ink, using the matchbook) reveal her values.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with a clear motivation of cultivated estrangement. Her micro-choices (listening, not correcting) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The final doubt ("wondered if she had done enough") introduces a subtle internal conflict, but the characterization remains slightly static, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his motivation to preserve then release Liora's memory is clear and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to drop the locket feels earned by prior causality with visible cost ("The locket slipped from his fingers..."). Minor deduction for the slightly ornamental "walnut-ink archivist" label, though it integrates thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s loneliness is concretely embodied through his desperately jocular shield and three-year search; his micro-choices under pressure (offering the moon rock) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final conceptual repricing—that loneliness is a debt paid forward—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his altered emotional state. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and her final realization is earned through embodied, sensory experience. Minor deduction for abstract phrasing nearing therapy-speak ("her fears unravel, her questions dissolve") in the peak beat, slightly blunting the concrete interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's fragile confidence and contingent reliance on Elias are concretely embodied, with contradictory impulses (desire to correct versus fear of worsening) driving her micro-choices. The final decision to edit history is earned through the dialogue's pressure, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s characterization is concrete and interior; contradictory impulses (“joyful sorrow”) act in scene, and her final endurance (“Keep going”) is earned by prior causality. Elias is a coherent secondary pressure. The “quietly charismatic” trait is told more than shown through costly choices, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is strong and consistent, with Elara's analytical drive and the Scribe's fevered purpose clarified through action and dialogue. The final choice to help is earned by her prior pursuit and the revealed truth. Minor deduction: "analytically intuitive mind" is a tell-y label, and "volcanic tenderness" edges toward abstract emotion, slightly reducing embodied specificity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation (find Liora) is clear, concrete, and escalates under pressure; his quietly rebellious trait is shown, not told, and informs his escape. Interiority is embodied (serum burning, fingers drumming). The final merging is a resonant reconfiguration earned by his prior choices, though the extremity of the transformation slightly outpaces the established cost of the serum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete and compelling; his motivation to prove the whispers drives the plot. The woman is slightly underdeveloped but does not harm closure. Final choice to give the key is earned by prior causality, though cost is more implied than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris's silent empathy is consistently embodied through micro-choices (mirror, pebble) and rooted in a clear motive. Interiority is shown via tactile perception, though internal contradiction is minimal; the final endurance is earned with visible cost in her solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's grief is embodied through ritualized micro-choices; his motivation to "cultivate lightness" is clear and drives the narrative. The final endurance (speaking to avoid silence) is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.5)
    Protagonist's aesthetic drive and "tremor of certainty" are embodied through concrete micro-choices (tracing quartz, kneeling, vocal writing).

No diagnostic labels; interiority is specific and sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's colorblindness and artistic struggle are concretely embodied; his micro-choices under pressure (hesitation, plant arrangement, acceptance of the glass shard) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

Liora's "innocently cunning" is shown in her grin and actions, though briefly told.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied; interior contradiction in questioning assumptions and micro-choices under pressure earn the final realization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's grief is concretely embodied through tactile interaction with tools and jewelry. His micro-choice to follow the origami trail demonstrates motivation rooted in longing. The final choice to apply the stencil is an Earned Stasis that forecloses pure mourning with visible cost. However, Liora's spectral appearance to deliver the thematic lesson feels slightly convening, reducing the agency of his internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s characterization is concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene; her final choice to reply is earned by established curiosity with visible cost ("stepping into the map"). Embodied detail (onyx-ink stains, frayed cuff) and micro-choices under pressure anchor a credible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation (anguished joy, pursuit of forbidden knowledge) is clear and embodied. Her micro-choices under pressure (following Kael, kneeling) and final renunciation are earned by the revelation of the archive's true nature, with visible cost in letting go. The child Kael serves as a poignant secondary pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is consistently drawn, with clear motivation rooted in his trait as a "dusk noticer."

His final choice—merging the footage—is a softly deliberate micro-choice that reveals his values and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his gentle nature and betrayed trust create contradictory impulses that culminate in an earned choice to trim the tail, with cost visible in his lost illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. His motivation to seek closure intensifies through the hourglass and plant telepathy, leading to an earned realization. Minor abstraction in his initial wound-keeping prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a crystal gazer; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. However, internal contradiction is minimal—her determination is steady, lacking contradictory impulses in scene—and the cost of the film blackening is light, though the final choice to reach for the pen is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's moonstruck dreamer trait is concretely embodied (trembling fingers, shallow breath) and her motivation to free trapped creativity drives the scene. The final release is earned by her prior struggle and the choice to let go, with visible cost in her exhaustion. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she is uniformly drawn to the cosmos, slightly limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's dreamless immunity and curiosity create a credible internal contradiction; his final stance shift to guarding sparks is earned by the archive encounter with visible cost in expanded responsibility. Micro-choices under pressure are specific, though agency remains slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The philosopher's motivation is clear and drives the story, but interior contradiction is minimal; his final choice is earned by prior events yet lacks deep internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her internal shift from passenger to active seeker is earned, though her characterization relies on summary past and lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene. Elias serves as a functional guide but his wisdom is more stated than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in nerve regeneration and embodied emotion, but interior contradictory impulses are more backstory than acted in scene, limiting the highest band. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final renunciation is earned with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies (scholar/thief, "weight of her purpose"). Interiority is concrete and embodied ("pressed upon her like the gravity of forgotten gods"). The final choice—taking the scroll with resolve—is an Earned Stasis of endurance, credible given her year-long search. A minor weakness: the "diminutive titan" descriptor, while vivid, is more asserted than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's curiosity and persistence are clear, motivating drivers; her embodied tic (tapping rhythms) and investigative micro-choices under pressure feel specific. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she is single-minded—and while her final commitment is credible, the visible, felt cost of that choice (beyond a quickened pulse and a smile) is somewhat muted, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's interiority is concrete and her motivation to find meaning is clear, driving her to touch the stone. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but internal contradiction in the peak moment is subtle, slightly limiting the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (rebellious, plant-connected, driven by curiosity and a need to choose). Interiority is concrete (gnarled fingers, static-like prickling, dreams) and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (defying the Council, the world's rebirth). Minor hairline slip: her "purpose" at the climax is stated a touch abstractly, but the embodied preceding beats anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses (disbelief vs. staying, freezing then looking) act in scene; her final choice to tend the cutting is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the buried photograph. Interiority is concrete and embodied, and her relationship with Mira functions as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concretely embodied through tremors, tarot-handling, and erasures; his motivation to face darkness intensifies credibly into redesigning his loss. Contradictory impulses act in scene via rhetorical questions and the act of erasing versus recreating. The final endurance—lying down as walls close, then drawing "the shape of the ache"—is earned by prior untangling and carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression remains specific and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong with consistent motivation and micro-choices under pressure; Elias's curiosity and wildness drive the plot. Some traits are told ("consciously wild") rather than fully shown, but his final resolve is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; the final choice to plant the letter is earned by prior causality and shows a visible cost—the risk of Order retaliation versus his fear of silence. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's characterization is precise and contradictory: a pacifist who reaches for a knife, a perceptive soul who "bent" her father's violent lessons. Her final choice—offering a rose, not fighting—is a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) earned by her established nature. The father's flicker of emotion is motivated by the specific, embodied gesture of the wilting rose in his calloused hand, showing a micro-choice that reconfigures their relationship without words.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael's cool-headedness is embodied through steady actions; his pursuit of the echo is motivated and yields an earned closure with visible cost in transformation, though internal contradiction is minimal.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's death, with interiority shown through the nib and her observational trait. Her shift from passive cataloguer to active intervener is earned. Some emotional beats ("hollow as the observatory’s echoing halls") verge on abstract but are anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's guilt is embodied and concrete, driving every micro-choice; his final act of tattooing is an earned renunciation that forecloses escape with visible cost (the burning ink, permanent ledger). The backstory is anchored to present stimuli (letters, cries) and tilts his stance. Minor deduction for a slightly summary backstory block, but the interior contradiction (silence vs. listening) acts in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied (stomach clench, trembling hands). Her final micro-choice (pressing the tile flake) is earned by prior causality and reveals a shift from forcing patterns to listening. Maren provides secondary pressure. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's retrocognitive trap and renaming practice create a compelling interior contradiction, and her final choice to redefine "Amira" is earned by her established values. Micro-choices (pressing the tessera, the blood) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in emotional embodiment (e.g., "heart a quiet furnace").

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's synesthesia and longing for Liora's encore are clear motivations; interiority is concrete with sensory details. The final choice to offer hope is earned by prior study of the garden's magic, with cost in the fragile timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's affectionate skepticism drives clear motivation and embodied interiority; change to acceptance earned through on-page choices. Eli functions as support but lacks depth, minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eira’s characterization is concrete and motivated, with embodied micro-choices (clutching the fossil, breath hitching) under pressure. Her final acceptance is earned by prior causality—the fossil's heat, the caves' whispers—and forecloses her old path with visible cost (device shattered, swallowed). Minor diagnostic phrasing ("her fear and awe tangled") in a peak beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and her quiet, patient curiosity is consistent, embodied in micro-choices like sorting buttons by "the faintest trace of wear." Her final act of turning the hourglass back is an Earned Stasis rooted in her established disbelief in prophecies and belief in "the weight of things." However, the emotional embodiment is slightly muted; her lack of reaction ("didn’t gasp... didn’t even smile") is character-consistent but borders on summary, slightly distancing the peak cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—leaving the pillbox—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (scars no longer aching). No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (mending) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis (serenity) is motivated by prior reflection and action, though the emotional progression is subtle and the cost of his endurance is felt more conceptually than viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ren's motivation is clear and rooted in his phototropic nature, compelling his choice to engage with the oasis. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through his tactile connection to clay and light. However, internal contradiction is absent; the character lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene, which limits the depth of his micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is strong, concrete, and earns its final gesture. Elias's internal state is embodied (dirt beneath nails, wiping hands) and his motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is dramatized through his gardening and the gift. His final choice—giving away the bitting gauge tooth—is a credible, values-driven micro-choice with visible cost (relinquishing a connection to his father). Lila applies immediate, relevant pressure. The only minor deduction is for a slight tendency toward thematic statement in Elias's reflection ("endings were just beginnings in disguise"), which edges toward earned wisdom but is anchored enough in the concrete rosebush image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's interiority is concretely embodied ("brittle, as if the weight of a thousand lives had settled into her bones overnight") and her micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the sundial, kneeling to the hum, reaching for the book) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The final choice to carry the past forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the years of isolation translated.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistently drives her choices; her interiority is concrete and embodied through actions like tracing the spiral and writing her own letter. The final choice (to stop looking for the pattern) feels earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in her relinquished search. However, the epiphany moment ("It was here all along") leans slightly toward telliness, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete (trembling fingers, fogged glass). The final choice to activate the signal is earned by prior causality, and the cautious hope at the end feels credible. Minor slip: explanation of tricksters borders on diagnostic label-speak but is anchored in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied emotion; claustrophobia is shown and later forgotten, marking a change. However, internal conflict is minimal during the key choice, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's face-blindness and methodical nature are concretely embodied and drive her micro-choices; her final renunciation (to awaken empathy through art) is earned by prior causality. The sister is functional but the single POV focuses effectively on Elara's internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling fingers, spongey dread). The final charged poise is earned by prior causality, though the shift from nervous confidence to dread is slightly abrupt but within bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation intensifies under pressure; the shift from chronicler to witness to leader is earned by prior beats. However, the final choice ("He knew what he had to do") leans slightly toward summary, costing a fraction of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Veyra’s guarded nature and contradictory impulses (duty vs. guilt) are embodied under pressure; the frozen confession and final confrontation are earned by the seed’s causal demand, with visible cost in the mirror and the grown child’s threat. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation clear, but the sudden appearance of the woman and their brief interaction limits the relationship as crucible. His final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weight of fear and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora's reckless idealism and fiercely gentle nature are embodied in concrete choices under pressure; the pivotal memory trade-off is earned by prior desperation and carries visible cost when she forgets her brother's voice and smile, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Jake’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (clinging to the past vs. openness to Lena) acting in scene. His final choice—listening to the future—is earned by prior causality, and the cost of vulnerability is visible when he hands Lena the cloth. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("Purpose wasn’t something you found...") is brief and not in a peak beat, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her scientific curiosity and methodical nature. Her micro-choices (tracing cuneiform, pressing the seed) reveal a hierarchy of values and culminate in an earned, emotionally resonant closure. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band; her single-minded pursuit lacks internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's hybrid nature and motivation are vividly embodied; his final choice to release stories is earned by prior realization and carries cost in the letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory—her "daringly methodical" tracing of errors coexists with the knowledge that the map is "useless." The final choice (to walk toward the river) is earned by prior causality: her guilt compels the search, and the graffiti wisdom offers a reconfiguration, not an answer. The cost is felt in her endurance of the "current she could swim against." No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is concrete and motivation is clear, rooted in scholarly habit and dream logic. The final choice to pen the letter is earned by prior beats with the watch and cipher, resulting in a decisive change with visible cost (the library fades, she is "no longer veiled").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and conflicted, with interiority shown through concrete perceptions and micro-choices. Her telepathy with plants and provenance researcher background inform her actions, and the final decision to play the violin is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her father's disappearance and the changed coffee stains.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her dual profession; her interiority is concrete and embodied ("her breath shaky with relief"). The final choice to place the spent chip is earned by the ritual's cost, though the emotional articulation leans slightly toward abstract reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation and interiority are concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (aching heart, creaking bones). Her final choice—releasing the hairpin—is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with felt cost. However, the contradictory impulses of forgiveness versus contentment are more sequential than simultaneously acting in scene, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motives are clear and conflicted, embodied through actions like handling the mirror shard. His internal struggle between money and guilt drives micro-choices, and the final understanding is earned via dialogue. Veyra's protected vulnerability adds depth, with relationship pressure forcing a credible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "the grotto's hum grew louder, vibrating through her bones"). The final revelation—stepping outside time rather than reversing it—is earned by prior causality (the grotto, rings, memory of grandmother) with visible cost in her changed understanding. Hairline slip: the conceptual cost slightly overshadows emotional depth, but contradictory impulses (fear of failing/succeeding) are present in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias serves as a thematic vehicle; his motivation is clear but interiority is abstract and lacks contradictory impulses or revealing micro-choices under pressure. The final realization is earned more by pattern than character causality, though the weathered resolve is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's underachieving mage trait drives his desperate motivation, embodied in numb fingers and fogged breath. Micro-choices (touching the keystone, unstrapping the satchel, drinking the light) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of grand spells for a simple flower is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the discarded satchel and transformed self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; his final renunciation of the key tag is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The woman's sharp ache mirrors his, adding relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied, with interior contradiction (reaper who remembers) driving the final choice. The naming is earned by prior causality, and the cost of centuries of weight is felt, though the heartbreak element remains slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("lukewarm mage," "earnestly naive"), with micro-choices (timing drops, using water) that reveal his values. His final understanding—that rebuilding is about listening, not perfection—is earned by his prior actions, with visible cost in the continued imbalance. No contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied ("his breath caught," "weight of the past settling into his bones"); the final choice to carry the photographs back is earned by the causal trail and shows a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora's contradictory impulses (wonder vs. quantification) act in scene; her final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality (flame failure, starlings, crystal) with visible cost in the shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interior contradiction is shown in his instinctual fighting versus racing thoughts. The final choice to "vivify what's left" is earned by the sparring and the jar's lesson, with cost visible in his acceptance of numbness as part of the spectrum. Minor deduction for occasional abstract emotional labels ("the void," "dissolved back into the void") that slightly thin embodied specificity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and her motivation to safeguard innovation intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices (planting the seed, moving it inside) revealing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as a tender of the unspoken, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, hitched breath). His steadfast dedication drives the climax, and the final renunciation (walking away) is earned with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is precise and embodied; her "dimensional homesickness" and motivation "to make friends with uncertainty" are concrete drivers shown through micro-choices (adjusting the pendant, kneeling at the book). The final choice—renouncing the need to wait—is earned by the preceding interaction and the cost of her longing is legible in the charged poise of the ending. Contradictory impulses (seeking answers/accepting uncertainty) act simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; his final renunciation of gold for the new is earned by twenty years of failure and the mentor's cryptic charge, with cost visible in the destroyed workshop and crozier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; her final choice to discard assumptions and tune for silence is earned by prior beats.

    Elias's ardent and resiliently positive nature is concretely embodied through his actions and interiority, driving the key choice to address the commuters.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lirien’s curiosity and determination are embodied through specific micro-choices (salvaging the chain, experimenting, teaching).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. persistent curiosity) are embodied in scene; her final choice to embrace the dead’s call is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the mist recoils, but the chorus of need remains, charging her smile with acceptance of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation (returning the codex, standing by) is clear and intensifies under pressure; his final renunciation (kneeling to stand by) carries visible cost. However, interior contradiction is minimal and emotional embodiment occasionally leans toward standard descriptors ("trembling," "claustrophobia a live wire") rather than deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied (heartbeat counting, porcelain shard handling). His motivation—haunted by "borrowed time"—is clear and intensifies under the ghost's pressure. The final renunciation (accepting he is "the space between" mistakes) is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in the persistent heartbeat rhythm. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("borrowed time he didn’t deserve") is anchored in concrete detail, preventing deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or deep flaw, making her determination feel one-note despite vivid interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pulling the arrowhead away, pressing the phone to his ear). His final choice to embrace metamorphosis is earned by a decade of chasing shadows and the garden's escalating weirdness. Maren provides secondary pressure. Minor weakness: some emotional states are summarized rather than fully embodied, but the closure choice is credible and costs are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's interior conflict and micro-choices under pressure are vivid, but the shift from duty to freedom relies slightly on a told realization ("The gap between knowing...") rather than fully dramatized contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Jace's interiority is concrete and embodied, his motivation to protest erasure clear and intensifying. His relationship with Mira acts as a crucible, and his final choice is an Earned Stasis with visible cost. A minor hint of diagnostic label-speak ("quiet rebellion") appears but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's silent persistence is embodied through concrete actions; his urge to sing and placement of the halo fragment arise from established traits, earning the final choice. Interiority is specific and filtered through his carpenter's perception, though internal conflict is subtle. The resolution feels motivated by his consistent belief in interpreting silence as possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's embodied perception and consistent curiosity drive the plot, but internal conflict is minimal, slightly reducing depth; final choice earned by prior causality with comfort as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's chronic curiosity and memory-driven investigation are concrete and compel his return, with embodied emotion in the climax. However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene; his final choice is earned but lacks internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and contradictory: her fractured reflection embodies internal division, her backward walking reveals avoidance, and her "combative tenderness" toward Mira layers fear with hope. Her motivation to mentor resilience quietly is dramatized through action (teaching Mira to walk backwards, explaining shadows) and rooted in a prior failure. The final charged poise is earned by her prior causality; the cost is legible in her flaring hope and fear. Minor deduction: Mira's character, while functional, is slightly less dimensional, serving primarily as a catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren's characterization is concrete and her motivation to preserve wonder is clear, but the absence of contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits depth. Her final act is earned by established traits, yet the lack of on-page struggle prevents higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's characterization is concrete and specific; his "methodically curious" nature and professional skill are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the tear, comparing film). His motivation—to interpret silence with empathy—is dramatized and compels the high-stakes choice to reopen the chapel. The final choice (reopening) is earned by his established traits and curiosity, with a felt cost in defying the village's silent grief. A minor deduction (-0.1) for a slight diagnostic label ("methodically curious" is named but well shown).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with death as a "colleague" shaping his perspective. His final choice to shatter the snow globe is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, but her ghostly nature limits embodied emotion and internal contradiction; her final fade is earned but lacks visible cost, keeping the characterization strong but not deeply flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interiority is concretely embodied through trembling fingers and understanding of the puppet.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied interiority. Lina's contradiction between her professional pursuit of permanence and personal unraveling is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (tracing the bottle, incising his name). His motivation—to find where stories begin—is consistent and drives the narrative, culminating in an earned realization. However, the abstraction of his quest slightly limits visceral engagement, though it fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. personal empathy) drive a micro-choice (reaching for Kael's hand) that earns the final renunciation with visible cost—the shared grief that lightens both their burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or flaws, rendering her a one-note do-gooder without significant cost or struggle. Her empathy and decisiveness are shown through action, yet there is no genuine conflict or blind spot that complicates her path. The emotional embodiment is present but not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena's contradictory impulses ("helix-minded precision flickering between obsession and despair") and the final, earned renunciation (choosing not to modify the mirror) are powerfully rendered. The core motivation—to reshape dreams—shifts credibly to becoming a witness, a change anchored in the embodied cost of the vision ("her own certainty wavering"). A slight over-reliance on abstract interiority labels ("obsession," "despair") in the opening paragraph prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through perception and micro-choices. However, the emotional range is narrow, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied conflict under pressure, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is concrete and specific; Elias's "eclectic pacifism" and tinkering are embodied in his actions and micro-choices (tuning the oscillator, listening with his hands). Interiority is filtered through his professional bias ("silence as texture"). Liora's arrival forces a stance crystallization—Elias's anger is immediately complicated by her weary reverence, and his final choice to use her fork is an earned, character-driven resolution that forecloses simple confrontation with visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s ambition and sensory trait are concrete; her defiance with Nara and earned shift to patience show contradictory impulses under pressure. Final renunciation is causally tied to the grandmother’s journal, with cost in the waiting.

    Eira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (flinching, trembling).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Courier's interiority is concrete and embodied (shaking hands, pulse quickening, throat tightening). Her micro-choice to let vibrations guide her inward is a credible stance crystallization earned by the pendant's buildup and stranger's provocation. The final earned stasis—hands steady, relic lighter—carries visible cost (pendant spent). Slight deduction for the stranger functioning more as thematic device than crucible relationship; their dialogue serves revelation over pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's attentive mysticism is concretely embodied through frost study and prism use; his shift from seeking proof to accepting communion is earned by the memory of the man's grief. Interior contradiction (belief vs. doubt) is present but quiet; final renunciation carries cost via the melted frost image. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible for the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied; her decision to journey arises from the palpable weight of silence, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost—leaving the orchard unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and specific ("shoulders hunched from years of bending over molten iron, hands calloused but gentle"), and his quiet determination burns beneath meekness, compelling his higher-stakes choice to seal the fissure. The final transformation—shoulders straighter, hammer ringing louder—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (sweat, ragged breath). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, but his resolve is consistently shown through micro-choices like studying the arches and working through the night. A hairline slip: the label "the meek one" is told but effectively supported by shown behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's sensory mapping profession and dream-driven motivation are concrete; interiority is embodied under pressure. The encounter with his other self tests his resolve, and his final choice is earned. Slight functionalism in the other Kael limits the highest band.

    Elias's grief and reticence are embodied and drive his actions; his final choice to leave the sea glass is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dye master's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with his post-surgery restlessness and watchfulness embodied in micro-choices (tracking sun trails, handling the wing).

The traveler applies secondary pressure, though her voice distinction is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation clear, with embodied emotion (numb hand healing). His change from seeing the tower as prison to vessel is earned, though internal contradiction is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (trembling fingers, tight throat) and a micro-choice to plant the seed and sing. The final act is earned by prior causality, though her character remains archetypal, limiting higher-band distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's compassionate nature is embodied through calloused hands and gentle actions; his internal conflict between hiding and acting is dramatized via micro-choices, and his final decision is earned by prior causality with visible cost in leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, anchored in his “creeping normality” trait. Contradictory impulses (seeking absolution, skeptical practicality) act in scene. His final micro-choice to plant seeds is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, with cost felt as the “weight in his chest felt lighter. Not gone, but tenuous.” The woman’s distinct voice and heuristic gentleness apply subtle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role; interiority is embodied through precise actions (trembling fingers, breath curling). His final commitment is earned by prior causality, but internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her background; her final choice to intervene feels earned, and the watch fob anchors her emotional stakes. However, her decision to step forward is slightly abrupt, lacking a clear micro-choice that dramatizes the internal conflict between her mission to "capture" and her impulse to act, which prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's skepticism and curiosity are concrete, driving her to follow the compass ring; embodied micro-choices (adjusting cuff, tasting copper) reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies, but internal conflict is minimal; the final choice is earned but lacks a visible, felt cost on the page. The mnemonic gift is stated rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and recent moral crisis; interiority is concrete (trembling fingers, methodical piecing). However, contradictory impulses aren't fully dramatized in scene, and the final choice, while earned, lacks a deeply felt on-page cost. The character is consistent but not complexly layered under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his seasonal muteness and role as a bell tuner. His interiority is concrete and embodied, though contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene. His final choice to continue preserving wonder is earned, with visible cost in the melting iceberg and shattered toy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Eli's interiority is concrete and contradictory, his micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the burning dome, the lost roses). The one minor flaw is the description of his scream as "raw, organic," which feels like a slight authorial intrusion into his mechanical POV.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation and interiority are clear, embodied through concrete actions (holding the locket, not opening it, asking around).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("feeling their weight... like a promise—or a threat"). Her motivation to "liberate... the truth" is clear and intensifies, though the initial "hadn't yet admitted it to herself" is a touch soft. The final choice to step into the chamber is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise earned by the pattern-solving, with cost felt in the laboratory's imminent fall.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's cautious interiority and embodied reactions (fingers tightening, breath catching) under pressure are precise; her final choice to listen with Mira is earned by the seal-triggered revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his "charmed skepticism" is embodied through micro-choices like tracing resonance structures with trembling fingers.

Liora's characterization is slightly abstract but functional for her role as an archived memory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lian's interiority is concrete and her motivation—to free herself, not destroy—is clear and earned. The rose thorn and key as extensions of her past give her micro-choices weight. However, the dialogue line "I'm here to forgive the unfinished" verges on thematic echo, slightly diminishing the embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority is embodied (shell biting skin, breath catching). The final choice to sing with Veyan is earned by her prior seeking, though the cost is more implied than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s motivation as a “salvager of echoes” is clear and intensifies, driving methodical investigation and a final renunciation. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., breath fogging icy walls), and the choice to keep silent is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the burden of truth. Contradictory impulses (seeking purity versus accepting ruin) act in scene, and the ending’s Earned Stasis feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation (duty, guilt) is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final choice. His internal conflict is embodied in specific memories ("the brother he’d failed to save") and the tactile hesitation before touching the key. The final choice to take the key and bear its weight is a credible earned endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight reliance on summary in depicting his regret ("guilt coiled in his chest") rather than fully dramatized contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his patience earned through mapping, and final choice to join the stranger is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in the quiet revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from personal escape to active resistance. His occupational competence is balanced with genuine fear, and his final choice to fight back is rooted in established traits and values.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's guilt and transformation are embodied and earned; interior contradiction drives scene, and his final choice to prove innocence carries visible cost from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion, though "calmly intuitive" recurs as a near-label. Elias's motivation to "map empathy onto action" is dramatized through his urgent response to the child's warning. His final choice is earned by prior setup of his trust in courage. Minor deduction for the slightly repetitive trait phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interior contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are concrete; his final shift from tourist to helper is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the parasol tip gift and clipboard acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Liora's embodied contradiction—calloused fingers tracing brittle paper, weight in chest lifting—earns her final micro-choice. Elias is functional but thin; the single POV justifies this focus. The final reach is motivated by the vineyard parallel, with cost in the raw admission "You hurt me."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is concrete and earned; honesty trait is embodied in choices, and the final realization—letting wisdom pass through—arises from prior causality with visible cost. Minor tell in "strangely honest" is offset by dramatized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and consistent, with clear motivation and embodied emotion. The final realization—that the masterpiece is the act of creation and that collective healing includes himself—is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("he had forgotten to live his own story").

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("his silence not born of disinterest but of reverence"). Motivation is clear and intensifies through on-page experimentation. The final realization is earned by his dedicated listening. A minor deduction for a lack of palpable internal contradiction or flaw-driven struggle beyond his obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong interiority and consistent traits; the prophet's forgetfulness is both flaw and driver. The final determination is earned by the tape's revelation, with visible cost in the cyclical struggle. Slight passivity when receiving the woman's instruction limits agency at the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is compelling with clear motivation and embodied emotion, but lacks interior contradiction acting simultaneously in scene, preventing higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his decisively kind actions under pressure reveal character. Interiority is concrete (the vinyl shard, tight throat) and emotions are embodied. The final choice to accept the second shard is earned, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a lifelong curiosity. Her interiority is concrete and her actions under pressure (descending, turning the key) align with her scholarly determination. The final choice to "close the loop" is earned by the preceding journey, though the climactic realization ("She understood.") is slightly told rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lena's contradictory impulses (skepticism and belief) drive on-page micro-choices under pressure; her final decision to embrace the changeling is earned by prior causality, with the cost of responsibility legible in the final image. "Forgiving skeptic" is slightly told but immediately demonstrated through action and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (earthbound star watcher, past failure). Interiority is concrete (sea glass heavy in palm, cold biting through robes), and micro-choices under pressure (wading deeper, touching pearl) reveal her determination. The final renunciation of her reckless method for reflective stillness is earned by prior causality (memory of father, sea glass analogy) with visible cost (memories that weighed her down). However, the emotional progression is somewhat tidy, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied (Mira flinching from a hug, pressing her palm to glass). Elias's watchfulness and Mira's withdrawal are consistent traits that intensify under the pressure of their shared, silent grief. The final choice to hang the pendant together is a micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values—understanding over judgment—earned by prior causality (his notebook, her taking the pendant). The only minor slip is a slight diagnostic lean in "her quiet proactivity finally given room to breathe," but it's anchored in the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; the final renunciation (to let hopes pass through him) is earned by the encounters, with cost visible in the acceptance of transience and the unfinished novel. The protagonist's confrontation with his creation serves as a crucible, though the motivation's abstraction slightly limits simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora is vividly drawn with specific whimsical details, and her motivation to reconnect with the earth is clear and drives the story. However, internal contradiction is minimal, keeping her from deeper complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, rooted in a lifetime of fleeting moments, and intensifies through the ritual. Interiority is concrete (calloused fingers, deliberate breath) and contradictory impulses (destroy vs. preserve) act simultaneously. The final renunciation—accepting the pause between heartbeats as the true safekeeping—is earned by the ritual's causality with visible cost: his envy of the frozen starlight and his history of burning moments to ash.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, from his "peripherally focused" gaze to his calloused hands. His motivation to capture echoes intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation—letting go of storage for release—that carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure; her final release is earned by the on-page endurance of tangible burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like tracing wood grain and savoring the kettle's whistle. Her motivation to carve emerges credibly from the accumulated weight of memory and the object's "hauntingly practical" patience. The final choice—to carve a quiet lion, embodying containment over harvest—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the reconfigured peace. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses (running from grief vs. sitting with it) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    Contradictory impulses of past resoluteness and present regret are embodied in scene; final renunciation to listen and let go is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the camera wheel sinks.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his micro-choices under pressure—hesitating then inviting the girl in, fixing the box, following the bear—reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character's interiority is concrete and particular (training to listen to static, rationalizing salvage). Micro-choices under pressure (boarding, opening crate, lifting mirror) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final charged poise—recognizing his distorted self—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (realization of a life spent chasing shadows). Slight archetypal feel limits higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, and interiority is concrete. However, there is no on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses, and the final charged poise does not involve a decisive change or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)

The final choice to use the key is motivated by the grandmother's challenge, though the emotional shift from defiance to acceptance is slightly abrupt. Micro-choices (tracing cracks, prying the hinge) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the closure shows credible endurance as she steps forward.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority and motivation are concrete and drive the climax; his sentimentalism and desire to break the cycle are embodied in micro-choices like pressing the gear. The relationship with Kael serves as a crucible, shifting from opposition to wonder with visible cost. Minor abstraction in "the weight of what he was about to do" does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with his patient reverence and grief embodied in micro-choices. The final act of draping the ribbon is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values. No second character on-page, so relationship dynamics are not assessed. The epiphany feels slightly mystical but is well-integrated through his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's ethically diligent nature is concretely embodied through decades of clock-winding and the tactile handling of the rake handle; his internal conflict between guilt and duty drives micro-choices (kneeling, transferring inscriptions) that culminate in an earned unburdening with visible cost—the transfer of sins to the pendulum bob.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and drives the plot; his blithe exterior contrasts with inner longing, earning the final realization with cost, though contradictory impulses are subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation as an ignorance cartographer is clear and drives the story, with interiority shown through her hesitation and predictive model.

The final choice to write is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in his role and the world's silence, intensifying to compel his experiment with dust. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "his breath caught" and "his voice rough but steady." The final choice—making dust speak—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the brittle laugh and indifferent mist. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the arc is coherent and cost-legible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (touching frames, picking up the mask). His motivation to complete the portrait intensifies through the vision, and his final renunciation—discarding the mask—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in scene, holding back the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is vividly drawn with clear motivation and internal conflict; his decision to surface is earned and carries cost, though the change is more stance than action, and contradictory impulses are summarized rather than simultaneously acted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Miss Voss’s interiority is concrete and her patient determination is embodied in micro-choices (ignoring Maren, persisting with the zither). The choir’s gradual change feels earned, though her internal contradictions are subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait (tasting memories), and intensifies credibly. Her "informally wise" characterization is shown through action (pruning, coaxing life). The final realization that her rebellion is about healing is earned by her journey. A slight deduction for interiority that occasionally leans toward poetic abstraction ("quiet certainty") rather than raw, embodied contradiction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness is concretely used in scene with Maren, and his motivation to preserve wonder informs his choice to enter the tower. However, internal contradiction is minimal and emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s characterization is specific and embodied; his lifelong cataloging of the unremarkable motivates his experiment with the orris root. The final renunciation of an answer is earned by the shard's effect and the house's heavier resumption, with cost felt on the page. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing. The micro-choice to use the shard reveals his values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The diver’s characterization is built through specific, pressured micro-choices (tightening grip on the ampoule, the slow exhale before acting) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her shift from seeking triumph to accepting nuance is earned by the on-page revelation and her hesitation. The statue's "incisively kind" telepathy functions as a secondary pressure, forcing the diver's internal conflict. A slight deduction for the final emotional state ("the weight of what it meant to truly understand") leaning toward diagnostic summary, though it's anchored in the concrete, shimmering violet light.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's grim optimism is concretely embodied through micro-choices like the dice roll and his final endurance; motivation roots in a desire to capture missed opportunity, earning his acceptance of change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character's insomnia, meticulous hope, and connection to the brush are concretely embodied, driving the choice to paint and distribute the portraits.

Motivation is clear and rooted in specific memories.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with concrete interiority (flour dust, dream). Her micro-choice to bake bread reveals values under pressure. However, the dream's overt symbolism ("the loaf spoke") and the rapid thawing of dread after the bees return slightly undercut the earned struggle. The final choice is credible but the emotional resolution feels somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s specific traits as a counter-clockwise clockmaker motivate his actions and final choice, which is earned with visible cost; however, internal contradiction or simultaneous contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, limiting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation earned with visible cost (discarding cloak, tearing photo). Contradictory impulses shown in mirror confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leeward's characterization is concrete and embodied; his core trait of turning obstacles into instruments is dramatized through micro-choices (dubbing the driftwood) and culminates in a credible, earned shift from interpreter to collaborator. Interiority is filtered through sensory perception ("salt in his veins") without diagnostic label-speak. The final choice—actively conducting the sea—is motivated by prior causality and carries the cost of reconfigured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation is concrete and rooted in her cartographer’s curiosity, with contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear) acting in scene. Her final choice to seek the cracks is earned by the discovery of the expedition, and the cost—realizing the watchers’ true purpose—is visible in her trembling hands and flight. Interiority is embodied and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interior conflict between truth and noble lies is concretely embodied; his final choice to preserve both is earned by prior causality and the confrontation with Liora, with visible cost in the acknowledged ambiguity. The trait "emotionally rational" is shown through pattern recognition and decision under pressure, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's stoically sensitive nature is concretely embodied (feeling despair without flinch) and drives micro-choices (writing responses) that culminate in a decisive, earned renunciation—becoming a "keeper of echoes." His hierarchy of values (wrestling meaning vs. measurement) is revealed under pressure with visible cost (empty inkwell). Interiority is character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his meticulous nature; interiority is concrete and embodied (trembling fingers, quickened pulse). The final choice to stay in the quiet is earned by the causal discovery of his lineage, with a visible cost in the reconfiguration of his identity. However, the epiphany is slightly neat, and contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized in the scene, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veyra's grief and cleverness are concretely embodied; her micro-choices under pressure (climbing, selecting dreams, making lanterns) culminate in an earned transformation with visible cost when the dream enters her. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final reconfiguration is motivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena's grief and determination are concretely embodied, and her final choice to run with new understanding is earned by the ghostly encounter. However, contradictory impulses are not simultaneously active in scene, preventing the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and his detachment gives way to a felt pull, earning his final choice. The pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” trait is vivid but borders on ornamental. The decisive shift from observer to participant is motivated, though the emotional transition is slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's guilt is embodied and contradictory ("sieve," "second heartbeat"). His final choice (breaking the watch) is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earned by prior causality (a lifetime of lies, the uncle's revelation). The uncle applies immediate, relevant pressure. A slight deduction for the uncle's expository reveal feeling somewhat functional, but the protagonist's interiority and transformation remain strong and closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory (wanting to untether but staying), with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Seris is slightly underdeveloped but serves the scene's pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's interior contradiction and embodied emotion drive the narrative; his final renunciation of the compass is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's contradictory impulses are embodied in scene; his final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the mirror chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and rooted in loss; her "paradoxically steady" trait is embodied in calm amidst trembling. The final choice to accept the transformed bond is earned by the painful on-page metamorphosis, with cost visible in her tears and the line "not as you remember." Minor over-description of emotion does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradiction in "willingly perplexed" drives devotion; final acceptance earned through ritual with visible cost in "choking beauty."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's steadfast pacifism and emotional resilience are embodied through concrete micro-choices (unflinching replies, a hitched breath). Her final act—becoming the wound—is earned by the accumulated weight of the memories she stitches, with visible cost in the empty locket and her newfound lightness. The emotional progression is credible and avoids diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's contradictory impulses (destitute philanthropist) and micro-choices under pressure are concretely embodied; his final transformation to feeling "necessary" is earned by the prophecy's cost (lightning bug darkening) and prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied, but lacks internal contradiction, preventing higher marks. Her calm inventiveness is shown through micro-choices under pressure, earning the final signal. However, no contradictory impulses act in scene, so not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in tactile interactions with the eels and earth. Motivation—the weight of the unpaid promise—is clear and intensifies, compelling his ritual. The final choice to complete the sequence is earned by his lifetime of reading patterns. However, contradictory impulses (e.g., fear versus duty) are not dramatized simultaneously in scene, limiting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his identity as a censored poet; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., fingers tracing the railing). His final realization—that some maps are only meant to be carried—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the acceptance of burden. No significant weaknesses; contradictory impulses act in scene under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is deep with embodied emotions and distinct voice; the mechanical arm and philosophical nature integrate seamlessly, driving motives. Elias's internal conflict and relationship with Isolde force choices that alter their dynamic by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lumen's contradictory impulses (denying poet identity yet carrying verse) are dramatized; his final shift from molting to rebuilding is earned by the key's promise and the library's call, with visible cost in relinquished vagrancy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's grief and creativity are embodied through specific actions like winding the clock and testing keys; his final encore is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the clock's ticking, satisfying the 9+ test for contradictory impulses and earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and her hesitation is embodied, but her final resolve feels somewhat rapid, leaning on the dream for a decisive change without a deeper, contradictory struggle in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and his motivation compelling, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and a final earned choice to mend. Minor deduction for lack of on-scene contradictory impulses; his regret is reflective rather than actively conflicted in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her background as a neutron star researcher, and her shift from cosmic drama to quiet observation feels motivated and credible. The contrast between her past work and present focus (“She had spent years chasing the dramatic… But the flood had washed away the noise”) lands as an earned reorientation. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-pressure—she reads as already half-converted at the start—so we don’t see strongly contradictory impulses in play. The final stance is more consolidation than hard-won change, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora feels specific—her past as a glass artist, the scars from the attempt, and her methodical following of frost patterns give her interiority weight. Her need to understand “why it had been taken” clearly motivates her choices. The contrast between her usual adaptability and this “different” kind of change is strong, though the line itself leans toward authorial labeling. The relationship with Jaren carries some charge but could show more complex contradictory impulses in the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to recover some form of music after losing his hearing) is clear, concrete, and consistently drives his choices. His survivor status and attachment to the tuning fork give him specificity, but his interior life remains relatively uncomplicated, with little on-page contradiction or moral tension. Liora functions more as a guide and concept-bearer than as a fully pressured character, though her steadiness plays well against his desperation. The final “triumph” feels earned emotionally but comes without much visible psychological cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The undertaker is specific, with a clear vocational lens and a believable combination of reluctance and compulsion (“once set on a path, would walk it until his boots wore through”). His motivation to answer the “distress signal” and his attachment to funerary rites align well with his choice to restore the light. Internal conflict is present but muted; he wavers in dread more than in any true ethical or psychological dilemma. The final stillness is earned, but the visible cost of that inner shift is relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivations are clear and consistent—protect the community, preserve memory, accept help—but she is rendered almost entirely as a steady moral center, with little visible flaw or contradiction under pressure. Her gentleness and resolve come through in concrete behavior (midnight runs, how she uses the bell) more than in deep interior conflict. The lack of a sharper internal tension limits the sense of cost at the end, even though her stance is emotionally credible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lien’s interiority is specific and embodied—unused love as “weight in her chest” and the tremor when she touches the tear feel particular, not generic. Her spiritual curiosity and half-remembered past life credibly motivate her actions in the present. The only soft spot is cost: relinquishing the tear reads as right and almost effortless, so we don’t quite feel a sacrifice or inner contradiction at the peak. Still, her arc—from uncertainty about the memory to accepting herself as a “pilgrim of sparks”—is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief, professional intimacy with the garden, and obsession with time are clear and particular, and her choices (testing the shard on the photo, stepping through the willow, using it on her mother) are all motivated by those traits. The embodied emotion is solid—details like the daughter’s photo and the garden’s touch land. Internal contradiction is only lightly explored: she moves quickly from horror to “I have to fix it” with little on-page struggle about the ethical or existential risk of rewriting time. The mother is vivid in a few strokes but serves mainly as catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira and Vey are both distinct and motivated, with Vey’s competence and reserve contrasted against Mira’s chained vulnerability and growing understanding. Interiority for Mira is present but relatively light; we get fear and dawning comprehension more than a textured tangle of impulses. The relationship dynamic—rescuer and bound helper—has potential but never quite becomes a crucible forcing a hard choice between them. The closing sense of Mira’s hope “unraveling” her chains is earned enough but could hit harder with more on-page internal conflict earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to resolve his grandfather’s “madness” and his own betrayal before cancer ends him) is clear and consistent, and his synesthetic perception gives his interiority specificity. The contradiction—once dismissing his grandfather’s work, now continuing it—is convincing and rooted in lived pain. However, the internal conflict stays relatively smooth; we don’t see him genuinely torn between incompatible impulses in the present scene, so the final acceptance costs him less on the page than it could. The relationship dynamics (with the grandfather and wife) are powerful but entirely off-stage, which slightly blunts their force as crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motive—stealing light to make moments luminous—is clear, specific, and carries through to her final shift away from “stealing.” Her interiority is embodied (jar pulsing, breath hitching) and consistent, though conflict remains relatively low-stakes and tidy. Kael is more evocative symbol than fully pressured character, but his contrast (“He didn’t steal. He reinterpreted.”) effectively exposes Lira’s blind spot. The final choice to miss the train is motivated but its emotional cost is only lightly sketched, not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and credible, with the glassblowing background, the mother’s warning, and the bookmark all coherently feeding his current malaise. His contradiction—seeking a “safe zone” while fearing exposure through unfinished work—is quietly but clearly dramatized. The final choice to “see what happens when the heat meets the glass” feels earned by prior reflection rather than a bolt-on epiphany. The main limitation is that his conflict stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied in sharper, on-page missteps or self-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply etched: the stunt double with a height phobia, stolen-child revelation, and practiced relationship with fear all feed directly into her present choices. Her adaptability and terror coexist in-scene (e.g., "her fear a living thing... but she had spent a lifetime outwitting it"). The caretaker is sketched but legible, and the final "Then let’s start over" feels earned by the prior emotional groundwork. A slight weakness is how cleanly her realization about vulnerability snaps into place, bordering on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s inner life is textured and mostly shown through concrete perceptions (the pebbles, the brittle booklet, the physical act of mapping by silence). Her core desire—understanding and then “retelling” the answers—is coherent, and the final renunciation of speech feels earned. The explicit line “Her motivation had always been to draw this map” is a bit on-the-nose and retrofits a life-goal rather than fully dramatizing its emergence. Emotional contradiction (awe vs. fear, attachment vs. letting go) is present but could be pushed harder at the climactic mapping moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    E-7X’s curiosity about the origin of thoughts is clear and character-defining, and his small but real shift from pure cleaning directive to purposeful seeker feels earned. His interiority is specific enough (the “static in the gaps between his code”) to avoid stock AI tropes, though it occasionally trends toward abstract summarizing instead of embodied contradiction. His final choice—to resume mopping but with altered intention—registers as an Earned Stasis with modest but legible cost (accepting uncertainty). The absence of other on-page characters limits relational pressure but suits the piece’s solitary focus.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Elias are cleanly drawn with distinct ways of relating to secrecy—her archival guarding versus his covert listening—and the final mutual opening feels earned. Elias’s “ambiguously clear” quality shows in his precise speech and evasive body language. The key choice (to drop the pretense and start over) is motivated by prior mistrust and their parallel hoarding of knowledge. The main limitation is that their inner contradictions remain relatively gentle; we don’t see either pushed to a sharper, riskier edge of self-betrayal or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched: his gnarled physicality, lifelong obsession with the maze, and self-deception about not needing the garden’s love all feel specific and embodied. His motivation—to earn a kind of acknowledgment from the garden while pretending indifference—is consistent and drives his micro-choices with the marbles. The final shift from wanting control to accepting the role of caretaker is earned, though the internal conflict remains more implied than directly dramatized in a peak moment. A touch more on-page contradiction under pressure could deepen the sense of cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her decision to override the AI and pull the lever tracks with her established obsession. However, we get very little contradiction or real inner struggle—she never seriously entertains not doing this, so the choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won. Emotional responses are largely generalized (“her heart pounded,” “half wonder, half despair”) rather than deeply particular to her history or flaws. The final “weight of it” is told rather than fully dramatized through a specific, character-revealing reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lena’s motivation—unraveling the program’s code and finding/playing Elias’s lost work—is clear, consistent, and drives each action beat. However, her interior conflict is fairly thin: she moves from curiosity to acceptance of the supernatural with little hesitation or contradiction, so we don’t see much friction between fear, skepticism, and artistic drive. Her emotional experience is mostly implied through atmosphere rather than sharply embodied, character-particular reactions. The final realization that “the music would never be lost again” feels earned but not especially costly or self-revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched: feverish, guilty, and oddly relieved by the fallibility of his own gift, with clear motive rooted in the abandoned village. His internal contradictions—comfort in uncertainty vs obsessive guilt—are credible and specific. The final repricing of his role (“The oracle’s burden wasn’t to be right—it was to be present”) is earned by prior beats. Some emotions are stated a bit directly rather than fully embodied under peak pressure, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is sketched clearly as reckless and skeptical, and his choice not to run plus the final offering of the wheel give him a modest arc. However, his deeper motivation (“the truth he’d swallowed years ago”) is introduced late and remains vague, so his need to be here tonight feels retrofitted rather than organically built. Interiority is competent but not deeply particularized; we don’t see a strong, specific inner contradiction play out on the page. The encounter changes his stance, but the cost of that shift is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper’s stance as witness rather than actor is clear and consistent, and her choice to relinquish the book to the river fits that ethos. However, internal conflict is faint: the moment where she wonders if she is “a story waiting to be unfolded” flickers and vanishes without much on-page resistance or cost. Emotional life is more conceptual than embodied, with little sense of bodily reaction or degradation under pressure. The result is textured but emotionally cool characterization that doesn’t fully earn the final endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly and consistently drawn as gentle, attentive, and tuned to “ordinary magic,” and his profession folds smoothly into his behavior. However, his interiority stays relatively summary-level—his “second heartbeat” mystery is told rather than deeply dramatized in embodied, contradictory feeling. The encounter with Liora moves him, but we don’t see real ambivalence, fear, or resistance that would complicate his longing. Liora herself is mostly a function of wonder and recognition rather than a fully individuated child.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply etched through concrete, idiosyncratic details (“odd historian,” ink- and ash-stained fingers, listening to walls) and a consistent perceptual style. Her motivation—to collect the stories walls have heard—is clear and threads the whole piece, culminating in her reaching for the tapestry-door. Internal contradiction is present but underplayed: she questions whether she has been looking backward instead of forward, but this doubt doesn’t generate much on-page struggle or visible cost. The final act of touching the door feels earned, but the emotional price of that choice (risk of losing her world or identity) remains more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and history with Linus are clear and specific, and his actions (researching the log, hunting where the light bends, examining the microdot) are well motivated. His emotional life, though, stays relatively streamlined—he moves from intrigue to acceptance with little on-page contradiction or cost. Linus is vivid in retrospect but mostly as a clever archetype rather than a fully troubled person. The woman in the peacoat functions mainly as a plot catalyst, with minimal depth or pressure beyond her role.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions even at the risk of possession—is clear and consistently dramatized through his ritual. The fear/curiosity tension (“Before the possession completes… What if the possession wasn’t something to fear, but something to understand?”) gives him a credible internal conflict. However, his emotional states often remain at the same cool, lyrical register; we don’t see enough degraded thought or messy contradiction as the stakes rise. The final acceptance feels earned but somewhat low-cost because his flaws and blind spots never bite back on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and textured—“chronologically homesick” and the way she clings to the nautilus shell and the fortunes feel character-particular. Motivation (rebelling against numbness by mapping memories) is clear and coherent. The piece hints at contradiction (numbness vs yearning for agency) but never fully tests it in a concrete choice, so we end without a clearly foreclosed path or visible cost. Still, for this lyric scope, she reads as a distinct, non-generic consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is clear and consistent, especially his sense of being “fractured” and his temptation to escape himself. The progression from fear/curiosity to the final renunciation (letting go of the door / tablet) is motivated and earns the shift from fractured to “whole.” However, contradictory impulses aren’t fully dramatized in the peak confrontation—his hesitation before killing the older self is brief and mostly intellectual rather than embodied. Adding a sharper, more irrational pull toward power or avoidance there would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira and Elias both feel specific and embodied: Elias’s deafness and tactile relationship to sound, and Mira’s history of “screaming into the void” give them textured motives. Mira’s numbness is dramatized rather than told, and her final shift—letting the hush in and reconfiguring her pain into something playable—feels earned. There is some mild therapy-adjacent phrasing (“emotional numbness,” “fix her”) but it’s grounded by concrete behavior. The relationship dynamic (teacher and damaged student) carries pressure without lapsing into stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is specific and credible—meticulous, solitary, and professionally defined—while his curiosity and unease feel grounded in his history with storms. The internal tension between “refuge in solitude” and “integrity demanded more than observation” is present but sketched rather than deeply dramatized. His emotional life is more inferred through setting and diction than fully embodied in contradictory impulses. The closing decision to act is motivated, but the cost is only lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, avoidance, and compulsion to seek answers are specific and coherent, with embodied emotion (the trembling fingers, flinch at scents) rather than labels. His final choice to keep the vial feels earned by prior beats and carries a believable cost. The gardener-figure is effective but somewhat archetypal and oracular, with less individualized motive or contradiction. Internal conflict is present (wanting answers vs fear of pain) but could surface a shade more sharply in on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirien’s motivation (“to discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistently dramatized through her tactile, sensory engagement with the grotto and rope. Her ethically playful streak adds color but rarely complicates her choices with real cost, so internal contradiction at the moment of choice remains mild. The fear-versus-surrender realization is conceptually strong but lands more as articulated insight than as a deeply dramatized struggle. Still, her interiority feels particular rather than generic, and her final choice grows credibly from what we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation (to find beauty in the unfinished and to listen for what the world still says) is clear and coherent with her choices: coming to the greenhouse, playing, then using the bowl to deepen the connection. Interiority is specific and tied to objects—the violin, the bowl, the absent bonfires—rather than generic summary. However, she faces almost no real opposition or internal contradiction; there is little sense of risk that her belief might fail or cost her. The final endurance—continuing to listen in a ruined world—reads more as gentle affirmation than a pressured, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s characterization is vivid and specific—her profession, habits, and self-protective detachment feel grounded, and Darian’s quiet compliance sketches a believable dynamic. Her conflicting impulses (caring vs. faked empathy vs. distance) are there but mostly articulated rather than forced into a hard on-page choice. The final endurance—continuing the arrangement while briefly imagining belief—is believable Earned Stasis but relatively low-cost. Strong, but a notch below top-tier because the inner conflict never truly bites in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s values and motivations are clear and consistent, especially his sensitivity to “unseen gears” and his choice to act on the misdelivered envelope. His curiosity vs. respect for privacy creates a small but credible internal conflict when deciding whether to open it. Mara is efficiently sketched with physical detail and history, and her reaction to the photo feels grounded. The final decision to help with the fund is thematically aligned but carries limited visible cost or deep internal struggle, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s longing for kin and her hesitancy (“She had spent her life crafting others, never daring to claim a place among them”) give her a specific, credible motivation that cleanly drives every choice. Internal contradiction—her urge to stay at the margins vs. the risk of reaching out—is there but could be deepened further on the page. Secondary characters are lightly sketched yet functional, with the scarred woman providing a clear social pressure point. The final change—sacrificing the sculpture and accepting “you’re one of us now”—feels earned and consistent with what’s been built.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s goal and long obsession are clear and consistent, and her fear/strain are embodied through breath, burning pendant, and physical hesitation. However, she is largely linear and unconflicted: once she commits, there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine doubt. The interiority is competent but not piercingly particular; we don’t get a distinct contradiction or flaw that sharpens her choice at the hourglass. Her final act (turning it) feels motivated, but not costly in a way that reveals deeper character.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—combining his grief for his sister with a quasi-scientific urge to “measure the unmeasurable.” Interiority is concrete and embodied (“a warmth that spread through his ribs like sunlight through stained glass”), and his actions align with this mix of precision and tenderness. What’s missing for a higher band is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible flaw under pressure; he moves through the ritual with relative calm and competence. The final shift toward acceptance feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the crawl-space existence, gentle routines, and compulsive archiving create a distinctive psyche, and the sense-memory of his mother feels earned and specific. His fear of exposure versus desire for connection is legible in the choice he hovers over with Mara. However, his “kindly methodical” nature isn’t truly stress-tested under peak pressure, and the scene stops just short of forcing a concrete, value-revealing decision. Mara functions more as a charged possibility than a fully pressured relationship on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s characterization is clear, specific, and rooted in occupational detail; we feel her as a meticulous, slightly controlling observer of plants. Her internal conflict between controlling growth and surrendering to a stranger form of transformation culminates coherently in her decision to “let go.” The shift is fast but earned through earlier hints (old texts, her history with rare specimens). Emotional experience is mostly embodied, though a few lines verge on thematic abstraction rather than showing contradiction through action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The painter’s interiority is vivid and particular—the insomnia, the compulsion to follow the rain, the tactile relationship with paint and brooch all feel embodied. His contradiction (“I paint to remember” / “you paint to forget”) gives him a genuine fault line, though it’s mostly articulated by her rather than dramatized in his choices. The closing decision to take her hand is motivated and legible but comes with only a brief hesitation, so the cost of that choice is underplayed. Secondary characterization (the woman) is efficient and suggestive, but their dynamic doesn’t have quite enough frictive push to fully earn a high-band emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s gift and sensibility are specific and appealing (“noticed the magic in mundane things”), and his disorientation when that small-scale gift fails him is effective. However, his inner conflict remains underdeveloped: he mostly observes and reacts rather than making fraught choices that expose deeper contradictions. The pilgrim is sharply sketched but more archetypal than individuated. The final realization that the forces are “hungry” lands, but it feels more conceptual than deeply earned through a layered interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation as an archivist trying to reconstruct erased history is clear and consistent, and it drives every choice on the page. Interiority is concrete enough (her awareness of patterns, the weight of the valves) but internal contradiction and visible emotional cost are only lightly touched. Dain functions more as a competent ally than a pressure source, so their relationship never truly becomes a crucible. The final realization about erasure is earned but could land harder with more dramatized inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias feels specific—his profession, habits, and perceptual bias (seeing “hidden veins” and patterns) ground him as a believable, competent obsessive. Motivation to investigate is clear, and his micro-choices (following the pavement arrows, listening at the manhole, climbing down) align with that. However, there’s almost no internal conflict; his “didn’t hesitate” acceptance undercuts the chance for a richer contradictory impulse at the crucial decision. The relationship with the conductor is intriguing but underdeveloped as a crucible—she tests him only lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s skepticism versus his latent desire to believe is clearly established and motivates his key choices (touching the tile, then choosing to write). Interiority is specific enough—linking the grid to his grandmother’s constellations gives him texture beyond a generic seeker. The internal shift from dismissive to quietly committed feels earned, though a few lines lapse into summary labels (“The skeptic in him wanted to dismiss it”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The cost of his change is subtle—emotional and conceptual rather than materially felt—which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    Veyra’s core motivation and weariness are clear and consistent, and her immortality meaningfully shapes her desire to understand “after goodbye.” However, her internal conflict around the hinted sacrifice is underdeveloped—she hesitates but we never feel a sharp, contradictory pull between fear and desire in the peak beat. Kael functions as a serviceable but thin foil with limited depth or surprise. The final emotional shift (“for the first time in eternity, she wasn’t afraid”) lands, but feels a bit neat relative to the modest on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s ambivalence as “the undertaker’s boy” and the con artist’s son is clear and specific, and his final choice to withhold full cooperation (“Prove it”) feels rooted in that history. His interiority is textured—his relationship to objects, scams, and his mother gives him dimension beyond the scene’s immediate problem. The woman is functional but thin; her bruises and goal are effective shorthand but don’t quite rise above type. The internal conflict at the end (help vs. control) is persuasive but could carry a sharper felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer’s motivation—to “collect the textures of different times” and make sense of the town’s silence—is clear and consistent, and his actions (obsessive note-taking, attending to the hum, writing the final line) align with this. Interiority is present and particular (“ink and patience,” attraction to “spaces between words”) but his inner conflict remains muted; we don’t feel him pulled sharply between competing impulses. The shift to peace at the end is credible but low-cost and not strongly dramatized as a renunciation of any alternative path. Strong, nuanced characterization, but not yet searing or deeply self-contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and psychology are clear and specific—the death certificate and the poison label credibly drive his behavior. Interiority is textured (“searching for the texture of memories”), but contradictory impulses under pressure are mostly implied rather than dramatized in discrete choices. His final stance shift (not needing to run from the tide, accepting layered truths) is earned but understated, with limited felt cost on the page. The woman is intriguing but sketched more as a catalytic figure than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s role as a professional skeptic is clear and his shift toward wonder is motivated by the shell’s visions and the astronomer’s lines, but his inner conflict remains more implied than deeply dramatized. Moments like “He had come to debunk a myth, but the myth had reimagined him” show a credible arc, yet the turn hinges on quick realizations rather than pressured, contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional responses are mostly filtered through atmosphere instead of concrete bodily reactions under strain. Secondary figures exist only in echoes, so relational pressure is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lan is sharply sketched—her background, role as a “culture shock absorber,” and knack for pattern-seeing all drive coherent, motivated tactics. Internal conflict between serving investors vs. the carnival is stated more than dramatized, and we rarely see her truly tempted or torn in-scene. Her micro-choices (notes, food sabotage, graffiti) align with motives but feel low-risk, so the final belief in “choosing the raft” carries limited visible cost. Old Man Vey appears only at the end, so their relationship never becomes a crucible for harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and particular—an aesthetic, almost spiritual desire to witness and preserve rather than conquer—and they drive his on-page choices (touching the regolith, using an old camera, honoring the untouched crater). His interiority is textured with concrete habits (rolling the sand grain, watching breath fog) rather than labels. The main limitation is that his internal conflict remains gentle; doubt vs conviction never quite sharpens into a hard, pressured contradiction. The closing realization about the sand grain skirts the edge of being articulated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, competently rendered character: a blind artisan whose reliance on touch, sound, and memory feels embodied and particular. His motivation to decode the drone’s feedback before the ship departs is clear and consistent. What’s missing is sharper internal contradiction or visible emotional cost—he is calm and assured almost throughout, so the final affirmation feels like confirmation rather than a hard-won shift. Mara functions mostly as a gentle prompt rather than a true source of relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, temperament, and obsession with origins are cleanly motivated and consistent, and her choice to go to the lake’s center arises credibly from that drive. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her cartographic mindset (“the way the old ink bled into the cracks of the world”). Internal contradiction is relatively soft—she’s focused more than torn—so the emotional cost of her decision remains understated. The keeper is sketched effectively as a foil but remains thin beyond his reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tuner’s worldview and motivation (“Ghosts…were not spirits but echoes, and echoes could be coaxed back into song”) are clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his actions. His patience, gentleness, and craftsman’s mentality come through in concrete choices like refusing to “force the rhythm” and pacing the square in market-day patterns. What’s missing at a top-tier level is palpable internal conflict or contradiction under pressure; he never risks being wrong or pushed to a limit. The ending endurance/renunciation (he leaves and “does not look back”) is quietly credible but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motives (professional skill, loneliness, attachment to her mother’s gift) are clear and consistent, and the choice to open the vial feels earned by what we know of her. However, internal contradiction under peak pressure is lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized—her fear vs. duty vs. hunger for connection could all cut sharper in the final chamber. The emotional cost of losing the vial is implied more than embodied. The distress-signal sender is more function than character, but that’s acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s core motivation—untangling his father’s legacy and confronting “hush”—is clear and consistent, and his final act of speaking his name feels earned. The lineage from “the boy who cried wolf” gives him immediate psychic baggage that informs his obsession with silence. However, his interiority skews conceptual and lyric more than concretely embodied under stress; contradictory impulses (fascination vs. fear, guilt vs. defiance) are implied more than dramatized. The emotional cost of his choice is present but could be sharpened through more specific, conflicted micro-choices in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and specific—the compulsive return to the solstice greenhouse, the gnawing sense of debt, the mix of attraction and dread toward the bride. Contradictory impulses (flight vs. surrender to remembering) are legible and drive the climax. The relationship with the bride is emotionally charged but intentionally blurred (sister/lover/both), which enriches ambiguity but slightly softens the specificity of their shared history. Her final acceptance of the bead’s meaning feels earned and clearly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation (“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”) is clear and coherently expressed through her relationship with the plate, the labyrinth, and the loom. Her interiority feels specific—salt air, shipwrecked library, the splinter-like image—rather than generic emotion labels. However, her internal conflict under pressure is relatively mild; she moves from uncertainty to acceptance without a truly fraught, contradictory moment. The final choice to let the labyrinth “sew her into its story” lands, but the cost is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he returns to restore a buried faith—and his choices (pursuing the orchard, placing the sundial) align with that drive. Interiority is textured and embodied (“a warmly curious hum settled in my chest”), but internal conflict is thin; there’s little genuine doubt, fear, or competing impulse on the page. The emotional trajectory feels largely linear from determination to vindication, with few messy cross-currents. The final realization is earned but relatively comfortable, with limited visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s profession, habits, and obsessions are specific and coherent (pseudonym creator, fixation on surface mail, inherited codebreaking clipboard), and his curiosity and caution feel motivated. However, his deeper emotional conflict about his name/identity only crystallizes in the last line rather than being dramatized under pressure. The mother-son relationship arrives fully formed at the end without much prior emotional groundwork on the page. The closing realization is thematically apt but slightly under-earned in terms of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s vocation, observational rigor, and quiet courage are clearly established, and her choices (decoding the pattern, deciding to act, adopting a disguise) all arise credibly from those traits. Interiority is present but relatively thin; we’re told her hands tremble from “the weight of what she had begun to notice,” yet we rarely see sharper, contradictory impulses under pressure (fear vs duty, despair vs hope). Her emotional journey from doubt to committed action is plausible but somewhat smoothed over, with little visible cost beyond generalized anxiety. The final stance—accepting a watcher/listener role as the coup begins—lands, but it could carry more felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s motivation—seeking the “moment before deciding” about the unsent apology—is vivid, consistent, and layered with fear, guilt, and avoidance. Her micro-choices (coming to the labyrinth, pressing the shard to her scar, speaking “I was afraid”) reveal a credible internal conflict between the desire to repair and the comfort of silence. The sister-apparition is more emblematic than fully realized, but it’s sufficient for this length and function. The final endurance choice (keeping the letter unsent but emotionally reweighted) feels earned and carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena’s interiority is rich and particular—translator background, war injury, and the coral’s pull all cohere into a credible psyche under pressure. Her mix of numbness, compulsion to return, and sudden protective focus on the boy reads as a live contradiction rather than a neat arc. The micro-choices (coming back despite evacuation, scratching at the cast, choosing connection over clarity) are motivated and revealing. The only limitation is that her change at the end is more contemplative than decisively costly, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s artistic drive and relationship to “joy” are specific and consistent, and her choices (seeking the light, salvaging the fragment, returning with the print) are cleanly motivated. Interiority is textured (“lodged in her chest like a splinter”), but her internal conflict remains relatively gentle—there’s more yearning than contradiction under pressure. The final lift (“the apple within reach”) is emotionally earned but low-cost, more subtle shift than crisis. Secondary characters are minimal and function more as chorus than as pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s methodically playful nature and restorer’s eye give him a distinct sensibility, and his curiosity-vs-certainty tension is implicit in his actions. Interiority is textured more through perception than explicit emotion, which works but keeps him a bit abstract under peak pressure. His arc—from wanting to “restore certainty” to realizing the mural is a door he’s being asked to enter—reads, but the cost of that shift is more implied than embodied. A touch more contradiction or fear in the final beats would deepen him from intriguing to indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias and Quill both read as specific, with clear roles and complementary temperaments, and their motives (retreat vs. defiance) are grounded in the hinted history of the club. Elias’s shift from withdrawal to engagement (“Show me where to start”) is motivated and credible, though his interior conflict could be more deeply embodied. The relationship dynamic—Quill needling Elias out of hiding, the inspector providing external pressure—works well as a crucible. Emotional texture is present but sketched rather than fully layered.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—is vivid, coherent, and consistently dramatized through his insomnia, retreat to the shell, and eventual surrender to writing. His interiority feels particular (reading light-constellations, conceptualizing the “blossom armistice”), and his actions align with that sensibility. The final shift from paralysis to writing reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat cure. A slightly sharper dramatization of his competing impulses in the present moment (write vs. preserve silence) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s vocation, habits, and interior texture are specific and consistent—her meticulous care for orchids and relics makes her drive to preserve names feel rooted and credible. The “foxglove regret” and decades-long tenure hint at inner cost without over-explaining. However, her internal conflict remains relatively low-friction: we see longing and quiet obsession, but not a sharply dramatized contradiction or a hard on-page trade-off. The final softening realization feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (restore a dangerous, truth-binding language) are clear and consistent, and her expertise and hesitation under pressure feel specific and embodied (“carefully reckless” is nicely dramatized in her choice to proceed). However, her internal conflict stays relatively tidy—there’s limited real tug-of-war between fear and drive on the page, and her final leap feels slightly under-costed emotionally. The absence of another on-page character limits relational pressure, keeping the crucible largely conceptual rather than interpersonal. Still, her arc from cautious scholar to active risk-taker reads earned within the scene’s bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and specific—protecting the valley while honoring the volcano’s history—and her competence with the mechanism feels grounded in lived experience. The internal conflict between “betrayal” and stewardship is dramatized in micro-choices (handling the chain, deciding to open the envelope, how she interprets the letter). Embodied detail like her fingers on brass gears and the tremble before opening the envelope keep emotions concrete. The final reorientation from guilt to continuity is earned, though the cost of her prior misgivings could be shaded a bit more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: the failed musicologist hiding as a pigeon trainer, mapping dust to control a chaotic past, is specific and convincing. His guilt over the lost archive and his compulsion to track patterns ground his motives. The internal conflict—keep running versus face the past—is present but could be embodied more intensely in the scene; his final choice comes with relatively little on-page struggle. Lena is sketched efficiently with a distinct stance, though their dynamic could bear slightly more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, guilt, and obsessive searching for pattern in wood grain give him a clear, particular interior life, and his final acceptance reads emotionally credible. However, his internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized—there are few concrete moments where contradictory impulses collide in the present scene. Mira exists only as an absence and image, which limits the relational crucible on the page. The final renunciation (turning away from the terrace with the logbook still in his pocket) is earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s core motivation—seeking the “rhythm of belonging”—is clear and carries through to his hesitation at the closing passage. His interiority is evocative but relatively light on specific, scene-anchored contradiction; his final choice to leave feels emotionally plausible but under-interrogated on the page. Liora functions more as a guide and mouthpiece for exposition than as a full pressure-bearing character. Stronger embodiment of Elias’s conflicted impulses in the climax would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s vocation and obsession with “lost things” give her a coherent, particular interior life, and her shift from “nothing is truly lost” to accepting that some paths should fade is a credible earned stasis. Her emotions are mostly shown through interaction with objects (crater glass, seed) rather than abstract labels. However, her internal conflict is more posed as tidy questions than dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses under genuine pressure. The piece could use one sharper moment where a real cost makes her waver before she settles into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s motives (boredom with her act, desire to “orchestrate serendipity”) are clear and consistent, and her decision to toss the bishop and improvise is psychologically grounded. Her analytical streak is nicely particularized (reading patterns in breeze, embers, laughter), giving her more texture than a generic “restless performer.” However, internal contradiction and real struggle are light; she moves from dissatisfaction to solution with little friction or cost. The violinist is a pleasant presence but thin, adding little pressure or relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s characterization is vivid and specific—her elective exile, relationship to the moonstone, and ambivalence about being forgotten all feel coherent and grounded in embodied detail. Her choice to risk criminality is motivated and in character, though the internal struggle around that decision is sketched more than fully dramatized (“She should have refused” moves too quickly to acceptance). The tattooist is distinct in image and desire but remains more emblematic than deeply individuated. The final shift—from solitary exile to shared outlawry—lands, but the emotional cost could be deepened further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific—a harbor glazier with a long, concrete relationship to light—and his curiosity and unease after the dream plausibly drive his actions. His skepticism vs. pull toward the atrium gives him some internal tension, but it’s underplayed on the page. The final understanding comes a bit too cleanly, with minimal dramatized struggle or cost. The old woman is a functional catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply realized: his scars, compulsion to return to the forest, and notebook of fire patterns and poetry all align into a coherent, particular interior life. His motivation to "translate pain" plausibly fuels the choice to stay, listen, and write with the stranger. The stranger is more sketched than excavated, but details like the silver seam at their throat give them weight beyond a device. The final softening of Elias’s grief feels earned rather than epiphanic, though the internal conflict could be pushed harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s perceptual lens (equations in waves, obsession with patterns) is specific and consistent, and her motive to “revitalize” hope through pattern-finding is clear. The final reorientation—recognizing the gauge as a bridge and recommitting to the work—feels earned by what’s come before. Internal conflict is muted, though; there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk in her choice to embrace this revelation. The character is textured but not yet under enough pressure to reveal deeper contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by his father’s legacy and curiosity, with embodied reactions (the satchel, the burned diaries, the humming walls) that make him feel particular rather than generic. However, his internal conflict—fear of being consumed vs. compulsion to continue—is more implied than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses. The father is sketched effectively through obsession with walls, giving the legacy emotional texture. The woman is intriguing but mostly functions as an expositional figure, with limited pressure on Elias beyond her existence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation—to capture and in some sense midwife the mirage—is clear and consistently rooted in childhood experience and her mother’s “grace.” Her interiority is sensory and particular rather than generic, and the watchman gives a light but effective relational counterpoint. What’s missing at this level is a sharper internal contradiction or visible cost to her belief; the shift from seeing to believing is evocative but comes easily. The final stance feels earned texturally, but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora is vivid and specific: weary, ideal-driven, and honestly ambivalent about what remains of her when peace comes, with embodied detail in her relationship to the clipboard and coin. Kessar’s worldview is sketched efficiently and his shift to “maybe it’s what we choose to carry” feels earned by the scene. The internal conflict—peace as redemption vs. surrender—is clear and active, not just summarized. The final choice to “carry it together” grows credibly from what we’ve seen, though her exhaustion could complicate that decision a bit more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched: the “amoral philanthropist” who engineers a drought yet hoards pressed flowers and a dead sister’s photo is vivid and specific. His sentimentality versus cruelty is integrated into his choices, especially using the drought as a “vessel” for the birds’ echo. Internal conflict is more conceptual than moment-to-moment embodied in the scene, so the decision to release the drought reads calm rather than pressured. Still, actions align cleanly with his established motives, and the quiet endurance at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s vow, history of refusal, and need for proof of resistance give her a coherent, specific motivation, and her memories while untangling the threads map cleanly onto that drive. Her interiority is anchored in concrete acts (first refusal, comforting others) rather than labels, which keeps her from feeling generic. However, her internal conflict is relatively muted—she hesitates only briefly with the black thread and then succeeds without visible psychological cost beyond a single sharp inhale. The final shift into “finding her voice” is believable but a touch tidy for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motives and worldview are clear and particular—her ethic around storytelling, the tension with her brother, and the pull of performance all cohere. However, her internal conflict stays mostly conceptual; we don’t see contradictory impulses bite in the present scene, only a resolved serenity. The brother relationship operates off-stage, so the “crucible” pressure is remembered rather than lived. The final stance (“The work was just beginning”) feels earned but low-cost, with little sense of what she is giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s motivation—to honor the monarchs and the overlooked—feels clear, embodied, and consistent, and it directs every choice she makes in the grotto. Interiority is specific to her sensibility as an “esoteric realist,” especially in how she attends to shadows, names, and relics. The internal tension between hope (that the monarchs will come/return) and acceptance of impermanence is understated but present. The closing acceptance (“the signal had been sent. And that was enough.”) is earned by prior beats and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: a craftsman whose training in lost-wax casting informs how he thinks about memory, absence, and repair. His guilt over the foundry collapse and, more pointedly, over “the silence that followed” grounds his motive to work with the rope. The final decision—“He would do this again, he decided, for every scrap of sound he could find”—is credibly earned from those traits. What keeps this from the very top tier is that his internal conflict (between moving on and obsessive atonement) stays relatively un-contested on the page; we don’t see him nearly lose his nerve or choose one value at the cost of another in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and attraction to liminal spaces are clear, and his micro-choices (going to the bunker, reassembling the seal, following the dream-woman) track his motive. However, his internal conflict is light: we don’t see real resistance, fear, or competing values that make these choices costly. The woman is more an oracular function than a character with pressure or agenda. The final “understanding” feels earned enough for a quiet piece but doesn’t expose a deep flaw or contradiction in him.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nabu-sharru’s frugality, devotion to study, and willingness to risk his life for knowledge are clear and consistent, and his key choices (stealing the tile, entering the palace, surrendering the tile) track with those traits. Interiority is textured but relatively calm; we don’t feel much contradictory impulse (fear vs. conviction, temptation vs. humility) once the ritual begins. The interaction with the veiled figure reveals values and status dynamics efficiently. The final acceptance of a covenant with the future rather than the unknown is motivated and credible, though the emotional cost could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradiction as a “scheming pacifist” is sharply articulated and drives the core tension between revenge and release, with embodied responses (trembling hands, pin biting into her palm) grounding her interiority. Her final softening toward Veyra (“she found only pity”) is motivated by the remembered kindness and the sanctuary’s magic, though the emotional pivot risks feeling a touch compressed for the depth of her lifelong resentment. Veyra is thinner but serviceable as a foil shaped by forgotten violence and emergent guilt. The closing choice to release some of her resentment and “learn to dance” reads earned, if on the mild side of costly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mirror maker is sharply sketched—practical yet quietly drawn to the uncanny—and his choice to pursue and hold the dream coheres with what we know of him. His interiority is mostly implied through actions and perceptions rather than explicit conflict, so the internal struggle feels gentle rather than pressured. The final understanding about trust and loneliness grows credibly from his lifelong occupation with reflections. What’s missing at this standard is a more embodied sense of cost or contradiction under pressure as he decides to follow and then keep the dream.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is concrete, embodied, and particular—the quartz-eye mender with the frayed satchel and ribboned wrist reads as a full person with history. Her motives (persistence, grief, a half-conscious wish to bridge generations) are clear and consistent, and her choices with the pendant and what she promises/not-promises feel earned. However, internal contradiction is relatively soft; she rarely feels truly torn on the page, so the emotional stakes never fully sharpen into a painful dilemma. The girl is sketched efficiently but leans a bit archetypal, mostly serving as a foil rather than a fully pressured agent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The curator’s interiority is specific and convincing—her trembling over the glass, retreat to the bathroom, and mental “inquiry” all feel rooted in a particular temperament. Motivation (obsessive need to understand the orchard and shell) is clear and consistent. Internal conflict is present but mild: doubt vs compulsion rather than a sharply dramatized contradiction, so the final shift toward awe has limited felt cost. The closing stance change is credible but emotionally low-risk, more contemplative than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives (curiosity, professional competence, and the search for her sister) are clear and drive her choices, and the diary as lifeline is a strong character-specific touch. Her “carefully resourceful” nature appears in her negotiation and navigation tactics, though internal contradiction under pressure is only lightly sketched. The time traveler is serviceable but thin, existing mostly as a plot vector. The final emotional beat with the sister lands but could carry more ambivalence or cost to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (find Liora / understand what happened) is clear and consistent, and his embodied engagement with objects (the swatch card, the ledger) gives him some specificity. The recapture-vs-understanding tension surfaces late but does reframe his goal at the climax. Liora, though intriguing, remains more emblem than person, so the relationship’s emotional cost doesn’t fully land. The final merge/erasure beat feels emotionally legible but could use one sharper contradictory impulse on the page to be fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s core traits—curiosity, professional rigor, and a refusal to ignore the impossible—are well-grounded and consistently drive her choices (entering the room, working the rope, deciding to archive the truth). Her archivist mindset is convincingly embodied in tactile actions and perceptual focus on objects and records. Internal conflict, however, is relatively muted: there’s little real hesitation or competing impulse when facing the moral weight of exposing an obliterated house. The final commitment feels credible but not hard-won, which lowers the ceiling for deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ryn’s motivation—to find and preserve a pocket of silence—is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her professional identity as ripple-mark mapkeeper gives her a specific lens. Interiority is present but relatively light; we don’t see many contradictory impulses under pressure, just a focused, almost serene competence. Her key decision to bind the bloom to the stone feels motivated and earned, and the partial success/partial loss at the end carries a modest but legible cost. What’s missing for higher-band work is a sharper sense of her flaws, blind spots, or inner conflict complicating those choices.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to rekindle the idea of the beacons and prove coincidences have meaning—is clear, character-specific, and consistently expressed. His interiority is vivid in sensory terms (taste of old rain, weight of lost cities) but his conflict remains mostly one-directional; we don’t see much simultaneous doubt or competing impulse. The final choice to leave the pavilion is well prepared but its emotional cost is only lightly sketched (“as if it knew he wouldn’t be back”) rather than deeply felt. This is strong, but not yet at the level of fully thorny, contradictory interior life.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage and reshape identity through memory—is clear, particular (“preemptively nostalgic”), and consistently tied to her profession and worldview. Her internal conflict between constructed identity and unearthed self is well-articulated in the fossil metaphor. The final decision to walk the fog bridge backward feels earned by this throughline, though the emotional cost remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. A slightly deeper embodiment of fear or doubt at the end would push her arc into truly outstanding territory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora is specific and textured—a wandering fireworks designer with a modest self-concept and a bone-deep pull toward this task. Her motives (answering the mosaic note, bringing light, grappling with hopelessness) are clear, and her craft background plausibly shapes her competence with fire. What’s missing at this level is sharper internal contradiction or a truly pressured choice; she moves through the scene with relatively little friction. The final understanding lands, but it doesn’t feel like a costly or contested renunciation so much as a graceful acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and specific—her observational warmth, avoidance of the conversation, and sideways approach to mystery feel like a coherent psyche. Her key choice (to experiment with the cicada, then to return to her brother) is motivated by established traits. The internal contradiction—flight from the talk vs. compulsion to engage with the cicada and, finally, the silence—is present but somewhat understated, so the cost of that last decision could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s interiority is rich and specific—her history with silences, her relationship to confined space, and her attachment to the doll all feel earned and coherent. Her choice to defy her father and step onto the trellis is clearly motivated by a lifetime of bunker-bred constraint. The internal tension (fear of tight spaces vs. hunger for vastness) operates on the page, especially in how she reframes her own coping: “By limiting exposure, she told herself, she could survive.” The boy is lightly sketched but functional; their dynamic could sustain slightly more pressure, but it does not undercut her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and coherent—a gondolier attuned to silence and pressure, with the storm glass as a tactile extension of his sensitivity—and his impulse to speak breaks his habitual quiet in a believable way. The woman is sketched economically but clearly through concrete cues (ink-stained fingers, half-finished notebook, grief-driven need to control silence). Emotional progression from tension to relaxation is convincing, though internal contradiction remains gentle rather than sharply dramatized. The closing sense of “approval” from the storm glass lightly externalizes Elias’s own self-assessment, giving a small but earned shift rather than a profound change.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Veyra’s motivation (restore a world “unraveling without its rightful steward”) and professional identity as lore keeper are clear and consistent, and her choice to test the bark first shows a specific, thoughtful temperament. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: she rarely doubts or resists, so her decision to sit on the throne feels almost inevitable rather than hard-won. Emotions are mostly implied through physical response and setting rather than richly embodied or contradictory states. The closing burden of heirship is sketched but not deeply felt as a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadow keeper’s conflict between self-exile and latent healer impulse is clear and embodied in her hesitation at the door and the burning scar. Her past as a healer versus her present as a gatekeeper of denial gives her a credible contradiction. The child is thinly sketched but functions well as a pressure point and mirror. The final choice—reaching for the scar—is motivated and costs her the safety of isolation, though that cost could be shaded more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s mix of shame, curiosity, and regret is well-grounded, and his final refusal to step through the portal feels motivated by what we know of his history with the pyramid scheme. The interiority is concrete (the warmth of the bolt, the weight of “what ifs”) and his small but real reorientation toward teaching others is earned. However, the “virtuously mischievous” trait is more told than dramatized, and Mara remains more thematic mouthpiece than fully pressuring presence. A bit more contradiction or messiness in Elias at the decision point would deepen the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and his choice to seize and use the crank is coherent with his history and goal. However, his interiority stays relatively straightforward—there’s little on-page contradiction or real hesitation under pressure. The great-uncle apparition is more a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized presence. The final realization reorients his understanding but doesn’t yet register as a choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aldric’s withdrawal, war trauma, and half-articulated hunger for “possibility” are clear and consistent, and his final renunciation of the sword tracks with these traits. However, his interior conflict stays relatively muted; he moves from unease to surrender with limited on-page struggle or contradiction. The woman functions well as a pressure source but has little depth beyond archetypal seducer/guide. Strong characterization for the length, but not yet at the level where the final choice feels painfully inevitable rather than simply apt.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—a gentle, wounded man whose vocation and temperament are coherent with his actions. His motivation to “magnify small kindnesses” nicely explains why he fixates on the button and on Daniel rather than the system in the abstract. Internal conflict is relatively mild; we glimpse his grief but he is never forced into a truly difficult choice, which keeps the arc modest. Still, the shift from burdened mourner to someone lighter and newly purposeful feels earned for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motives and traits (underestimated, stubborn, quietly competent) are clear and drive her choices, and her embodied reactions (key in pocket, steady pulse, bitter laugh) keep her from feeling generic. However, her inner conflict is relatively muted—she rarely wavers, doubts, or contradicts herself on the page—so the final act reads more as fulfillment of an archetype than as a deeply conflicted decision. Lines like “hoarding scraps of truth like coins in a beggar’s cup” suggest a rich interiority that the story only partially exploits.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—to answer and neutralize the prophecy via music—is clear, consistent, and rooted in his history with his grandmother’s melody. His interiority is specific to his craft (the reed, the case’s weight, the negative-space playing), which keeps him from feeling generic. However, his internal conflict remains muted; we don’t see competing impulses (fear vs duty, resentment vs devotion) in real tension on the page. The final endurance/return-to-duty stance is credible but could carry a sharper sense of ambivalence or cost to deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s motive (to find pattern in the leaves) is clear and rooted in her identity as an “orderly seed sorter,” and her habits of monument-building and tending neatly dramatize that trait. Her skepticism about ghosts versus faith in patterns gives her a quiet but coherent internal stance. However, we get little simultaneous contradiction or real struggle in her inner life under pressure; the transformation is more declared than wrestled with. The final stasis—her calmly sorting leaves for names—feels apt but emotionally under-complicated for elite-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear core trait—obsessive precision challenged by randomness—and his choice to follow the compass into the unknown is motivated and consistent. However, internal conflict is more labeled than dramatized; “uncertainly certain” and “to befriend uncertainty in planning” state his arc rather than showing competing impulses in action. His emotional experience stays relatively cool and abstract, with little embodied response even at the waterfall or in the frozen city. The final shift to “Uncertainty was not the enemy” lands conceptually but feels somewhat pre-declared rather than earned through messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent, and her final choice to return the coin reads earned. Her precision-versus-grief framing and reaction to seeing her given name carved in the anvil feel psychologically credible. Elias, however, remains more a thematic function than a fully embodied counterpoint; his “clarity” and self-exile are asserted more than dramatized. The internal conflict could be sharpened by putting Liora in more overt tension between the need to understand and fear of what she’ll find.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The collector’s burden, weariness, and quiet rebellion via seeking true laughter read as specific and motivated, and his small but clear shift at the end feels earned. His emotional life is mostly shown through perception and small actions rather than labels. However, his internal conflict (failed guide vs. seeker of laughter) stays relatively smooth, with little on-page struggle or contradiction under pressure. The woman-ghost is evocative but lightly sketched, functioning more as catalyst than fully realized foil.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his attempt to quantify pain, his reaction to ultraviolet light, and his ambivalence about “gift or curse” all feel character-particular rather than generic. Motivation (seeking the “mathematics of mercy”) is clear and consistently tied to his trauma history. The encounter with the stranger and the decision to drink are plausible but somewhat low-friction; contradictory impulses (terror of UV vs. need for answers) could be dramatized more viscerally in the moment. The final stance—“It was about knowing when to stop”—reads earned but also slightly neat for the scale of his suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation and vocation are clear and particular (“between-worlds translator” who honors overlooked histories), and her choices—taking the fragment, tracing the painting, writing, making the locket, returning—track cleanly with those traits. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory response to the fragment rather than abstract labels. However, internal conflict is minimal; she rarely faces a genuine dilemma or contradictory impulse, so her final stance costs her little on the page. The arc feels more like deepened alignment than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is clearly sketched as quietly competent, observant, and accustomed to the supernatural, and her micro-choices (staying calm in the dark, examining dust, choosing to use the mainspring) align with that. However, her internal conflict is minimal—she rarely feels genuinely torn, and the emotional cost of her attunement to these “wounds” is only lightly implied. The final shift (“for the first time in years, felt the weight of something lift”) is effective but not deeply prepared as a hard-earned transformation. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the layered, contradictory level expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has a clear vocation, history, and driving obsession (“compressing eternity into a moment”), and his choices move the story. However, his interiority is largely conceptual rather than emotionally embodied, and we rarely feel contradictory impulses in the moment—he accepts the library’s destruction almost too smoothly. Lines like “He had spent lifetimes…” hint at cost but don’t quite dramatize his attachment. The final shift in belief is earned in logic more than in felt, character-specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation rooted in past failure, and his actions (the mirror ritual, the final invocation) align with that motive in a coherent way. His interiority is textured—“burnished sorrow,” stubborn idealism—but we rarely see genuine internal contradiction under pressure; he doesn’t seriously doubt, rage, or waver. The relationship with Liora does good crucible work in a brief space, establishing status and values clash. The final act reads psychologically earned, though it would land harder if we had seen more active inner conflict about the cost or futility of trying again.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s inner contradiction—honest self-image vs years of quiet self-deception—comes through clearly and ties into his craft and history. The childhood memory + father’s death gives his reaction to the chip concrete emotional grounding. His final choice to face his fractures and use the chip feels earned, though it tilts a bit quickly toward clarity once the stranger explains the stakes. The stranger is mostly a thematic mouthpiece rather than a fully pressured character, but he still functions as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivations (grief/curiosity about his grandfather, fascination with petrichor, the valley’s silence) are clear and consistent, and his choice “to delve” feels naturally grounded in those traits. The psychometry moment adds a nice, specific shading of his inner life and family history. However, under peak pressure with the grandfather’s emergence, his interior conflict is underplayed—he “understood” very quickly, with little struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. The closing act with the vial reads more as smooth acceptance than as a choice with visible, emotionally felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is sketched with clear, particular traits (driftwood sculptor, “perpetually learning”) and his skills credibly drive the climax when he carves the bridge. However, his interiority remains relatively thin: he accepts the supernatural situation almost without friction, and we don’t see much real ambivalence about joining this order. The final “finally understood” epiphany feels a bit neat and lightly earned given the lack of dramatized inner conflict. Mara works effectively as a guide-figure but is more functional than psychologically alive.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s artistic obsession and long-standing question about night-blooming flowers give her a clear, consistent drive, and her actions (going to the cathedral, returning to the pavilion, altering the mural) all align with that. Interiority is specific and sensory—postcards on her lap, breath fogging the glass—rather than generic. The arc from restless searching to a quieter acceptance of “that was enough” feels earned, though the internal conflict is gentle rather than sharply contradictory. The realization skirts the edge of being a bit too tidy but is sufficiently grounded in her history and behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and motives are cleanly established—the archivist who literally touches the past and defies Rourke’s warning to seek truth under threat. Her retrocognition and embodied reactions (smudged glasses, trembling fingers) particularize her, and Lila is sharply sketched in a few strokes. However, Elara’s internal conflict is underplayed: she moves from discovery to risk-taking with little on-page ambivalence or moral calculus. The relationship between Elara and Lila is functional rather than fully a crucible; it doesn’t significantly alter either character by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched as an austere, stubborn mind chasing a radical solution; his staying in Hollow’s End and turning to mental experimentation feel motivated and in character. The line about “alchemy in reverse” and rejecting false comfort grounds his worldview. However, we get little in-scene contradiction or emotional wobble—he rarely feels torn, only resolute—so internal conflict stays relatively flat. The closing hope is earned but carries limited visible cost beyond prior isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and textured—his vocation, childhood memory, and response to the orchard and phonograph all feel individualized rather than generic. His motivation (to archive emotional patterns / probe the foghorn’s silence) is clear enough, and his actions track logically from it. The internal shift from dutiful archivist to someone who recognizes and embraces the “invitation” of silence is credible but carries limited visible cost or contradiction on the page. The piece could reach a higher tier with sharper tension between duty to the Archives and his dawning subversive intent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation (understanding and using the vortex inheritance) is clear and rooted in years of endurance, and her actions with the acorn cap and hatchling follow cleanly from that. Her interiority is specific—“furiously tranquil energy,” the remembered apple trees—rather than generic grief or wonder. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; she’s uneasy about curse vs blessing but rarely feels genuinely torn on the page. The closing stance shift (from guarding to “reopen the past…to carry its weight forward”) is earned but could carry a sharper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation (to trust her listening over the priests’ noise) is clear and drives both the wire-switch rebellion and her delayed pull of the rope. Her competence and long practice are well grounded ("tracked microclimate variations for years"), and her mistake feels earned rather than contrived. Internal conflict is present but relatively lightly drawn; we don’t see deep, moment-by-moment contradiction as she debates whether to pull. The closing stance—she’ll keep listening despite nearly catastrophic error—reads as an earned, character-specific endurance, though its cost is more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is cleanly drawn as a humble, devoutly attentive figure whose life of maintenance and watching makes his response to the falling star feel grounded. His motivation (“to find strength in vulnerability”) is mostly dramatized through his choices to stay, tend, and witness rather than told. However, internal contradiction under pressure is light—the piece leans toward a single, coherent longing rather than clashing impulses in the key moment. The final shift from “janitor” to “witness” is earned but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s core trait—chosen silence in response to visible ghosts—is clear and consistent, and his final act of opening the box is credibly motivated by the beekeeper’s ghost. The interiority is evocative but somewhat generalized; we’re told about “the weight of his own unspoken words” more than we feel a layered, contradictory emotional texture in the moment. The covenant (silence for solitude/peace) is intriguing but under-dramatized; its stakes could be made sharper or more embodied. Still, his endurance and small break in pattern read as an earned stasis/change with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and burdened sense of duty are clear and consistent, and his choices (seeking garage sales, testing the key, accepting the role of timekeeper) are well-motivated. However, his internal life skews more conceptual than conflicted; there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine resistance when he realizes he must replace the woman. Emotions are evoked through image more than embodied contradiction, which slightly flattens the psychological stakes. The final decision to embed messages feels earned but not paid for with a sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and embodied—“silence was a living thing, coiled around her ribs”—and her motive (tending grief, seeking beauty in the incomplete) clearly drives her micro-choices. Her shift from passive grieving to active weaving/writing feels earned by the feather, the snapped string, and the woven dawns. There is some slight abstraction in the epiphanic language, but it remains grounded enough in concrete stimuli that the emotional progression reads credible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated—preserving the orchard and its ethos against developers—and his choices (remodeling as defiance) align with that. His embodied calm and ritualistic care (“His hands moved with a gently systematic rhythm…”) feel specific and characterful. Internal contradiction is limited; he barely wavers, so we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull beyond quiet acceptance vs. resistance. The final endurance (he works despite knowing he’ll die and lose the land) is credible but emotionally under-intensified for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s skepticism, academic arrogance, and grudging curiosity are all clear, and his decision to come, to carry the amber, and to hand it over to Liora feel causally rooted in those traits. His interiority is specific enough (“weight of his own skepticism like a second skin,” sleepless nights in the lab) but his final shift toward “something like belief” comes a bit too smoothly, with limited friction at the peak moment. The relationship with Liora is suggestive rather than developed; their dynamic could pressure him more directly. Overall, characterization is strong but the internal conflict resolves a bit tidily for elite-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motive—to “fertilize the idea of return” and let the garden reclaim the battlefield—is clear and consistent, and his small but real endurance at the end (doing what he can despite knowing it may not matter) reads as an earned stasis. Interiority is textured and particular (“spoke dead languages… lingered in the silence between things”), without therapy-speak. However, there is little on-page contradictory impulse or real moral friction; his choice never meets robust resistance. The lack of visible cost beyond a slightly heavier heart keeps the characterization from feeling fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: the war bloodhound turned recluse with maps of the dead and a shaking hand is vivid and particular. His core contradiction—fleeing ghosts while obsessively mapping them—feels earned, and his choice to accept the new hunt grows plausibly from that flaw. The emotional texture is mostly embodied rather than labeled (“breath rattling like a phonograph needle,” trembling hands). The one limitation is that his final decision comes with minimal on-page hesitation, softening the sense of real internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and coherent: the “blessed pariah” who maps time instead of fleeing it feels distinct, and his relationship to the compass and family legacy is well-rooted in concrete objects and habits. His final stance shift—from isolation as prison to threshold—tracks with his lifelong drive to “turn confusion into exploration.” The main limitation is muted internal friction at the peak; fear and loneliness are named but never strongly contest his curiosity, so the cost of his choice feels low. A touch more visible ambivalence or sacrifice in the closing beat would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirien’s motives (wonder over greed, chivalrous thief ethos) are clear and consistent, with embodied reactions (pulse, breath, tactile focus on chess pieces) grounding her. The thrill/fear mix around the guardian gives her some inner contradiction, but it never quite forces a hard, costly choice. The guardian is more atmospheric than psychologically present, so relationship pressure is limited. Her closing shift toward embracing the invitation of the wind feels earned but relatively low in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora is sharply sketched—crisis actor turned “real” survivor, wary of being a pawn—so her desire to unbind from imposed narratives feels motivated and specific. Her micro-choices (keeping the chessboard, coming to the gallery, asking “Then teach me”) track cleanly with that psychology. Internal contradiction (her complicity in performance vs. wish to be historian) is implied rather than dramatized in scene, so the emotional struggle stays a bit abstract. The man is intriguing but thinly rendered beyond his function as catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s desire “to understand the shape of home” and his history as a mercury-glass seer give him a specific, textured interiority. His actions (studying the journal, tracing the map, descending to the stone) align with this motivation and feel coherent. Internal conflict is hinted (visions substituting reality, painful remembering) but rarely dramatized in-the-moment as contradictory impulses. The final realization is earned enough, but the emotional cost of that shift could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s guilt, exile, and chess-trained mind are rendered with specific, character-particular detail (the fidgeting, the decoding of threads, the way he treats memory as a puzzle), and his final stillness reads as a credible earned shift. Internal conflict between wanting to revise the past and needing to live with it is present throughout and sharpened in the masquerade memory. Liora’s brief appearance still carries weight and pressure, though she remains more emblematic than fully dimensional. A touch more embodied turmoil in the peak memory scene could deepen the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s defiance, ambivalence about the ritual, and hunger to “mend herself” create a coherent, specific interiority, and her choices (agreeing to the poetry, postponing the ritual) stem clearly from those traits. Echo’s playful pressure functions well as an externalization of her impulse to break rules. However, her internal conflict around the elders and penance stays mostly conceptual rather than being tested in a concrete dilemma on the page. The final stance—ritual can wait—feels earned but its emotional cost is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—scars, breath, and tactile engagement with the statue reveal a coherent, wounded psyche. His core motivation (making sense of fragmented memories and staving off oblivion) is clear and consistently dramatized rather than told. The final shift from fragmentation to integrated memory is earned by his earlier obsessive pattern-tracing. A bit more visible ambivalence or cost in reclaiming painful memories could deepen his internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s regret, aging body, and artistic history give him a textured inner life, and his micro-choices (taking the wrong turn, diving after the shell, entering the tunnel, choosing what to paint) align with that. His motivation is coherent and escalates from simple return to a deeper reckoning. The final shift—accepting that he’s not here to reclaim but to reframe—feels earned. Some feelings and realizations are stated a touch directly rather than dramatized through contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsession with “whispers travel farther than shouts” is clear, consistent, and elegantly dramatized through his attentiveness to vibration rather than light. His passivity is balanced by purposeful, small choices—the way he experiments with the cork, uses the storm, and refuses to argue with Maren, which suits his thesis. The relationship dynamic is clean: Maren’s skepticism and authority apply believable pressure without melodrama, and her silence at the end registers as a shift. Internal contradiction is present but quiet rather than fully dramatized; we sense his vulnerability more by implication than by explicit tension between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias has a coherent, particular motivation (sister’s disappearance, “geography of loss”) and a consistent inner lens, but he faces little real internal contradiction or dilemma on the page. His actions mainly consist of following instructions, with no strong moment where competing impulses clash. The censer and the calls reveal him as patient, haunted, and methodical, yet those traits are asserted more than stress‑tested. The final choice to walk on feels fitting but emotionally underleveraged, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives (a truth-teller desperate for psychological safety) are clear, specific, and consistently drive her choices from taking the eye to burying it. Her internal conflict—wanting protection from honesty while being drawn to a relic that might finally shield her—plays on the page rather than in summary. The final renunciation of the eye feels earned, with a visible cost in giving up a possible “cure.” The only slight limitation is that her “involuntarily truthful” trait is told more than dramatized in an on-page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is clearly sketched as solitary, ritual-bound, and quietly curious, and his choice to “investigate” through contemplation rather than rummaging is character-specific. His emotional responses are mostly embodied through sensory attention and routines rather than labels. However, his internal conflict is relatively low-grade—there’s little sense of competing impulses beyond mild unease versus duty—so the final “promise” doesn’t feel like a high-cost renunciation. Strong, but not yet at the level of deep contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as a solitary, duty-bound man whose life has narrowed to maps and a burdensome inheritance. His internal conflict between the inherited promise to keep the shop and the lure of the door is clear and culminates in a credible shift when the promise suddenly “felt hollow.” Emotions are mostly embodied through tactile engagement with objects (maps, chip, water), though a few lines lean on summary (“felt something akin to hope”). The final choice is earned but could show a sharper sense of cost or fear in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The queen’s interiority is textured—her weariness, certainty that this is an “invitation,” and calm acceptance undercut by a faint unease all feel specific. However, her internal conflict is minimal; she moves from palace to grotto with little real resistance or contradiction on the page. The transformation at the mirror is credible but emotionally undercosted, with little sense of what she fears losing. Still, her motives and reactions are consistent and character-driven across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—capturing “the density of presence” and testing whether Elias is “still you”—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to share the moment rather than hoard it feels earned. Embodied detail (the curl pressing into her skin, her stained fingers) grounds her interiority. Elias is sketched efficiently with a palpable cost (“Time…Not the kind you measure, but the kind you feel”), but he remains a little more idea than fully conflicted person. The inner conflict is present but relatively tidy; we don’t see her wrestle with a truly painful alternative path before committing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid, specific, and self-contradictory: envy of past selves, fear of his foretold death, and compulsion to “distill chaos into narrative” all coexist and grind against each other. His emotional state is embodied (iron and pine, the hollow in his chest) rather than labeled. However, his micro-choices in the present scene (beyond reading/considering burning the scroll) don’t quite crystallize into a decisive stance, so his arc lands as a charged continuation rather than a shift or renunciation with clear on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply realized: the loss of smell, the tactile relationship to gears, and his attunement to vocal tremors all cohere into a specific psychology. His shift from framing himself as “missing something” to “holding it” is earned by the scene’s choices rather than declared. Clara is less deeply explored but still credible, with the steadiness of her hands and the history with her grandmother doing efficient work. The emotional arc is nuanced, though the internal contradiction in Elias (resentment vs acceptance of his loss) could be sharpened a touch more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is textured and specific: her shame as a failed daughter, professional frustration, and grief over her mother coexist and drive each micro-choice with the quill. The tension between rational scholar and dismissed “youthful superstitions” gives her a credible internal contradiction. Her shift from seeing scars as failures to seeing them as stories feels earned by the earlier failures and memories. The only limit is that the emotional resolution borders on tidy rather than leaving sharper ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s guilt, professional history, and ambivalence about miracles are sharply etched and consistently drive his choices, especially his decision to perform a risky, makeshift ritual after years of withdrawal. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“the violinist whose hands had moved faster than his prayers”), and his flinch at violins plus his methodical unpacking of tools undercut any savior fantasy. The final stance—accepting listening over fixing—feels like an earned endurance rather than a neat cure, with visible cost in his continued solitude and the orchard’s loss. The curator is thin but functions adequately as a low-pressure foil.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving and then unifying words/illusions as the last witness—is clear and consistent, and her relationship to the dictionary and the stone effectively reveals who she is. However, her interiority leans archetypal and abstract; we get little of her specific fear, doubt, or selfishness under pressure. The line about having “outlived the need for” a name gestures at complexity but isn’t followed by embodied contradiction in the moment of choice. Her final transformation into “first weaver of the new” feels earned conceptually but relatively uncostly on an emotional, character-particular level.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is specific and textured—his counting ritual, tactile intimacy with the machinery, and calm, methodical responses undercut by unease all read as lived-in. Motivation (to restore and understand the clocks) is clear and consistently expressed in choices like re-counting and testing the key rather than panicking. The internal contradiction is relatively mild (duty-bound technician vs. quasi-mystic seeker), so the emotional arc feels more tonal than deeply conflicted. His final conceptual shift is earned but could register with more visible inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and Mara both feel specific and non-generic, with his intrusion-detection background and her long-term seeding of spores creating a believable, slightly uncanny connection. Motivation is clear—his desire to understand “how things move through barriers” and her need for a collaborator who “can see what I see.” The emotional stakes of “letting go” remain somewhat abstract and under-dramatized; we’re told about his old life more than we feel him torn between it and this new path. The final choice (accepting the vial, pressing the button) is earned but would land harder with more visible internal contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority—debt, exhaustion, grief, and intellectual curiosity—feels specific and coherent, with her father’s sayings clearly shaping her worldview. Her motivation to decode his work and reframe his legacy makes the final decision (“She would burn the numbers herself”) feel earned. The contradictory impulses (responsibility vs. attraction to risk, resentment vs. loyalty) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in live choices, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully acute. The librarian provides a nice relational pressure point but doesn’t significantly alter Elara’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara is sharply etched: her “cultivated estrangement,” refusal to correct callers, and ritual with the disc create a coherent, particular psyche. Her core contradiction—choosing distance while becoming an intimate witness to grief—is well dramatized, especially with the woman calling for Daniel. The emotional palette is embodied through small behaviors rather than labels. The one limit is that her internal conflict at the end (“wondered if she had done enough”) remains more implied than actively dramatized in a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, archivist vocation, and need to preserve Liora are specific and coherent, and his final renunciation of the locket clearly grows from those traits. The internal conflict between holding on and releasing her is legible and layered rather than purely declarative. However, we get more stated disposition (“gently thorough”) than dramatized contradiction or blind spots under peak pressure, so his inner life never quite reaches maximal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s loneliness, pattern-obsession, and forced cheer are crisply drawn, and his decision to surrender the moon rock and his fantasy of being “saved” feels motivated and coherent. The internal shift from needing rescue to holding a “beginning” is clear and earned, though his contradictory impulses seldom clash directly on the page. The logistician is intriguing but mostly functions as a cool, underexplored catalyst rather than a fully embodied foil. A touch more embodied, moment-to-moment struggle in Elias (e.g., real hesitation over handing over the rock) would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive and interiority are clear and specific—she’s a blind emotional cartographer whose trust in the heirloom ring and responsiveness to the forest feel grounded rather than generic. Her emotional change at the stillpoint (understanding her own grief/longing/rage) is earned by the journey, though it comes a bit easily, with little visible resistance or contradiction on the page. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see her genuinely torn between paths or values. Still, she reads as a particular person, not a type, with coherent choices that culminate in a believable, if gently rendered, shift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s interiority is textured—her guilt over “planting the wrong seeds,” reliance on others, and fear of making things worse all feel specific and earned. The contingent relationship with Elias nicely externalizes her fragile confidence. The final stance shift (“The past wasn’t a fixed thing—it was a draft, and she was the editor”) is motivated but comes relatively cheaply, with limited visible cost. A bit more contradiction under pressure or a sharper price for deciding to act would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s grief, relationship to silence, and desire to be seen are specific and consistent, and Elias’s quiet support is clear, but their inner contradictions under pressure are only lightly sketched. The strongest moment is her continuing to “map” silence despite past erasure, yet we don’t see a sharply conflicted impulse (e.g., to withdraw vs. to reach). The relationship dynamic is tender but largely untested, so it never quite becomes a crucible. The final sense of change—feeling seen—is earned but relatively gentle and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s drive and competence are clear, and the Ember Scribe has a distinct, if slightly archetypal, zealot intensity. However, Elara’s pivot from hunter to ally (“Then let me help.”) happens with almost no on-page hesitation or conflicting impulse, which flattens her interior complexity. Embodied emotion is present but leans on familiar beats (“breath hitching,” “pulse quickened”) rather than character-particular textures. The relationship dynamic shifts in status (hunter vs hunted to partners) but does so too smoothly to feel fully earned at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motive (find Liora) is clear and consistently rooted in his past with the lagoon and the sound wave garden, and his embodied reactions under the serum are concrete. However, his interiority leans more toward straightforward yearning than conflicted complexity—there’s little sense of competing impulses once the process starts. The decision to volunteer is told rather than dramatized, and the scientists are purely functional, not relational pressures. The final “we” transformation is earned enough, but the cost to his individual selfhood is more implied than emotionally worked through.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias feels specific—his maintenance background, superstition around the coin, and obsession with "identifying walks" give him a clear, coherent psychology. His motivation to decode the map and prove the whispers is strong, but he rarely wavers internally, so we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine cost. The woman in the slicker is intriguing but mostly functions as an avatar of the counter-walk rather than a fully pressured character. The final choice—to hand over the key—reads as consistent but not deeply conflicted or costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maris is specific and memorable—the silent guardian with tactile habits, tools, and a practiced craft—and the child feels plausibly wary and curious. Her motives (teaching through silence, not speech) are clear and consistent. What’s missing for a higher score is real internal contradiction or visible cost: Maris never wavers, doubts, or strains under pressure, so her endurance is tasteful but a bit too untroubled. The relationship shifts from fear to respect, but that shift is one-directional and gentle rather than crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is distinct and specific—a grief-struck chess coach whose worldview is filtered through games, silence, and “humble rebellions.” His motivation (sister’s loss, desire to give others “second thoughts”) is clear and coherently drives his present actions. However, his internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete in-scene dilemma where contradictory impulses pull him in opposite directions. The final decision to leave with the magnets feels emotionally right but not heavily contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirien is clearly sketched as someone who has learned to be small and ghostlike, and her curiosity toward the scrimshaw plus buried longing for her mother effectively motivate her choices. The embodied details (bare feet on wet docks, the scrimshaw vibrating) give her interiority texture even without explicit introspection. However, her internal conflict at the island—between remaining attached to the old world and following her mother’s path—never fully sharpens into a difficult, contradictory choice. The change at the end feels real but a bit too frictionless, with limited sense of what she’s sacrificing beyond an abstract “world’s cruelty.”

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a grief-numbed, ritual-bound widower; his masklike affect, the tea eulogies, and his fixation on the bouquet and whittling all feel particular and credible. The motivation “to cultivate lightness in grief” is clear and consistent, and the dream of his wife adds a strong, wounding beat of interiority. However, his internal conflict (rebellious grief vs. mandated happiness) remains more stated than pressure-tested, with limited on-page contradiction in real time. The ending reads as an earned endurance rather than a decisive shift, solid but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s motivation and sensibility are clear and particular—an artist drawn to dangerous beauty and permeability of meaning. Her aesthetic drive is dramatized in how she interacts with the quartz and “paraphrases” the world. However, internal conflict is muted; she feels the elders’ warnings but never truly hesitates, so contradictory impulses are underplayed. The closing shift (“not as a poet, but as someone who had walked through the poem”) is earned but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s frustration, envy of Mara, and yearning for a different way of seeing are clear and consistent, and his final willingness to paint “what he feels” is credibly motivated. However, his internal conflict stays relatively gentle; we’re told he’s long tormented by his limitations, but we don’t see him pushed into a truly pressured or contradictory choice. Liora and Mara are effective but thinly sketched archetypes (mystical broker, nurturing craftswoman) who don’t themselves undergo change. The cost of Elias’s shift—what he’s giving up in terms of precision or identity—is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (“to discover the texture of connection”) is specific and consistently dramatized through his ritual with the bells and his tactile engagement with the lamp. His interiority feels particular—an almost tactile obsession with sound and fracture—rather than generic. The shift from wanting to “recreate the past” to listening to “the cracks” grounds an earned internal change. Internal contradiction under pressure could be sharper, but for this length the arc is credible and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief, craft, and isolation are sharply drawn, and his small but decisive shift at the end (pressing the stencil to his wrist, choosing to “wear the grief, not drown in it”) feels earned by what we’ve seen. His interiority is specific (mourning rings, “curtains of intention,” Liora’s tools) rather than generic sorrow. The main limitation is that his internal conflict during the citywide chase is more observed than actively wrestled with on the page, so contradictory impulses under pressure stay somewhat muted. Still, for this length, his motivation and arc are clear, particular, and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira feels specific and grounded: the onyx ink, the tape-as-serpent, and her geologist-like approach to stories all build a coherent, particular psyche. Her curiosity and pattern-obsession clearly motivate her to engage with the strange deck and text back. Internal conflict is present but fairly low-grade—she hesitates at the phone, but the cost of replying vs. not replying is sketched more conceptually than viscerally. A bit more embodied contradiction under that final choice would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to purify the archive while being irresistibly drawn to forbidden knowledge—is clear, consistent, and tied to her professional identity. Her emotional life is embodied in concrete perceptions (dust, moss, texts) and the pull of the archive feels character-specific rather than generic. However, her internal conflict around letting go versus clinging to the past is resolved very quickly once Kael appears, with minimal on-page struggle. Kael himself is more a thematic device than a fully pressured character, which slightly flattens the relational crucible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to prove the river’s lingering shadow and thus salvage a form of hope—is clear, consistent, and rooted in the particularities of his perception and patience. His “softly deliberate” nature informs his choices (watching, comparing footage, not rushing to touch the stone once it rolls), though internal conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in competing impulses. The life-long cost is gestured at (“He had spent his life chasing this moment”) but not deeply felt in scene, keeping the arc a bit muted. Still, the quiet shift from preservation-as-freezing to preservation-as-flow is earned by the preceding obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and credible: the conservationist whose gentleness enabled a betrayal feels psychologically grounded, and his small, concrete choices at the table (adhesive vs. tweezers, reconstruct vs. trim) reveal his values. The link between his professional care and emotional naiveté is sharp. A few lines edge into theme-summarizing (“Now, that belief felt as delicate as the chameleon’s broken tail”), slightly flattening the conflict. Overall, his shift toward a harder, more self-protective compassion feels earned and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and consistent: the mix of seeking quiet yet following the ominous tunnel and ignoring the moss’s warning makes him feel like a real person under pressure. His plant-telepathy, scar-awareness, and need for “closure” knit into a coherent interiority rather than a list of traits. The final shift—accepting the displaced miracle and feeling his scars stop aching—feels earned, if somewhat gently priced. A bit more dramatized inner conflict at the decision to continue past the moss could deepen the sense of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (to locate the stored, unused love and the lost tune) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is vivid and particular (“feel the weight of the unsaid”). Her competence in psychometry and comfort with liminal spaces feel character-specific rather than generic mystic traits. Internal contradiction is lighter—she rarely seems genuinely torn, mostly serenely committed—so the emotional cost of her pursuit could deepen. The final choice to lean into the burning vision and promise “I’ll bring the tune back” feels earned but not sharply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motive—to free her blocked creativity—is clear and consistent, and her interiority is sensibly tied to sensory impressions of the sky and stars. However, her emotional journey is fairly one-note (wistful blockage → sudden release) without much on-page contradiction or resistance; the breakthrough feels smooth rather than hard-won. The line “not by forcing it, but by letting go” gestures at complexity, but the struggle is mostly summarized instead of dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Still, for a brief lyric piece, her reactions and final renunciation of the instrument track cleanly with what we know of her.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is crisply sketched as the stoic, dreamless guard whose curiosity and faint disquiet finally push him to engage with the dune and the clock. However, his internal conflict is thin: we don’t see a strong push-pull between duty, fear, desire, and disbelief in the key beats. The final shift from “guarding cargo” to “guarding the sparks” feels more assigned than earned through his specific contradictions or prior misbeliefs. Embodied emotion is present but light, so the transformation lands more as concept than as character necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philosopher’s motivation—answering the call of the “wild frontier” of his mind—is clear and consistent, and his choices (taking the gear, listening to the wind, stepping forward at the end) align with it. However, his interiority remains generalized and a bit abstract; we rarely see contradictory impulses or sharply embodied emotion under pressure. The sixth sense and the fear/attraction to chaos are stated more than dramatized in concrete, character-specific ways. As a result, the final acceptance of chaos feels believable but not deeply earned through layered internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira has a clear history and desire, and the ticket-punch backstory credibly motivates her search for courage, but her inner conflict is sketched more than dramatized. We’re told she waited for permission and that “something inside her had cracked,” yet we rarely see contradictory impulses in real-time as she approaches the cove. Elias is a functional, wise-guide presence with a few nice touches (steady hands, humming) but limited depth. The final shift—“For the first time in years, she didn’t feel like a passenger”—is earned enough, though the cost of that change is lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation (understanding the cost of safety), a textured history (accident, nerve regeneration, lost voice), and a consistent perceptual style that feels character-bound. His final refusal to accept “necessary” silence is credibly earned. Internal contradiction (safety vs truth) is present but remains more implied than viscerally dramatized in on-page micro-choices. Madame Veyra functions effectively as an institutional foil, though she leans a bit archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is vividly sketched as a small-bodied but morally and intellectually formidable figure, and her scholar/thief ambiguity is effective. Her motivation—to expose the pretender by recovering erased truth—is clear and consistently drives her actions. However, her interiority is largely one-note resolve; we see little contradictory impulse or emotional cost beyond purpose-driven determination. The ending choice to claim the rune and act feels earned, but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity, unease, and persistence are clearly sketched through concrete behavior (tapping, combing records, following the pattern), and her motivation to recover erased reef histories feels organic. However, she experiences little visible internal contradiction under pressure—her drive never truly conflicts with fear, fatigue, or doubt—so the arc reads more as steady pursuit than pressured change. The final stance (“And she would”) is conceptually satisfying but carries limited on-page cost. A bit more friction between what she wants and what it demands of her would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her relationship to the glasses, the rebellion, and solitude all feel particular rather than generic. Motivation is clear (seeking meaning and responding to the hum), and her decision to approach and touch the stone is well rooted. Internal contradiction exists (caution vs compulsion, disillusionment vs emergent hope) but is lightly sketched rather than fully dramatized under pressure. The final turn toward hope is emotionally earned but not tied to a sharply defined cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is vivid and particular—earth-bound, stubborn, with a long history of resisting authority—and her choice to unseal the embryo tracks cleanly with those traits. Her plant-listening and defiance of the Council feel organically rooted rather than grafted on. However, her internal conflict is underplayed: once she deciphers the kite, she moves from doubt to certainty with little on-page contradiction or real hesitation. The relationship with Lina adds tenderness but isn’t fully used as a crucible for harder emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s trauma, disbelief in “healing,” and gradual movement toward endurance are rendered through concrete, embodied beats (the freeze at the drone hum, the tending of cuttings, burying the photograph) rather than labels. Mira is sketched economically but distinctly as a realist-optimist mentor, and her stance exerts steady pressure without sentimentality. The final earned stasis—Lena’s steady, uncelebratory tending—feels like a credible, costly change. The only slight weakness is a touch of authorial shorthand in sentences like “Mira’s motivation had always been…” which tell what the scene could fully show.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, self-laceration, and compulsion to “descend into the necessary darkness” are specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (erasing the woman, redesigning the cards, submitting to the walls) feel motivated. The internal conflict between wanting obliteration and seeking meaning is present, though it could be sharpened into more explicit on-page contradiction rather than mostly rhetorical framing. His emotional life is largely embodied via interaction with objects rather than named feelings, which works well. The final stance—choosing to draw the ache rather than the lost woman—reads as an earned, costly reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched—albino tracker, drawn to the unnatural, with a believable, long-standing obsession with time under crisis. His micro-choices (investigating the drone, running toward the scream, grabbing the ink-figure) all align with that drive and feel motivated. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see him truly torn between alternatives, and “consciously wild” is stated rather than embodied with a concrete tradeoff. The mother and child function mostly as props for the central mystery, so relationships are not yet a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—shifting from passive preservation to active provocation—is clear, grounded in his history with Seraphine and the Order, and it credibly drives the final act of planting the letter. Interiority is textured (“admiration was just another form of silence”), and his fear of silence versus fear of consequence gives him a specific contradiction. However, the internal conflict remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in agonized micro-choices; he never seriously wavers or considers alternatives on the page. The closing renunciation (walking away, not reading or destroying the letter) feels earned but its emotional cost is only lightly sketched rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s pacifist, pattern-seeing disposition is clear and grounded in specific behaviors, and her relationship with her father feels textured despite minimal wordcount. The micro-choice to sheathe the knife instead of draw it is a strong character-revealing beat. Her father is more archetypal but still carries a credible mix of ruthlessness and buried sentiment. The final refusal of the bounty grows organically from who both of them are, though a bit more visible internal conflict in Liora at his entrance could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive—catching the goddess’s echo—clearly drives the piece and aligns with his established cool-headed, obsessive nature, and his small choice to reject the garden’s sorrow (“Too much”) in favor of the echo shows discernment under pressure. However, his interior conflict is relatively mild; we don’t see truly contradictory impulses grinding against each other, nor a sharply felt cost for success. The suggestion that “perhaps it had caught him” hints at a deeper transformation but remains more conceptual than embodied. Overall, he feels specific and coherent, but the emotional stakes of his change could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s psychology is sharply etched: the ink-and-stars upbringing, the accusatory memory of her father’s handwriting, and her shift from weary cynicism to deliberate action all feel particular and earned. Her observational habits translate credibly into investigative choices (the letters, the insistence on original autopsy notes). Internal contradiction—grief, bitterness, and a cool rational method—does surface, though it could be pushed harder under peak pressure. The final choice to step into danger reads motivated rather than epiphanic or convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s guilt, avoidance, and compulsion to mark his body as a ledger are concrete and consistent, with the car accident and sister’s letters giving his present choices clear roots. His decision to mix amber into the ink and keep tattooing under pressure feels motivated and revealing. Internal conflict (wanting silence vs. submitting to being “tethered” to the past) is present, though not always dramatized in simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page. The emotional progression is convincing but leans slightly toward tidy catharsis at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific (the need to “discover meaning in the mess,” her sensitivity to bodies and mist), and her frustration with the mandala gives her interiority texture. Her emotional responses feel embodied and congruent with her role as an artist. The relationship with Maren provides a nice crucible for her worldview but is only lightly stressed. Internal contradiction (need for control vs need to surrender/listen) is present but could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora is sharply etched: “gentle radical,” retrocognitively trapped, rebuilding what another destroyed. Her motivation—using the past as both weight and weapon—feeds directly into her moral dilemma over Amira’s name. The internal conflict between vengeance and “aberrant mercy” is credible and sustained but could show a few more messy, contradictory impulses in-scene rather than via exposition. The final choice to keep the name is well earned by prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias and Liora are distinct and vivid, with Liora’s longing for an encore clearly motivating her and shaping the final choice to take his hand. Elias’s motive—offering “hope” via the garden—is plausible but under-explored; we don’t see much contradiction or cost in him, only competence and quiet devotion. The relationship has history and texture (child Elias hiding after hours, her secret), but their dynamic under pressure stays relatively straightforward. The ending choice feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s mix of tactile skepticism and yearning for explanation (“hug you tightly while whispering, ‘Prove it.’”) is specific and drives her decision to experiment rather than flee. Her emotional life is embodied (palming her sternum, the geode in her pocket), and her shift from wanting to undo the pill to “a way to live with it” feels earned. Internal contradiction (skeptic vs emergent believer) could cut sharper under more pressure, and Eli remains more prop than crucible. The relationship doesn’t quite force a difficult choice or show a real shift between them.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eira’s curiosity, inherited role, and embodied sensitivity (“the caves were feeling her back”) give her a distinctive inner life, and her fear/attraction to the presence feels credible. The fossil as a transitional object personalizes her attachment to the lost world. However, the pivotal acceptance of becoming a vessel happens very quickly, with limited dramatized resistance or internal contradiction in the moment. A slightly deeper clash between self-preservation and surrender at the climax would better earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s role, sensibility, and beliefs are specific and coherent—the “hourglass turner” who trusts the weight of objects over abstract prophecy is a strong, character-particular frame. Her motivation to “spin the prophecy into raw possibility” feels organic and is paid off at the end. However, internal contradiction and on-page struggle are muted; she moves through the story with near-perfect composure, so the final stance doesn’t feel wrestled-for so much as affirmed. A touch more embodied stress or competing impulse at the climax would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, self-loathing, and cautious professionalism are rendered with specific, embodied details (the scar, the pillbox carried for three years). His motivation—to seek some form of atonement or at least proof of courage—is clear and consistent, and the final choice to take the file and leave the pillbox feels earned. The inner conflict between “prudently daring” and true risk is present but occasionally surfaced in slightly aphoristic, on‑the‑nose phrasing. I would like one or two more concrete, idiosyncratic flashes of personality beyond his role as damaged spy seeking redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and consistent: the rope work, the needle, and his old-man body ("knees popping like distant thunder") all align with his patient, duty-bound temperament. His motivation and history with his wife are clear and textured, though the line "His motivation had always been simple: to distill complexity into essence" skews a bit abstract/essayistic. Internal conflict is muted rather than sharply contradictory, but the closing shift from tension to gratitude/serenity reads as an earned, quiet endurance. For a piece this short and meditative, the character arc feels credible if modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ren’s characterization is specific and textured—the potter background, his attraction to stubborn pockets of life, and his near-reverent handling of clay and lantern all cohere. Motivation (drawn to places that refuse to die) is clear and drives his presence and actions. However, internal contradiction and on-page emotional struggle are muted; he largely glides through realization without visible cost or resistance. The final shift in understanding is credible but feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is cleanly sketched as a solitary, gentle man whose attachment to the garden and inherited tools feels specific and grounded, and Lila’s quiet grief reads as credible. His decision to give up the last link to his father is motivated and lands as a meaningful, if quiet, cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild—he’s sad and hopeful, cautious yet generous, without a truly sharp conflict. The relationship dynamic is nicely understated but could withstand a little more friction or misalignment to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—coexisting with the past without being consumed by it—is clear and consistently embodied through her relationship to the sundial and the library. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (“brittle, as if the weight of a thousand lives had settled into her bones”), but her emotional conflict rarely sharpens into live contradictions on the page. The curator’s warning is underused as a pressure source and never really tests her stance. The final sense of purpose feels a bit tidy, with limited sense of ongoing cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation—seeking a pattern to understand her own secrets after a life of ghostwriting others’ love letters—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. Her internal change from searching for an external pattern to recognizing the “thread” in herself feels earned, if slightly neat. The keeper and the artist are somewhat archetypal, but they function cleanly as pressure points and mirrors rather than mere mouthpieces. Emotional states are shown through concrete engagement with objects (nest, twig, letter) rather than abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect the community by using her technical skill against the tricksters—and her competence under pressure feels grounded. We get some concrete embodiment (trembling fingers, fogging glass) and a credible mix of fear and resolve, but her internal conflict remains fairly simple and unlayered. Voss functions effectively as a skeptical foil whose status shifts into reluctant awe, though he never quite escapes type. The final “cautiously hopeful” stance is earned but could carry more visible personal cost or contradiction to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s fear and determination are clearly drawn—his claustrophobia is well embodied at the start, and his dogged need “to know how to fix it” is credible. Internal contradiction (terror vs curiosity) is present but under-exploited at the key choice; he grabs the compass with little visible struggle. The mysterious figure is intriguing but thin, functioning more as a concept-delivery device than a character. The closing shift (fear forgotten in the face of cosmic understanding) is plausible but could carry more emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and particular—face blindness, tactile memory, and her role as an artist who “draws the dead” all feel integrated and consistent, and her final commitment to drawing Liora as a person rather than just a victim is motivated. Her interiority is concrete (fogging spectacles, satin against skin), though her emotional conflict stays relatively tidy and rational rather than truly torn. The sibling figure is thinly sketched and functions more as a delivery system for information and theme than as a fully pressuring presence. Still, Elara’s values and methods clearly shape her choices, giving the piece a credible, if quiet, internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation (honor Elias, uncover the truth) is clear and consistent, and her “nervous confidence” feels particular rather than generic. Her interiority around the nail and the journals is vivid and embodied (“nervous confidence draining into spongey dread”). The main limitation is that her internal conflict at the end (honoring bravery vs. embracing a more ambiguous mission of being “sent”) is suggested rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices. The final choice is poised rather than enacted, which slightly softens the felt cost of her characterization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena is vivid, particular, and emotionally legible; her history with small, improbable acts (driftwood boats, playing for ghosts) fits cleanly with her present choices. Motivation is clear and consistent, and the hitchhiker/flake deepen her pattern of attending to traces. What’s missing at this tier is real contradiction under pressure—her decision to continue down the road is in character but not meaningfully contested or costly. The result is strong, textured characterization that stops short of a truly incisive crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn through his history with his father, his fixation on foreign bills, and his desire to break inherited cycles, and the father’s presence is vivid despite being off-page. His calm, observational stance contrasts with his father’s weaponized composure in a way that feels specific and earned. The internal shift at the end—from feeling trapped in circles to seeing spirals—is credibly motivated by what he notices and recalls in the scene. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a touch more friction between his nostalgia for his father and his rejection of the man’s path could deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—a sensitive, slightly ascetic observer whose identity as “lucid dream chronicler” and healer with words coheres with his actions and realizations. His motivation (to decode the inscriptions and relieve others’ burdens) is consistent and understandable. However, his internal conflict is relatively mild: there’s little sense of genuine risk or competing impulses when he shifts from decoding alone to sharing the message. The final decision feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s guilt, duty to the Circle, and fear of her own truth interlock convincingly, and her choice to accept the plant’s pain and confess feels well-motivated. Interiority is specific and embodied (“her boots sinking into the frost-rimed mud,” scars “like rivers of old battles”), not generic angst. The internal contradiction—protector of the forest who let people die and hides that fact—is clear and active in the scene. A slightly tighter dramatization of her hesitation at the moment of confession could elevate the emotional cost even further.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is reasonably specific—the scar, the tether to the glade, and his refusal to look away distinguish him from a generic seer. His motivation to answer the call and remake the covenant is clear, and his final belief in “Together” reads as a modest but real shift. However, internal conflict stays largely abstract; fear and compulsion are stated but not really dramatized in difficult on-page choices. The woman remains mostly an archetypal figure, so the relationship doesn’t become a crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation (save her brother / atone for her hesitation) is clear and consistent, and the internal conflict over surrendering her defining memory is sharply rendered. Embodied emotion is strong (“phantom weight of his fingers”), and her final choice feels earned with visible cost. The Patchwork Girl epithet and “stitching scraps of cloth over the holes in her soul” give her a distinct psychology. The stranger is more archetypal than individuated but functions cleanly as pressure, not a flaw at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    Jake is sharply sketched—competent, bitter, and self-protective—and his appraiser’s eye usefully reveals character (“Facts were the difference between a 1923 Gibson L-1 and a 1930s knockoff”). His coping strategy and shame around the bus crash are clear and consistent, and his pull toward the pit feels motivated. Internal contradiction is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-moment, and the relationship with Lena turns quickly from shock to easy rapport, leaving their shared history under-pressured for this to feel fully transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s professional focus, skepticism about “souls,” and “kindly methodical” temperament come through cleanly, and her actions all align with that psychology. However, her inner conflict is mild: belief in physics vs. the arboreal spirituality never truly tear at her in-scene, so her shift at the end feels more like a gentle confirmation than a pressured transformation. The lack of a sharp, embodied cost (she risks little beyond disappointment) keeps the characterization from fully igniting. The most compelling moment is her stinging-eyed smile at “Not lost. Only changed,” which crystallizes a believable but low-intensity arc.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—“to preserve wonder in routine”—is clear and consistently embodied in his actions as he tends the atrium and chooses to repurpose the creel. The internal tension between dutiful cataloger and restless smelter of the old into new is present but remains low-pressure and largely untested. His hybrid nature (brass and bone) enriches his sensibility but doesn’t generate concrete internal conflict beyond quiet melancholy. The final choice to send the books away is emotionally coherent, though the personal cost is understated rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The inspector’s interiority is clear and consistent, with the professional role rubbing against a buried personal fear (“I’m afraid of being forgotten”). Her choices—using the pearl, engaging each confession, finally crowning herself—track plausibly with that mix of duty and vulnerability. However, she remains somewhat archetypal; we get little that feels biographically specific beyond the grandmother’s pearl. The final realization is earned but could cut deeper if prior beats hinted more concretely at her history or prior inspections.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s guilt, self-appointed role as “truth-seeking river chronicler,” and choice to stop medication create a nuanced, embodied interiority with credible contradictions (self-punishment vs need for steady hands and clarity). Her micro-choices—treating the bathroom as an archive, obsessively mapping past errors, choosing to walk toward the river—are all motivated by that guilt. The past drowning shapes every present perception without being over-explained. The ending stance shift (not looking for forgiveness but a way to live with truth) feels earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dreamer’s motives are clear (answering the first letter, seeking the library, carrying the cipher and watch), and her interiority is specific enough to feel like a real mind. However, her internal conflict is muted—she rarely seems genuinely torn or under pressure, so her final liberation (“set her free”) feels more declared than hard-won. The contradictory impulses implied by “cautious exuberance” could be dramatized more directly in concrete micro-choices. The result is strong but not yet at a peak-literary level of complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—testing her own dream against her father’s empire—is clear, and her internal tension between obligation and desire runs through the whole piece. Embodied details (cold gloves, shaking hands, numb fingers) anchor her emotions rather than generic labels. The relationship with her father is legible in a few strokes, but he reads more as a functional symbol of “empire” than as a fully particularized person, which slightly flattens the crucible. Her ultimate choice to play the violin and accept being the “fracture” feels earned but could carry more explicit, contradictory hesitation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s vocation and worldview are clear and particular, and her actions (seeking the grotto, using the emerald) align cleanly with that ethos. However, she faces little genuine inner conflict or contradictory impulse in scene; her stance toward death and beauty feels settled from the start. The emotional beats (anxious watchfulness, then relief, then renewed commitment) are believable but not especially complex. The closing commitment to “return, again and again” is earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is specific and credible: an aging caretaker whose body and mind are both present on the page, with a clear contradiction between having forgiven and still lacking contentment. Her micro-choices—climbing despite age, deciding the shell is a sign, entering the grotto, surrendering the hairpin—track cleanly with that interiority. The main limitation is that the final peace arrives somewhat quickly and tidily once the pool-vision appears, with little resistance or backsliding dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a “moral auditor” whose blend of cynicism and susceptibility to others’ desperation feels specific and credible, and Veyra’s fragility under the claim “I didn’t kill her” lands. Interiority is concrete (the mirror shard, the coat, the cloak of doubt) and showcases genuine ambivalence, not cleanly resolved. The relationship dynamic—Veyra asking for judgment, Elias discovering he’s really being asked for understanding—functions well as a crucible. The only limitation is that the cost of Elias’s final stance shift remains conceptually implied rather than dramatized in a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to confront her fear and replicate/understand her grandmother’s vanishing—is clear, specific, and consistently embedded in her perceptions and choices. The internal contradiction between scientist and believer, fear and desire, is well dramatized through the ritual rather than merely labeled. Her final shift from “Dr. Voss” to “Elara” and acceptance of presence over reversal feels earned by the groundwork. The main limitation is that the emotional cost of this change is gestured at more than fully inhabited in embodied detail at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive—to master the navigators’ art—is clear and carries consistently through his choices (watching the birds, trusting the relics, entering the chamber). Interiority is concrete and particular (“his resolve weathered but unbroken”), with a believable patience and reverence. The final acceptance of “wander[ing] its echoes forever” feels earned but the internal conflict is relatively mild—there’s little sense of competing impulses or real reluctance. That lack of sharper contradiction keeps the character short of top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s core motivation (shame-ridden “underachiever” hoping for a glimpse of the divine) is clear and drives his choices, and his small final act with the flower feels earned by the prior journey. Interiority is concrete enough—his numb fingers, mentor’s sigh, and quiet desperation—but still somewhat archetypal rather than deeply particular. The internal conflict between self-contempt and stubborn hope is present but not fully dramatized in scene; the fountain epiphany comes a bit easily. The line “You’re not an underachiever… You’re a slow learner” nudges toward tidy reassurance rather than a more conflicted, character-specific insight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias has a clear professional identity and a muted, believable loneliness, and his small choices (going to the Marigold, following the woman, giving up the tag) track. However, the supposed core flaw — “the truth you’ve been hiding behind” — is never concretely dramatized, so his late realization feels more bestowed than earned. His interiority stays fairly generic (prickle of skin, quickened pulse) rather than idiosyncratic. The relationship with the woman hints at shared ache and status shift but doesn’t quite become a crucible that forces a specific, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior life is specific and coherent, with a clear evolution from certainty-seeking acolyte to someone who chooses to endure and listen instead. Concrete behaviors (fingering the coins, casting lots, closing his fist on them) track his shifting stance. The contradiction between his old drive for “alignment” and his emerging acceptance of misalignment plays credibly in scene rather than as a single flip. The cost—relinquishing the comfort of a clear, teleological purpose—is implicit but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and textured—a skeletal, quasi-reaper who’s weary, compelled by memory, and quietly defiant of his own role. His motivation (“to give names to nameless fears”) is clear and paid off in the naming ritual. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; he moves from burden to release with little real resistance or risk, so his shift feels more like completion than a hard-won change. Adding a sharper tension between his reaper-duty and this act of remembrance would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a “lukewarm mage” with modest abilities and earnest, slightly absurd ambition, and his limitation with fire directly shapes his choice to work with dripping water instead. His motivation—“to right a cosmic imbalance”—is clear and consistently embodied in patient, methodical behavior. Internal contradiction is present (insecure, small magic vs. grand, almost delusional goal) but stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in live moments of doubt or temptation. The closing realization about rebuilding vs. perfection is earned but could carry more visible personal cost or inner friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, loyalty to his father’s narrative, and emerging doubt cohere into a believable, pressurized inner life. The burn-or-carry choice at the end is clearly motivated by the week-long investigation and what the photos reveal. Contradictory impulses—duty to “progress” versus obligation to the forgotten—are present but could be embodied more viscerally in the peak decision. A slight tilt toward abstract language (“rising tide of forgetting,” “spin them into shared meaning”) mutes some of the messier human texture that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s core contradiction—an alchemist of logic drawn helplessly toward wonder—is clear and consistent, with the fire experiment and the crystal both revealing how control and awe war inside her. Her motivation (to understand rather than dominate magic) guides every beat and cleanly earns the final renunciation of control. However, the internal struggle resolves a bit too smoothly into insight, with limited on-page resistance or irrational backsliding at the decisive moment. The “secretly sentimental” revelation feels more told than dramatized, softening the sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched through his pattern-focused perception, history as a sky-watcher, and the talismanic relationship to the buckle. Motivation and flaw (shaken self-trust) are clear and consistently dramatized rather than labeled. However, internal conflict remains relatively binary—fear vs. determination—without a more complex contradiction or a sharper, costly renunciation at the end. The final choice to keep climbing is credible but not deeply reconfigured beyond “endure and proceed.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s numbness, yearning to feel, and self-protective “I’m broken” narrative are consistently dramatized through his micro-choices in the fight, and Veyra’s role as a ruthless but invested mentor is clear in how she withholds the jar and pushes him physically. His internal contradiction—desiring sensation while clinging to the safety of numbness—is legible and paid off in the final step into the clouds. The main weakness is that Veyra skews a bit archetypal and some of her insight veers toward explicit aphorism rather than fully character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena is specific—a lateral-thinking escape room designer with a buried family history around corpse flowers—and her choices (planting, hiding, redesigning the room, preparing for “them”) clearly arise from that temperament. Her curiosity versus caution tension is present but underdeveloped; she rarely feels genuinely conflicted, even when warned “They will try to take it from you.” Emotional beats lean on a few familiar gestures (“her breath caught,” “hands shook”) where sharper, more idiosyncratic embodiment could deepen her. The courier remains a thin instrument rather than a true pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn—former maestro turned clandestine healer of silence—with motives that are clear and consistent from first line to last. His embodied emotion (“hands trembled,” reluctance to be seen) lands, and his history with the family (police, then weeping, now listening) nicely layers his persistence. However, his internal contradictions are only lightly touched (he “had not come here to be seen,” but the cost of being seen isn’t deeply dramatized beyond a hitch of breath). The girl and mother are credible but sketched, functioning more as receivers of his act than full counter-pressures on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and coherent—her "dimensional homesickness" and unease with the pendant create a distinct psyche. Her motivation (seeking answers vs learning to live with uncertainty) is clear and the final shift away from waiting feels earned. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened with one or two more pressured, contradictory impulses in scene rather than mostly articulated in narration.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched as obsessive, exhausted, and self-repressing, with the mentor’s crozier and the ledger concretizing his history and despair. His pivot from perfectionism to embracing “creative destruction” feels psychologically coherent with his accumulated failures. However, the internal conflict resolves a bit cleanly—once “the penny drops,” contradictory impulses don’t significantly pull against his final choice, so the cost is more implied than lived through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s overarching motive is clear and specific, and her calm, methodical behavior under cosmic pressure is consistent with that motive. However, her interiority remains relatively one-note—pure seeker without much contradiction or blind spot—and we rarely see genuine struggle beyond awe. The key realization about beginnings as states rather than moments feels earned but arrives with little internal resistance on the page, softening the sense of cost. The piece would benefit from at least one concrete hesitation, fear, or competing attachment to complicate her final transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is cleanly drawn—ardent, gently superstitious, and quietly devoted—with concrete habits (the hourglass, humming shanties) that feel particular. His resilience under weird pressure fits his stated trait, and his choice to “listen to the patterns” rather than panic is motivated. What’s missing at this tier is any real internal contradiction or visible cost; he never wavers or pays much for his stance. Veyra is sketched efficiently but remains largely functional rather than a crucible for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and vocation as a “fever dream architect” give him a distinct interior lens and plausible motives for touching the thread and following it. His calm acceptance of escalating unreality is interesting but under-explored as conflict—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine fear. Emotion is often described via concepts (“rational enchantment”) rather than sharply embodied contradictions. The final shift—truly feeling the “texture of connection”—is supported by prior setup but lands more as fulfillment than costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirien’s motivation and professional identity are clear and consistent, and her curiosity under pressure feels grounded in the worldbuilding. However, we mostly see her in “instructor/visionary” mode; there’s limited contradictory impulse beyond mild wariness, and very little embodied emotion in high-stakes moments (e.g., when the alien ship descends). Tael works more as a foil than as a true relational crucible, applying only light resistance. The final commitment to “expand” is thematically earned but carries minimal visible personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena is clearly motivated by a blend of professional obligation, personal curiosity, and a stubborn protectiveness; details like the cracked hearing aid and her self-description as “not brave—just persistently curious” give her specificity. Her actions track with those motives, especially in ignoring Elias’s warning. Internal contradiction (fear vs drive) is present but somewhat underplayed; she moves into danger with little visible hesitation. Elias is lightly but effectively sketched as a tragic, warning figure, though their relationship dynamic could carry more tension.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—returning the codex to the lost researchers and accepting that “no one would remember to thank him”—is clear and consistent, and his final choice to stay aligns with that drive. Claustrophobia, guilt, and duty are present but rarely in direct contradiction on the page, so inner conflict feels implied more than dramatized. The brief interaction with Liora (“You came back”) nicely crystallizes his role but doesn’t add much relational complexity. Strong, but not yet at the level of layered, contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn through specific, idiosyncratic details—the death certificate error, the teacup shard, the habitual heartbeat counting—so his survivor’s guilt feels particular rather than generic. His inner conflict between feeling undeserving of life and seeking meaning in it is clear and textured. The closing shift toward accepting himself as “the space between” his mistakes is modest but earned. The main limitation is that his on-page choices under pressure are few; he mostly reflects and receives.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to translate texture/echoes into a tangible form) is clear, consistent, and rooted in her skepticism of curses and belief in patterns. Her interiority is particular enough—she thinks in terms of texture, pattern, and birds—but conflict is relatively low: she never seriously wavers or confronts the hinted madness risk. The final “change” is mainly external (she succeeds) and conceptual, with little felt personal cost or internal reconfiguration. Strong, but not yet at the level of deeply contradictory impulses or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession with the phenomenon and his weary bitterness feel specific and grounded in details like “cryptid researcher” and the decade of “chasing shadows.” His choice to reject Maren’s warning and lean into the phone’s invitation is psychologically plausible, though the exact emotional hinge of that decision could be shaded with a bit more internal contradiction on the page. Maren is effective as a rooted, wary counterpart but remains close to archetype (the knowing herbalist/guardian of the threshold). The metamorphosis choice is motivated, but its personal cost to Elias-as-individual (beyond generic humanity) could be more sharply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s duty, fatigue, and hunger for something beyond the bridge are clearly rendered, and her choice to risk the orchard for a different kind of beauty feels motivated by the locust shell’s revelation. However, interior conflict is often summarized in abstract terms (“The gap between knowing and understanding had always been her prison”) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses in scene. Her pivot from dutiful containment to active rebellion happens quickly and with relatively little felt struggle on the page. The child reads as a functional foil rather than a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jace is sharply sketched: a relic of bureaucracy whose refusal to discard undeliverable letters and his choice to help Mira both feel rooted in his melancholy stubbornness. His interiority is concrete (the letters pressing “like a secret he couldn’t deliver”), and the decision to keep carrying both letters and storm at the end is an earned endurance rather than a revelation. Mira is thinner but still distinct in posture, age, and defiance. The internal conflict—resenting a dead system yet clinging to its remnants—could be pushed harder at the climax to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly sketched—his silence, craft, and belief in “interpreting silence as possibility” feel particular and consistent, and his choices (singing, installing the halo) track with those traits. What’s thin for top-tier work is on-page conflict inside him: there’s little sense of risk or ambivalence as he leans into the magic. His emotional palette runs mostly on wonder and quiet longing, without a sharp contradictory impulse at the climax. The final shift toward “letting the music carry him home” is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is cleanly sketched—his odd hours, glasses, and belief in “analog memories” feel particular and coherent with his actions. His motivation to find “the place where stories lived” is stated and then enacted through his decision to follow the scarf. However, he never experiences genuine internal contradiction or visible cost; he moves from curiosity to discovery without a real test of values or fear. The woman remains largely a function or symbol rather than a fully realized counter-presence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s longing and quiet routine are clearly drawn, and his progression from passive dreamer to someone who leaves the island feels motivated and consistent. Interiority is present but relatively gentle—his contradictions (content librarian vs. restless seeker) are implied more than dramatized under pressure. The final choice to go to the farthest island shows a real, if understated, cost: abandoning his predictable life for uncertainty. The woman at the end is more an emblem than a character, but that suits the story’s focus and length.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    The locksmith’s interiority is clear and particular—his weariness, sense of duty, and understanding of “locks—literal or otherwise” give him texture beyond archetype. However, his conflict remains relatively soft: he notes that “this was different,” but we don’t see that difference test him with any real contradiction or cost. Elara is mostly an absence; her boldness and fear are summarized rather than dramatized, so the relationship never quite becomes a crucible. The final choice (“Tell it”) feels right but emotionally under-strained for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to fill the black hole in his memory and recover his sister) is clear and sustained, with concrete behaviors—meticulous note-taking, interviews, the return to the site—backing it up. His emotional life is embodied through sensory anchors (hum through bones, metallic tang of blood) more than abstract labels. Internal contradiction (curiosity vs. dread, guilt vs. amnesia) is present but underplayed, so his psyche feels textured but not deeply excavated. Liora is compelling but sketched, functioning more as an uncanny catalyst than a fully realized counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply realized: her self-chosen exile, backward walking, fixation on shadows, and guilt over a failed apprentice create a textured, contradictory interior. The motivation to avoid hurting another apprentice while still yearning to mentor is clear and consistently dramatized. Her micro-choice to let Mira imitate her and then to hand over the cup reads as an earned, costly opening. Mira is less deep but still functions credibly as pressure and foil rather than a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s role, history, and motive (“To preserve the color of wonder—that was why she had come”) are clear and particular, and her actions align with them. Her interiority is sensorial and embodied rather than labeled. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or live dilemma, so we don’t see her flaws or blind spots tested. The ending’s “weight of what she had done” is earned but low-cost and largely unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (haunted by the spirits, professional restorer, moral compulsion to “set them free”) is clear and consistent, and his hesitation before stabbing the mask shows credible internal conflict. His craft background and muscle memory with knots give him specificity beyond a generic occult protagonist. The Fisher King appears late but provides a sharp relational crucible and a direct counter-value (“Some things should stay buried”). The final choice feels earned, though the emotional cost to Elias in that last act could be shaded more distinctly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation—drawn to absences, edges, and silences—is clear, consistent, and tied to his occupation in a character-specific way. His methodical curiosity and empathy for what’s unspoken feel organic and drive his choices (studying the films, reopening the chapel). What’s missing at this tier is a more dramatized internal contradiction or visible emotional cost in the climax; his resolve never meaningfully wavers. The final realization (“the story was not yet finished”) is earned but lands more as quiet confirmation than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sketched with economical, specific strokes—“Death had been his first name…” is memorable and his competence and temperament track cleanly through the dive and the reading of Chen’s work. His quietly clinical curiosity motivates him, but his inner conflict is muted; we don’t feel a sharp tug between keeping and breaking the globe, just a largely untroubled acceptance. The relationship with Liora is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a live dynamic, so the choice to obey her “Let go” lands more as intellectual alignment than a wrenching decision. Still, his final act and reflection form a credible, earned shift in stance toward death and letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by the uncanny silence and by the ghost’s plea, and his choices (staying, playing, offering the bolt plate) are coherent and character-driven. Interiority is present but not deeply complex; he doesn’t really exhibit contradictory impulses or moral friction. The ghost’s motivation “To be remembered” is clean and affecting, if simple. The final endurance—remaining to play in the storm—reads as an earned stance, but the personal cost for Elias is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s curiosity, class position, and moral hesitation are cleanly established and drive her choices, especially her final renunciation of the diary and goggles. Her interiority is specific enough—like noticing others’ small tells—to feel individual rather than generic. The captain, though less explored, still registers as a complex figure whose grief and guardedness shape the scene. Emotional contradiction (curiosity vs. respect, intrusion vs. reverence) is present and believable, though not pushed to an extreme.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, obsession with the sky, and need to prove that “empty spaces remembered” are clear and particular, and his history (failed marriage, father’s disappearance) grounds his solitude. The father/Astraea reveal strongly motivates the final act, so the decisive change doesn’t feel arbitrary. However, we see little true in-scene vacillation or contradictory impulse at the moment of choice—he moves fairly cleanly from realization to renunciation. A bit more embodied struggle or a faltering step before he climbs the railing would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora is specific and vivid—her prosopagnosia and way of seeing bodies instead of faces are sharply rendered and tied to her vocation. Her motivation for seeking the sketch is coherent and rooted in her lifelong attempt to capture the sky. However, internal conflict at the crucial moment (keep or leave the drawing) is underdeveloped; she never seriously wavers, so the renunciation feels a touch too easy. More simultaneous pull between desire and reverence on the page would deepen the cost of her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is clearly and consistently motivated, and his micro-choices (sneaking out, studying the hopscotch board, copying the pattern, bringing it to Orlan) all align with that trait. The apprenticeship relationship is sketched efficiently and Orlan’s status and warmth land in a few lines. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or emotional cost—Elias rarely feels genuinely torn or under pressure. The final “change” is more recognition than a hard trade-off, so character growth feels promising rather than fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation and role, but his interiority stays largely at the level of stated desire and awe rather than conflicted, embodied emotion. His fear/avoidance of the hall of mirrors is mentioned but never really dramatized under pressure once he enters. The final realization about his role as a “bridge” feels more like a bestowed insight than the outcome of a hard, value-testing choice. Character remains appealingly sketched but not yet deep or contradictory enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motives and values are clear and consistent—her attachment to the orchard and to the refugees-turned-family grounds all her actions. However, her internal conflict (refusing to fade yet ultimately choosing to let go) is more asserted than dramatized; we get little moment-to-moment hesitation or contradiction. The villagers function as a mostly undifferentiated collective, with only the child and mother briefly individuated but not pressed into real relational conflict. The final renunciation reads emotionally plausible but somewhat too smooth for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s long-term motivation—to keep stretching the pre-apocalypse moment—is specific and credible, and his final shift from control to consolation (“Not to save the world, but to soothe it”) feels earned. The parallel between him and the puppet head deepens his interiority without over-explaining. Internal conflict (“What if you let it end?”) is present but largely summarized rather than dramatized in simultaneous, competing impulses, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s burden, reluctance, and workmanlike competence are cleanly established, and her guilt over past failures gives her a credible, non-heroic reason to act. The internal contradiction—no love for the lost vs. obligation to save some—nicely underpins her choice to help indirectly. However, her emotional texture in the climactic encounter is somewhat muted; we get less of how it feels to stand still while someone begs for help. A bit more embodied conflict at that peak moment would deepen her beyond a strong, serviceable outline.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lina’s interiority is specific and grounded in her vocation; the polymers/bonds mindset convincingly informs how she understands people and regret. Her flaw—control and rigidity—is clear and her shift toward flexibility and reconnection reads earned. However, internal conflict is mostly narrated rather than dramatized in live, contradictory impulses, especially regarding Mara. The emotional movement is persuasive but somewhat tidy and controlled, in keeping with her character but limiting volatility.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s desire “to find the place where stories begin” and to prove his own existence through the fading incision give him clear, specific motivation that’s thematically tied to the world. Interiority is textured and embodied (the coin’s warmth fading, breath fogging glass), though his internal conflict never quite sharpens into a genuinely pressured dilemma. The interaction with the woman exposes his uncertainty and naiveté, but their relationship doesn’t evolve beyond a single, slightly mannered exchange. His final stance shift is credible and earned, but the emotional cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s grief-shaped competence and Kael’s festering sorrow feel particular and embodied, especially via sensory links (“coating her tongue with the taste of salt and regret”). Her choice to touch him despite knowing the cost is a clean, motivated peak decision. The arc from her managed grief to shared carrying is believable, if a bit neat. Kael’s fast shift to clarity is slightly compressed but still earned by the intimacy of the shared memories.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s core motivation—transforming isolation into communal harmony—is clear and consistent, and her professional background as a choral librarian nicely colors her choices. However, she encounters almost no resistance, so we rarely see her under pressure making costly or conflicted decisions. Interiority stays largely thematic rather than contradictory or raw; she feels more like an emblem of empathy than a fully fraught person. The change at the end (from solitary fixer to community catalyst) is credible but emotionally easy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is rich and specific: “archeologist of abandoned dreams” and the fear of inheriting others’ unfinished work give her a distinct, coherent psychology. Her conflicting impulses—urge to modify vs. respect for fracture and memory—are clearly dramatized in the decision not to “fix” the mirror. Emotion is mostly embodied through interactions with the mirror and canyon rather than abstract labels. A small limitation is that “helix-minded precision” is more a flourish than a trait that reliably warps her choices across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her sensory/intellectual way of parsing the world feels individuated (“prism-minded archivist”). However, she faces little real resistance, and there’s almost no lived internal contradiction or cost; she moves from quest to self-crowning as “guardian” with minimal struggle. The emotional beats trend toward awe and realization rather than conflicted choice, which limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and way of perceiving the world are specific and consistent, and his motivation—to coax music from silence—is clear and embodied in his choices with the sculpture and insulator. Interiority is mostly concrete and character-particular (“tree-songs,” feeling resonance as a “ghost of sound”). The main limitation is a lack of sharp internal contradiction or real cost in his final stance; he never seems genuinely torn or at risk of giving up. The emotional progression is satisfying but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s exile, precision, and gentleness are clearly realized, and Lysara’s “translating silence” gives her a distinct texture. Their shared value of finding “beauty in the difficult” feels specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction and genuine struggle are muted; Elias’s final choice to stay comes with little visible ambivalence or cost. The relationship dynamic is warm but low-pressure, more mutual recognition than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and convincing—a solder-and-silence tinkerer, an "eclectic pacifist" whose methods (resonance over force) align with his worldview. His mixed feelings toward Liora ("He should have been angry. But…") give him some real interior contradiction, though that conflict is resolved very gently. Liora is sketched efficiently but remains more functionally wise than deeply human under pressure. The emotional cost of her disappearance and his years of hurt could be pushed further on the page to fully earn the reconciliation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s ambition, curiosity, and quiet defiance are clearly motivated and consistent, and her shift toward valuing “the waiting” is credibly rooted in what we’ve seen. However, her internal conflict stays relatively smooth—she never truly wavers or behaves badly under pressure—so the final insight feels more like an affirmation than a hard-won reversal. The relationship with Nara has a nice, legible status dynamic (elder vs. ambitious apprentice) but is only lightly tested. The cost of her choice is mostly projected into the future rather than felt on the page, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is cleanly motivated (experienced pilot, intent on reaching the “gathering of echoes” before inversion) and her competence feels grounded in specific habits and tools. Interiority is present but relatively simple; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond curiosity vs. danger. Her closing understanding of resilience is emotionally plausible and seeded, but arrives with little visible struggle or ambivalence on the page. The piece would benefit from one sharper internal conflict beat under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s professional lens and belief in “foresight in action” feel specific and consistent, and his shift from analyst to trapped subject is cleanly motivated. However, internal contradiction is relatively light; we don’t see much simultaneous push-pull beyond curiosity vs. unease. His emotional responses are mostly implied through action and bodily cues rather than richly conflicted interiority. The final repricing of foresight is earned but could cut deeper if his flaw or blind spot were more sharply dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eira’s motivation—to “certify wonder as essential” by freeing the song—is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her synesthetic way of processing sound gives her a specific inner life, but we see more focused determination than genuine contradiction or moral tension. The physical and emotional reactions to the chisel (crimson flares, trembling hands) give embodied stakes but stay within a narrow band of feeling. The change at the end (relief and quiet joy) is earned, yet the cost remains relatively light and unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt-ridden sense of inherited failure and his determination “to harvest insights from that failure” give him a clear, specific drive. His actions—following the driftwood, stepping through the tear, accepting the shadow-figure’s reframing—track cleanly with that motivation. However, his internal conflict remains relatively low-friction; he shifts from a sealing mindset to a weaving one with little resistance or self-contradiction on the page. The emotional cost of reconfiguring his role (and his father’s legacy) is only lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core drive (to mathematize emotion) and coping mechanism (borrowing personalities) are specific and consistent, and the interior texture of those shifts is vivid and character-particular. His passivity under peak pressure—he becomes a vessel more than an agent—softens the sense of a hard, costly choice at the end. The moment when he steals the woman’s voice and the workshop trembles nicely reveals a flaw (violating others) under stress. The final hollowness and quiet mind read as an earned but under-specified cost rather than a fully crystallized renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (shaking hands, the pressure of the pendant), and her attachment to the mentor gives her a credible emotional center. The main conflict—routine duty versus an invitation to threshold-level “wonder”—is clear, if a bit thematically tidy. Her final shift (letting herself be “delivered”) is earned but small-scale and largely conceptual. Some impulses (fear vs curiosity vs loyalty to the mentor) could be dramatized in sharper contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (to prove his theory about objects absorbing emotions) is clear and consistent, and his past with the prism humanizes him. However, his interior conflict between belief and doubt remains relatively smooth; we’re told he needs more than belief, but his struggle never feels sharply contradictory or risky. His emotional state is evoked more through concept than through specific, idiosyncratic embodiment under pressure. The final communion lands, but with limited visible cost beyond an abstracted sense of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—fleeing a devouring silence by accepting a burdensome errand—and her choice to leave after thirty years reads earned. Her interiority is textured (“not because she believed in its hope, but because the alternative was to let the silence swallow her whole”), though we get more mood than sharply contradictory impulses in the decision moment. The realization at the end—that the message was for her—is a credible internal shift with a visible cost (abandoning the orchard, loom, and shawl). The lack of any active on-page relationship limits the crucible effect, keeping this just short of elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to save the orchards by mending the planet’s wounds—feels grounded in his craft and prior study of the mines, and his meekness vs. inner resolve is cleanly sketched. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; he rarely hesitates or doubts once the plan begins, so we don’t see competing impulses in-scene. Embodied emotion appears (“sweat beaded on his brow”) but often yields to summary (“his heart full”). The ending shift (shoulders straighter, “found his voice”) is credible but slightly too tidy for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s core desire (to understand the withheld truth across versions of himself) is clear and consistent, and the shard functions as a strong character-object link. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses in the climactic moment. The other Kael adds pressure but feels more like a mouthpiece for exposition than a fully individuated counterpart. The final “decision” is not shown in a way that lets us feel the emotional cost, which blunts the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated by grief, duty, and reticence; the sea glass as talisman and his history with anonymous notes give him a concrete emotional engine. His key choices—coming to the lighthouse just for the glass, deciding to answer via stones, lighting the lamp, and finally leaving the glass—align cleanly with those motives. The inner conflict (silence vs answering, clinging vs letting go) is present but relatively understated, which keeps the arc from feeling fully knotted or risky. The realization about what haunts the lighthouse is a bit tidy but still earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veyra is vivid, specific, and memorable: a “laughing storm herald” who used to ink her fingers on godly obituaries is a sharply etched figure. Her motivation—to shape a new dawn from old shadows and to answer the call of the unborn city—reads clear and consistent. What’s missing, especially for elite-tier work, is a legible internal contradiction or cost; she never feels truly torn or pressured. The final recommitment to her role therefore lands as affirmation rather than a hard-won or costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dye master’s motivation—post-transplant restlessness and the need to understand why certain lives “shimmer”—is clear, specific, and threads the whole piece. His interiority is vivid and character-particular (tracking sun trails, studying mist) rather than generic. Internal conflict exists but remains relatively low-stakes and contemplative, with few moments of sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The relationship with the traveler is suggestive but not quite a crucible that forces a visibly costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias has a clear, particular interior life—his offerings to the walls and compulsive mapping make him feel specific, not generic. His motivation (seeking answers / teaching the tower to remember) tracks cleanly into the closing reconfiguration. Internal contradiction (fear of the tower vs tenderness toward it) is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure. The final stance shift from “prison” to “vessel” feels earned, though the on-page emotional cost remains subtle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent, and her small hesitations (“What if I forget the words?”) give a touch of vulnerability, but her inner life stays fairly archetypal and unconflicted. The keeper functions more as a mythic guide than a pressured character with her own stakes. Emotional states are mostly conveyed through familiar shorthand (“throat tight,” “heart ached”) rather than idiosyncratic perception. The final choice to sing feels motivated but not especially costly or psychologically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly rendered as a gentle, guilt-ridden recluse whose history with the turned-away woman convincingly motivates his final decision. His interiority is specific enough (“staying while leaving,” the festering regret) to feel individual, not generic. However, his conflict stays mostly in reflective summary rather than being pushed into sharper, on-page contradiction or messier irrationality. The cost of leaving—beyond a generalized risk to his solitude and role—could be more concretely felt to fully earn his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s sensibility as a “creeping normality noticer” is vivid and consistent, and his unease around the bakery’s erasure supplies a clear emotional throughline. His choice to go to the tea house and then to plant the seeds feels motivated and coherent, if somewhat low-stakes. Interiority is textured (“the taste a ghost of something he couldn’t name”) but largely one-note—there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine resistance around the act of planting. The woman is sketched with economical specificity but serves more as an archetypal guide than a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated by preserving meaning in a dying archive, and his professional habits (“gently meticulous”) are aligned with his choices at every beat. His emotional responses are embodied enough (trembling fingers, caught breath) to avoid abstraction, and his shift from passive cataloger to active guardian feels earned. However, his inner conflict is relatively mild and largely summarized—there’s little sense of genuine risk or competing impulses beyond sorrow versus resolve. The arc reads truthful but safe rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena reads as competent, shaped by her father’s world, with motives that are clear and consistent (protect the hush, study betrayal, honor Elias). Interiority is specific enough to feel lived-in, especially in how she uses the watch fob and reads the room. However, internal conflict is mild; the tension between wanting to “capture” trust breaking and wanting to prevent violence is gestured at more than it is dramatized as a true dilemma. Her intervention carries little visible personal cost beyond generic danger, which softens the sense of an earned change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is sharply sketched—a rational skeptic with private oddities (UV glow, weather-taste, inherited ring) and a specific intellectual curiosity. Her choice to follow the ring is motivated and in character, but she never faces a meaningful dilemma or visible cost. The storm-maker is more archetype than person, functioning mainly as an expositional mouthpiece. The ending hints at an internal reconfiguration (tightening on the ring, recalling her grandfather) but stops short of dramatizing a concrete, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by the lock’s call and his long practice of drawing the dead, and his actions (studying the lock, seeking the door, opening it) all align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory focus on charcoal, stone, and light. However, his inner conflict is minimal—he moves toward the door with little hesitation or contradiction—so the final choice doesn’t feel especially contested or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora is specific and textured—a meticulous, ethically anxious artisan in a collapsing ecology—and her curiosity plus unease around forgery feel credible. Her trait of “wilting near dishonesty” is nicely particular but mostly anchored in summarized past, not tested in the on-page quest. Her choice to pursue the Echo Vault is motivated but faces little internal resistance or competing desire, so the arc reads more as setup than as a costly change. Still, her perceptions and micro-choices (reassembling the map, deciding to go to the archives) reveal a coherent value hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation and quiet devotion are clear and specific, and his small, methodical choices (collecting the iceberg, then the toy) align well with his role and motive. The seasonally mute trait and loss of his mentor add texture without tipping into exposition. However, his internal life leans toward a single, serene register; there’s little simultaneous push–pull or contradiction under pressure. The final “choice” feels more like continued endurance than a sharpened renunciation, which keeps the arc strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid and specific—an android with “ghost” childhood memories and bottled fears feels particular, not stock. Motivation (contain chaos, avoid the burn, then choose inner release over preservation) is clear and mostly well-earned. The main limitation is that his internal conflict runs in one direction; once he opens the box, there’s little on-page resistance or competing impulse. The final realization about needing the roses lands, but edges toward tidy rather than deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s sensibility as an observant, gentle curator comes through clearly in her decision to keep the locket and in her choice to remain a silent witness. However, her internal conflict is minimal—she never feels genuinely torn or at risk, and we don’t see contradictory impulses in action. Clara’s brief appearance is emotionally pointed but underdeveloped as a distinct psyche rather than a function. The result is credible, textured characterization but not yet psychologically deep or pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her habit of tracing vibrations, her unease with the dice as “too raw”—and her final choice to enter the chamber feels motivated by a long-standing relationship with secrets and code. Her motivation to “liberate something” emerges gradually and coheres with the journal-as-defense motif. Internal contradiction (her need for encryption vs. confronting unencoded truth) is present but could be dramatized more sharply in on-page hesitation or cost. Kael works more as an embodied symbol than a fully realized person, but his presence still applies credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marlowe’s grief, superstition, and work-worn pragmatism are rendered with concrete, character-specific details (lantern routine, coffee-ground divination, hiding the journal). His motivation—to understand what happened to his sister and to the town’s warped reality—emerges organically and coheres by the time he decides to “answer” the whale. Internal conflict is present but relatively muted; he moves from unease to resolve without a strongly dramatized moment of genuine hesitation under pressure. Still, his final choice to step toward the chamber’s heart feels earned by prior images and realizations, with an implied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The summoner’s motivation (to release the burden of the prophecy and find peace) is clear and consistent, and his years of decoding give the ritual weight. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; he feels already half-resigned from the start, so the “choice” to let go doesn’t generate much in-scene struggle. Embodied emotion appears (“breath curling,” “hum beneath his knees”) but often yields quickly to abstraction. The final renunciation feels earned but not sharply costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara and Mira are both cleanly sketched with distinct motives—grief/legacy for Elara, guarded intimacy and hidden lineage for Mira—and their choices track logically. Interiority is specific enough to feel lived-in (Elara’s weekly visits, her awareness of Mira’s “guise”), and the father–daughter reveal credibly reshapes how we read Mira’s earlier behavior. However, internal contradiction under pressure is light; Elara transitions from secrecy to acceptance with little on-page struggle or visible cost. The relationship shifts meaningfully but still feels more like a gentle unfolding than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (grief, loyalty, and the need to vindicate Liora) is clear and consistent, and his shift from self-protective isolation to accepting connection feels earned by the scene. His interiority has some specific, character-particular touches (e.g., “translated his isolation into independence”), but the emotional turn is a bit tidy and lacks messy contradiction in the final beats. Liora reads as defined more by idea and function than by idiosyncratic personality, though her “archived” self is conceptually strong. The relationship dynamic does move and reconfigure by the end, but with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lian’s motivation (debt, father’s execution, commitment to truth over official history) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to seek self-freedom rather than revenge is credibly set up. Interiority is present but somewhat sketched; her contradictory impulses (need for justice vs desire to be done with the past) are told more than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. Vey functions effectively as an immediate pressure source but reads as a fairly standard, one-note villain. The emotional cost of Lian’s renunciation is implied but could be embodied more concretely in her reactions and bodily experience during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s vocation and core motive—understanding why some voices linger—are clear and consistently expressed, and her behavior around the shell feels grounded in that drive. The choice to join Veyan and “ensure they’re heard” is motivated, though the internal conflict around the implied cost (possibly joining the lost) remains underdeveloped. Veyan functions more as a catalyst than a fully realized character, but his presence sharpens Liora’s decision enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s vocation, skepticism, and ethical orientation are distinct and consistent, and her final refusal to reveal the truth grows plausibly from the “salvager of echoes” who “weaves truth carefully.” However, her internal conflict—between exposing the quartermaster and honoring the dead’s desire for silence—remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in scene. The week-long investigation is summarized, so we never see her values tested moment-to-moment. The ending endurance/renunciation is convincing but could land harder with more embodied ambivalence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ren and Mei both feel specific and grounded—his net-mender’s contemplativeness and her observant tea master persona are well-drawn, and his final invitation to “Stay” is motivated by his established appreciation for hidden effort and patterns. The relationship dynamic is gentle but clear, with status roughly equal and negotiated through small gestures (bringing tea, sharing the sketch). However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched—Ren’s supposed tension between solitude and connection doesn’t quite bite on the page, so the emotional cost of his choice remains modest. A bit more embodied conflict or hesitation at the moment of asking her to stay would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s professional identity and goal are clear and consistent, and small choices (staying to reassemble the letters, confronting the stranger verbally rather than fleeing) track logically. However, his interiority stays relatively generic—there’s little contradiction, moral tension, or real fear even when he realizes the stakes of the cover-up. The stranger is more function than person, with minimal depth or distinct voice beyond exhaustion. The final “no matter the cost” is asserted rather than grounded in prior, felt sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—envy of Kael, loneliness, and belief in the dead’s whispers—is clear and consistent, and his decision to descend the mountain flows naturally from that setup. We get concrete interiority (“his heart a storm of envy and longing”), though his contradictions (hunger for power vs. isolation, awe vs. arrogance) are more implied than fully dramatized in scene. Kael remains a flat foil rather than a pressured character, so relationship dynamics don’t fully ignite. The final shift from recluse to would-be leader is believable but lands without much visible emotional cost or hesitation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and believable—a washed-up, ink-stained poet whose sensitivity and stubbornness make sense of his project with the jars. His emotional life is mostly shown through concrete obsessions (sounds, echoes) rather than labels, and his choice to share the jars with the girl reveals a quiet hierarchy of values (connection over secrecy). The final self-redefinition as “translator between generations” is thematically apt but slightly tidy, with limited on-page struggle in that moment. Internal contradiction (resentful vs. hopeful, misanthropic vs. generous) is present but could be dramatized more under pressure rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (protecting the key while wrestling with his own guilt) is clear and consistent, and his final choice to seize the artifact at personal cost feels earned. The internal conflict—fear of psychic shattering versus need for absolution—is present but could be made messier or more contradictory on the page. The scavenger functions effectively as a pressure agent but remains thinly sketched beyond role and attitude. The line “His own regrets coiled in his chest” is a strong moment, but his guilt could surface in more specific, character-particular images.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s vocation and temperament are clear, and his long practice of watching “moon paths” gives him a coherent inner life, but his conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices. The most revealing moment—choosing not to reach for his knife—is promising but underdeveloped as a true dilemma. His desire to “sculpt patience from his own impatience” is thematically strong yet mostly asserted. The stranger remains a cipher, functioning more as a mouthpiece than a character exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s profession, family legacy, and current predicament create a coherent, specific character with credible professional competence and unease. His conflicting impulses—fear, duty, and the urge to break free—are on the page, especially around the door and when sending the evidence. However, his inner life remains somewhat schematic; we’re told his conclusions and resolve more than we feel them grinding through embodied hesitation or error. Voss is a flat, purely functional antagonist presence, offering no real relational crucible beyond being “the bad boss.”

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched: a priest whose professional identity (absolution, second chances) clashes with his complicity in an execution, and his guilt is concretely anchored to the clockwork heart. His interiority is specific (“metronome for guilt,” “lie tasted like rust”), and his final choice to act rather than merely regret feels motivated. Internal contradiction (mercy vs justice, faith vs doubt) is present but could be pushed harder under pressure. Kael is functional and slightly textured but remains more a device than a full crucible relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to be heard by the unheard bell) is clear, rooted in his parents’ deaths and his own daredevil habits, and his banter with Veyra gives him some edge and specificity. His interiority (“It wasn’t about the sound… though the lie tasted like copper”) shows self-deception, but the internal contradiction between futility and hope could be pressed harder under peak pressure. Veyra functions well as a grounded counter-voice but doesn’t significantly evolve across the scene. The final choice to ring the bell feels earned, though the personal cost to Elias remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s motivation and professional role are clear and specific, and her choice to continue despite danger feels earned. Her interiority, though sometimes summarized rather than dramatized (“Lena’s motivation wasn’t just professional; it was personal”), still shows a believable blend of disillusionment and compulsion. Internal conflict appears but remains relatively thin—her hesitation about danger is brief and quickly overridden without much contradictory texture. Elias reads more as a function of the plot than as a character, but that’s appropriate for the length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is crisply sketched—a shadow-laced peacekeeper driven by trust in intuition and others’ safety—but his interior conflict is minimal, with little friction between fear, doubt, and duty. His motivation to protect the village and honor the seer is clear and consistent, and his decisive act of throwing the fragment is well-aligned with that. However, the emotional cost of his choices is underdeveloped; the story leaves his shadows, flaws, and potential self-interest largely unexplored. This keeps him compelling but not yet at a deep literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular (“needed to hear the sound of endings”), and his small choices—sitting by the man, giving the parasol tip, accepting the clipboard—track a clear arc from voyeur to participant. The embodied details (weight on ribs, thumb on ivory) ground his emotional state. Internal conflict (coming as a euthanasia tourist vs. staying to help) is present but could be sharpened with more explicit friction at the moment of deciding to help. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently, though their pressure on him remains gentle rather than crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and embodied (calloused hands, weight in her chest, fixation on the burned letter), and her ambivalence toward Elias is credibly layered. Her final reach for his hand feels earned by the preceding hurt, doubt, and vineyard-root imagery. Elias is somewhat idealized and functionally apologetic, with less textured flaw than Liora. The reconciliation trends a bit tidy, but still reads as a believable, costly softening rather than an instant reset.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line walker is specific, with the half-mask, tactile engagement with the pavilion, and the clear trait of almost compulsive honesty that motivates his role. His uncertainty about what “consecrate” means creates a credible internal tension that the story resolves through realization rather than action. However, the conflict between honesty and cost is mostly told (“saved and doomed”) rather than dramatized in the present, so his flaw never bites on the page. The prophet remains largely archetypal, offering pressure but little relational texture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clear, coherent, and competently drawn, with a believable vocation and temperament, but he never quite sharpens into someone idiosyncratic beyond “gentle archivist seeking meaning.” His motivation—“to transmute their pain into a masterpiece”—is stated plainly and his actions align, yet they’re rarely tested or complicated in scene. The late realization that he has “forgotten to live his own story” hints at internal conflict, but this tension is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Emotional states tend toward smooth, contemplative progression rather than contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reticence, reverence for knowledge, and obsessive curiosity are clearly established and his actions (whispering to the crystal, humming, pressing it to his temple) all grow logically from that core. Motivation—“to decode the pattern of growth”—is explicit and coherent with his scholarly temperament. Internal contradiction is only lightly touched (comfort in silence vs. need to “testify”) so we don’t see much genuine struggle or cost. The final acceptance of his role as “witness” feels earned but emotionally muted rather than deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The junkyard prophet’s motives (to capture the sound of aging, to anchor his unreliable precognition) are clear and consistently drive his choices: coming to the garden, arranging driftwood, and accepting the tape. His flaw—seeing slivers of the future but losing them—credibly fuels both his frustration and his compulsion to ritualize. The relationship with the mist-woman is sketched but pointed; her “You always forget, but I remember for you” creates a lived history without exposition. The internal contradiction (wanting to remember while being doomed to forget) is strong, though his emotional life remains more lyric than deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—“to harness the ephemeral”—and his technical focus feels grounded in his long history with cameras. However, he reads as largely single-note in his obsession; there’s little on-page contradiction or moral tension between his awe, his fear, and his survival instinct. His key choices (restructuring the camera, then finally leaving with the photograph) track logically but are taken without much visible struggle. The result is credible and coherent, but not yet psychologically rich enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias and Lena are cleanly and economically drawn, with clear histories implied by small details (the mother’s record, their “oldest friend” bond). Elias’s “decisively kind” behavior under pressure and Lena’s mix of humor and firmness give the relationship texture without sentimentality. Motivation is straightforward and credible: he comes because she asks, stays because he’s committed to giving her the goodbye she wants. The only limit is relatively light internal contradiction—he feels pain but never wavers or missteps, so his arc reads more as dignified endurance than complicated evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Liora’s core drive—intellectual curiosity about shadows and the key—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (descending, using the key, accepting the guardian’s charge) align with that. However, she faces little real resistance or dilemma; there’s minimal sense of competing impulses or cost. Her emotions are mostly summarized (fogged breath, tightened fingers) rather than deeply embodied or particularized. The closing realization feels earned but also somewhat frictionless, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena is sharply sketched as a “forgiving skeptic,” and her choice to stay, return to the garden, and follow the map is coherent and grounded in that trait. Her interiority is specific (“kept it not for luck, but for proof”), and her final acceptance of the changeling feels earned. However, genuine internal contradiction is underplayed—she rarely wavers or feels torn, so the emotional cost of her choice remains muted. The changeling itself is more symbolic than individuated, which flattens the relationship’s crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to redeem a past failure and find a way to share light safely—and her interiority is concrete and specific (father, gem polishing, failed lanterns). The emotional palette is well-embodied (cold water on her knees, weight of sea glass, remembered dust on skin). Internal conflict is present but gentle; she moves from guilt to acceptance without much on-page resistance or self-contradiction. The final shift feels earned but a bit tidy, with limited sense of what flaw will continue to cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s watchful, obsessive care (the notebook, following icicle patterns, returning to the data center) and Mira’s guilt-made-skittishness (flinching from their mother, leaving only at dusk) feel particular and embodied. Their relationship is the crucible, with the pendant theft and return providing a clean emotional test. The final shared gesture—hanging the pendant—reads as a credible, earned softening rather than a sudden conversion. Internal contradiction is present but could be pushed harder (Elias’s surveillance isn’t really interrogated), keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a conflicted novelist with a tangible, embodied relationship to his unfinished work and to hope (“its hollow chambers echoing with the sound of his unfinished novel”). His motivation—to understand and “solemnize” hopes, including his own—is coherent and threads through each encounter. Internal conflict appears (ambition vs. uncertainty, grasping vs. letting pass) but stays largely reflective rather than dramatized in clashing impulses within a single beat. The final choice to turn back feels earned, though the cost is more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s whimsical, underfed dreamer persona is vivid and consistent, and her motivation to respond to the tendril and vindicate forgotten practices is clear. However, she faces little internal contradiction—she never seriously doubts, resents, or fears what’s happening—so her choice to sing feels almost frictionless. The nickname “the Dreamer Who Forgets to Eat” and her neglected tools are strong embodied touches. The closing resolve to return to the village is emotionally plausible but not framed as a difficult or costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is specific and consistent—the compulsion to “translate heartbeats into maps” and the anomalous desire to seal the pause instead of the pulse feels lived-in rather than contrived. His history of burning things versus this wish to preserve a single still moment gives him credible internal tension. The embodied patience (slow movements, the spider-web metaphor) aligns with his ritualistic method. The final understanding about holding and letting go is earned by the preceding fixation on preservation, though the emotional cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is specific, competent, and plausibly obsessed, with craft details (chalk marks, quartz, gears) grounding his interiority. His motivation—to capture and later savor “quiet moments” when the world holds its breath—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is mild (he’s reverent and methodical, but not sharply torn), so the final reorientation toward letting go feels earned but not hard-won. Emotional embodiment is more atmospheric than visceral, which slightly softens the felt cost of his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—understanding the shapes of burdens rather than simply carrying them—is clear, specific, and carries through to the end. Her micro-choices (lighting the lamp despite risk, letting each burden touch or coil around her) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present but underplayed: the text states the danger of being turned to bronze, yet we don’t feel a real moment of wavering or fear as that threat nears. The final lightness she feels is earned but emotionally a bit too smooth for the severity of the costs invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority feels specific and embodied—the ritual with the kettle, her relationship to the ash blank, and the tactile focus on grain and knife reveal a textured, credible grief. Her contradictory impulses (clinging to the “lion tamer’s widow” identity vs. reaching toward carving and “enough”) operate simultaneously rather than in neat stages. The final acceptance of the loft’s “rust-hued peace” reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a tidy cure. Jarek is present only in memory, but those memories sharply shape her present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scavenger’s interiority is specific and textured—regret as “damp mist,” ambitions eroding with the camera wheel is vivid and character-particular. Her core motivation (to revisit an earlier, resolute self and negotiate with that ghost) is clearly seeded and paid off. Contradictory impulses—wanting to bargain yet fearing the gaze of her own reflection—are present but could be dramatized under more acute pressure rather than primarily observed. The final shift to “Now… you listen” reads earned, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than sharply felt in a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s characterization is clear, specific, and rooted in her professional lens and curiosity; her “functionally creative” mindset shows in how she reads structure and water as equations. The caretaker woman is sketched efficiently and feels like a real, if lightly drawn, counterpoint. However, Mara’s internal conflict is relatively gentle—there’s little contradiction or real cost around her shift from assessor to hopeful co-visionary, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—solitary, meticulous, haunted by his mother and an abandoned ambition—and his actions (taking the girl in, fixing the box, following the bear) all align with those traits. The echo between the girl’s box and his own childhood deepens his motivation without overstatement. However, his internal conflict at the key turn (whether to follow the bear) is underplayed; we get fear and habit hinted, but not a fully dramatized tug-of-war. The final peace-making feels earned but relatively gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The legend seeker has clear, specific motivation and a distinct inner lens (radio static, “architecture of lies”), and his small choices under pressure (boarding, prying open the crate, lifting the mirror) track well with that. The salvage rationalization gives a flicker of moral tension, but internal contradiction stays muted; he adapts quickly rather than truly wrestling with what he finds. The final recognition of “himself…as he might have been” is a credible, earned shift, though the epiphany lands a touch neatly. Overall he reads as particular and coherent, but with room for more fraught, on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s core motivation—to preserve encoded ancient knowledge—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his attention to the rope and seeds. His interiority is mostly conceptual rather than emotionally textured, and there’s little on-page contradiction or real internal conflict under pressure. The final stance (continuing to decode, planning to question the old woman) feels consistent but low-cost, more continuation than earned renunciation or shift. This is strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the charged, crucible level for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s vocation and guilt-driven motive around “explaining” absences are precise and consistent, and the act of pressing the thread into the soil is a clear, character-specific choice. The interiority is rich and embodied (“left her hollowed out”), with a strong sense of weariness and duty. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper contradiction or live internal conflict in the present scene—she mostly affirms what she already believes rather than being torn between impulses on the page. The final endurance choice (to keep writing) feels emotionally right but arrives as a restatement more than a hard-won pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—reviving the Luminis as a way to restore beauty and redeem himself—is clear, specific, and drives each choice. His shift from mechanical control to vulnerable belief is well earned and embodied in concrete actions (setting aside the contraption, singing old lullabies). However, his inner contradictions stay relatively soft; we don’t see much simultaneous push-pull between pride, despair, faith, and self-loathing on the page. The arc convinces but lacks the layered messiness and sharper costs that would push this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena is strongly etched: the arsonist father, firefighter vocation, and coin all root her motivation and worldview in concrete particulars, and her gentleness with the child feels earned. We see believable contradiction—fear of dark vs running toward fire, love for a monstrous father vs dedication to healing. The internal aim “to prove that scars could sing” is clear but often stated rather than pressured into sharper conflict. The child is mostly a foil and lacks much depth, so the relationship doesn’t quite become a crucible that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s blend of skepticism and haunted longing is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (prying the box open, following the breadcrumbs, choosing to descend) track cleanly with those traits. The grief-laced relationship with her grandmother, including the mutual accusations (“You died before you could tell me everything.” / “And you were too afraid to ask.”), gives the interaction bite rather than sentimentality. Internal conflict—fear versus the compulsion to face what’s been taken—could be pushed one step further under maximum pressure at the door. Nonetheless, her final decision to unlock and go down feels earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated—a weary, long-lived sentimentalist trying to “share light without using fire”—and his history with failed civilizations gives him texture. The embodied detail of the gear biting his skin is effective, but his internal conflict is muted: he doesn’t seriously waver, and we don’t feel much fear or guilt about the cost of his choice. Kael functions more as a thematic foil than a fully pressured grandson with his own contradictions. The final stance (accepting that the cycle isn’t broken but might be) is emotionally plausible, though it arrives a bit gently given the scale of his project.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation and grief are rendered with concrete, character-specific detail (the reverent stone-carving, the Keats memories), and his choices—following the ribbon, returning to the greenhouse, hanging the banner—track cleanly with that inner life. The story convincingly shows a gentle internal shift from isolation to connection. However, moments of realization are occasionally summarized in abstract terms (“By the time the last butterflies had flown south, Elias understood”), which dulls some of the messy, contradictory feel of live grief. There’s little visible internal conflict or self-sabotage on the page, so the arc feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt and ethical diligence are clear, particular, and consistently dramatized through his rituals with the clock and the rake handle. His motivation to “fix” the pendulum feels organic, and the act of transferring the inscriptions to the bob is a credible extension of his worldview. Internal contradiction (duty vs. desire for absolution) is present but relatively smooth, with little resistance or self-sabotage once the solution appears. The final sense of lightness is earned but perhaps a bit tidy given the depth of his listed sins.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and outlook (“blithe care of a gardener who saw beauty in the quiet persistence of roots”) create a specific, appealing interiority, and his curiosity about intentions plausibly drives his actions. The late self-recognition—“never realizing how much he longed to hear their voices”—lands as an earned but quiet shift. However, his internal conflict stays mild; we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses or a truly pressured choice. The change is more gentle clarification than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to jolt a stagnant scholarly culture by mapping possibility rather than prophecy—is clear, consistent, and embedded in her profession. Her skepticism of magic versus belief in patterns gives her a credible internal tension, though it never quite sharpens into a difficult, felt dilemma on the page. Emotions are mostly articulated conceptually rather than through embodied contradictions under pressure, which keeps her from feeling fully lived-in. The final “invitation” stance is earned but carries little visible cost beyond fatigue and abstract risk.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—lonely, meticulous, clinging to craft in a silent world—and his micro-choices (tuning the radio, collecting dust, persisting with transcription) align with that. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict or competing impulses; once he hears the song, every step follows without hesitation. The emotional texture is embodied but relatively one-note (quiet yearning turning to quiet hope). The final shift to purpose feels earned but low-cost, more discovery than difficult change.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and plausibly obsessed; his rituals with his mother’s ashes and the way he tests frames for “pulses” reveal him with economical, concrete strokes. His motivation—completing/understanding the portrait as a proxy for understanding his mother—is clear and threads the whole piece. The internal turn from “crystallize” to “outrun” an emotion feels earned but is stated a bit too declaratively. I would like one sharper moment of visible ambivalence or self-deception under pressure to push this into truly standout territory.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched: obsessive, contrarian, and self-exiled, with clear motives rooted in temperament and intellect. His choices (living in the sewer, hoarding broken things, deciding to take the findings to dockworkers instead of scholars) arise logically from that characterization. However, his emotional life is narrow—mostly disdain and fixation—so we get little contradiction or real vulnerability under pressure. The final decision feels consistent but not hard-won enough to reveal a new facet of him.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly motivated by preserving “vanishing arts” and healing the choir, and her tactic with the zither feels specific to her temperament. Secondary characters (Maren, Liora, Harkin) are sketched efficiently with distinct roles in the social dynamic. The emotional shift—especially Maren’s change in behavior—is earned but a bit idealized, with limited on-page ambivalence or relapse. Interiority is evocative yet relatively light on contradictory impulses under pressure, which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to reclaim and redistribute beauty through memory-healing food—is clear and consistently expressed. Her vocation and gift are well-linked to her choices, and the bite of the fruit meaningfully reconfigures her emotional state. However, the “curse” aspect of her gift is mostly told rather than dramatized, and there’s little true internal contradiction or struggle on the page. The final stance feels earned but low-friction, with limited sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s curse, his small rebellions (keeping the box, entering the forbidden tower), and his gentle desire to “preserve wonder in routine” give him specificity beyond a stock watcher-character. Maren’s competence and latent ruthlessness (“smooth as honey but edged with steel”) play well against him and drive the plot. However, the involuntary-truth trait is underused and lightly contradicted (he lies about the box with no concrete consequence), and their internal conflicts never quite cut deep enough to feel transformative. The final choice to strike the match lands but carries limited visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a meticulous observer of the uncanny ordinary, with his profession of “cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling” giving him a distinct interior lens. His motivation—to understand and, secondarily, to “sanctify” living houses—is clear and consistent. The culminating choice to walk away rather than re-engage the house functions as a quiet renunciation but the emotional cost of that refusal remains relatively understated. A stronger sense of internal contradiction under peak pressure (temptation to stay vs flight) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    The diver’s motivation (to uncover and reclaim the gardeners’ legacy) is clear and consistent, and her hesitation before threading the ampoule gives her at least a moment of credible internal conflict. However, her inner life remains somewhat generalized—she reads more as “the Seeker of Truth” than as a fully particular person with idiosyncratic fears or blind spots. The statue’s role is psychologically thinner, mostly a poised expositor with a vow rather than a being under pressure. The final shift—from certainty to accepting nuance—lands, but the emotional cost of that shift is gestured at more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly sketched—“grim optimist,” mathematician, “balancedly daring”—and his choice to meddle with the staircase feels consistent with those traits. The interiority is specific enough (hope “like a bruise,” fixation on odds) to avoid genericness. However, his internal conflict is muted: he rarely wavers or reveals genuinely competing impulses under pressure. The final stance shift (seeking limits → accepting change within infinity) is credible but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The painter’s motives—insomnia, the pull of the moon-brush, and the need to honor remembered kindness—are clear and consistently dramatized through specific choices (painting strangers’ faces, distributing the work). Interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers trembling not from fatigue but from the weight of the…brush”) with a distinct sensibility. The main weakness is limited internal contradiction: once she commits to this ritual, there’s little visible friction between despair and hope. The ending stance (“She wasn’t tired. Not anymore.”) feels earned but lightly tested, so the change reads quiet rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation—saving dying arts as a way to repair both communal and personal loss—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her choices (opera glass, bakery, returning with the loaf). Her interiority is concrete and character-particular (“voice like aged parchment,” flour on waking, the expectation of a revelation from the bread). Internal conflict is present but gentle: she both believes in the elders’ myth and doubts anything she does will be enough, yet the tension never sharpens into a genuinely costly dilemma. Relationships with Orlan and the baker add light pressure but don’t meaningfully transform under strain, which keeps this just short of truly high stakes characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s curiosity and “counter-clockwise” ethos motivate every action, and his competence with mechanisms feels specific and earned. However, his inner conflict is muted: once he decides to “step beyond fate’s design,” there’s little hesitation or contradictory impulse on the page. We get strong embodied reaction at the first reversal of gravity, but not a sustained struggle between fear and desire. The final shift to feeling time as “a choice” is conceptually rich yet lands more as idea than as a hard-fought emotional evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (to test whether he’s hollow or possessed) is clear, grounded in the resuscitation and the cursed Polaroid. His fear and curiosity coexist believably, and his decision to press his palm to the mirror is an earned, character-driven risk. The final renunciation of cloak and photo tracks cleanly with his internal shift. The only limitation is that the victory comes a bit swiftly, with less visible emotional fraying under peak pressure than this setup could support.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward has a clear, specific motive (turning obstacles into instruments) and an embodied sensory relationship to sea, wood, and sound. However, he faces little real opposition or inner contradiction; his emotions tend toward awe and satisfaction rather than mixed impulses under pressure. The shift from interpreter-of-omens to collaborator is graceful but low-cost, more an affirmation than a hard-won change. As a result, he feels vivid but not yet fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (curiosity plus unease about the sealed world) is clear and consistently drives her choices from chiseling the crack to fleeing and reorienting her mission. Her interiority has some nice particulars (“driven by something she could not name”) and embodied reactions, but her internal conflict (curiosity vs. fear vs. duty to the city) is only lightly dramatized on the page. The moment with the altered expedition could support a sharper, more contradictory inner struggle before she bolts. The final renunciation—choosing not to stay and “join” them but to seek other cracks—is earned but could land with a slightly keener sense of personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives and conflict—historian vs. thief, truth vs. narrative—are clear and consistent, and his final compromise grows credibly from what we’ve seen. The parallel with the scribe crystallizes his internal dilemma without feeling like a contrivance. Liora’s function as a principled skeptic is strong, though her shift from opposition to alignment happens a bit quickly. Emotional embodiment leans more conceptual than visceral at peak beats, which keeps this just shy of truly immersive interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as quietly obsessive and empathetic, with his “archeologist of abandoned dreams” self-conception and the inkwell ritual giving him specificity. His stoic sensitivity is embodied in the way he absorbs each note’s despair without flinching yet feels it physically (“chest tightened”). The internal conflict between preservation and acceptance surfaces most clearly in his final message about love and surrender but could be dramatized with slightly more on-page hesitation or friction before he chooses to add his own notes rather than, say, extract the old ones. The change at the end—accepting his role as “keeper of echoes” rather than savior—is credible and earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to uncover the origin of the stamp—is clear, specific, and sustained, and his identity shock on seeing “Veyne” lands credibly. His calm professionalism and “logical page indexer” mindset give him distinct texture. However, his inner conflict is relatively soft: there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine risk to his sense of self beyond a neat epiphany. The final stance shift (choosing to stay) feels earned but lightly priced, more serene than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veyra’s grief, craftiness, and opportunism are sharply drawn through specific habits (stealing dreams, folding cranes, indifference to the priests), giving her a distinct and plausible psychology. Her motivation—to manipulate others’ grief because her own is knotted around her brother—is clear and coherently drives her methods. Internal contradiction (seeking control of grief while feeding on uncontrollable sorrow) is present but more implied than dramatized in active choices. The final “transformation” lands as a meaningful change, though we don’t quite see a consciously chosen stance under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s grief and transformation from almost-bride to hunter are vividly anchored in specific images (charred lace, drone hum that “never left”), giving her a strong, particular interior life. Her motivation—to pursue whatever the geode represents back to the moment of loss—is clear, if a bit abstractly framed. Internal contradiction (need for answers vs. implied self-destruction) is present but under-dramatized in scene; she rarely hesitates or chooses between competing values. The ending stance (“The hunt wasn’t over. It had only just begun.”) feels earned but not sharply reconfigured by a visible on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s jaded competence against the pilgrim’s wonder creates a clear, effective character dyad, and his final nod reads as an earned shift from skepticism to acceptance. His motivation (a lifetime of chasing signals / fragments) is well tied to the premise of “belonging as frequency,” though it remains more sketched than deeply embodied. The pilgrim is more archetypal than individuated, defined primarily by “perpetual surprise” and the chip. Emotional texture is present but could use one sharper, character-specific contradiction or cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply etched: the black-market genealogist whose professional lies mirror his family’s lies creates a strong, specific contradiction. His guilt is embodied (watch, terrace, breath as “sieved hush”) rather than labeled. The final act of snapping the watch hand is well-earned by his history and current pressure. The uncle is thinner but functions effectively as a moral mirror and plot catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and coherent—his attachment to the drawer pull, his weariness with negotiation, and his past “untethering” all read as rooted in character. The conflict between wanting to escape this life and feeling bound by duty/friendship is present but could be pushed harder under on-page pressure. Seris works more as a suggestive outline than a fully realized counterpart; her “thoughtfulness” is mostly told, not dramatized. The final stance (continuing to carry mistakes as “stones in a pocket”) feels earned but not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—living out his father’s dream and then rejecting it—is clear and consistent, and the heirloom compass nicely externalizes his conflict. His interiority is concrete enough (“half sob, half relief”) and we see simultaneous impulses: obligation to his father vs. desire for self-determination. The final renunciation (throwing the compass) feels earned by the prior backstory and present-tense struggle. A few lines edge toward generalized reflection rather than character-particular thought, slightly softening his uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the neural reset, his mercenary past, and his current, grudging self-awareness create a credible, specific interiority. His motivation—"a reason to keep going"—is intriguing but under-articulated in concrete terms, so his stakes never fully peak. Internal conflict between coldness and the enforced new conscience is present but could be dramatized more through on-page micro-choices beyond the left/right pick. Mara functions well as a foil, though her pressure on him remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation—to call back a lost lover in altered form—is clear, specific, and drives every choice. Her usual composure versus tonight’s trembling gives a credible internal contradiction, and the final acceptance of his new form reads as an earned shift with visible cost. The lover’s characterization is thinner but adequate for this length, mostly functioning as a projection surface for her grief. A slightly deeper sense of her flaw or blind spot (beyond simple attachment) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is specific, textured, and consistently filtered through her vocation and family history, and her final acceptance (not flinching, resting her hands) is emotionally earned. Motivation—to locate “where lost time accumulates”—is clear and coherently drives every choice. The main limitation is that her conflict stays largely on one tonal register of sorrowful reverence, with relatively little contradictory impulse or behavioral variance under pressure. A touch more friction between doubt and devotion in the present moment would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s vocation and temperament are clear and particular—“last steadfast pacifist,” barefoot in algae-lit corridors, stitching memories—so she reads as more than a type. However, her pacifism and inner contradictions are asserted more than tested; there’s little sense of genuine temptation, doubt, or competing impulse under pressure. Her micro-choices (answering each accusation, choosing not to go through the dimension herself) track well with her stated values and feel motivated. The emotional cost at the end (alone but lighter, locket empty) is suggestive but could be deepened by sharper embodiment of her loss or loneliness in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s core paradox—self-impoverishing generosity paired with secret “orchestrated coincidences”—is vivid and specific, and his final shift from “no one” to “necessary” is earned. However, internal conflict mostly stays summarized rather than dramatized in the peak moment, and the transformation is accepted quickly once the prophecy arrives. Emotions are often labeled in elevated, slightly generic terms (“heart too big,” “destitute philanthropist”) rather than embodied under stress. The woman functions more as a prophetic mouthpiece than a fully pressuring character, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s competence and vocation are sharply drawn—“vigilant lock sentinel” with etched-rune goggles and intimate knowledge of the fort’s locks. Her motivation to avert the governor’s plan and ignite a counter-revolution is clear and consistent with her skills. However, there is little genuine inner contradiction or visible emotional cost; she moves from perception to execution with very little hesitation or moral friction. The final choice to light the torch and walk away feels purposeful but emotionally under-interrogated for elite-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear core—an inherited obligation and a lifelong obsession with patterns—and his choices (using the star dust, arranging the rocks, accepting the shard) align with that. However, his emotional life stays somewhat summarized (“weight in his chest, a debt unpaid”) and we don’t see much contradictory impulse or real hesitation under pressure. The curse, the father, and the grandmother are sketched rather than deeply dramatized, so his final lightness feels earned conceptually more than viscerally. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the depth expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—“censored poet,” the theft of the timer, and his history with protest images all build a coherent psyche whose fixation on scars-as-maps feels earned. His motivation “to understand the cartography of scars” is clear and threads through his handling of the photograph and timer. The final acceptance that “some maps were never meant to be read, only carried” is a believable evolution of that motive into a kind of earned stasis, though the internal conflict itself could be sharper (fewer clear contradictory impulses on the page). The woman in the photograph functions only as an emblem, so there’s no relational crucible to push him into harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motive—years of waiting for this specific duel as a covert overture—is clear and character-specific, and Isolde’s role as “architect of his most pivotal questions” gives their dynamic weight. However, interior conflict is relatively thin; his “storm in his chest” never complicates his poise in any concrete, irrational way. The mechanical arm is thematically mentioned as “an improvement” but never pressures an on-page choice. The relationship does shift credibly from opposition to tentative partnership, yet the emotional cost of that shift is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lumen is sharply sketched: the molting identities, denial of being a poet, and fixation on inmate marginalia create a particular, believable psyche. His motivation—to stop drifting between names and join something enduring—is clear and drives his choice to use the key and rebuild. The contradiction between wanting to be “nothing” and wanting to be part of the resistance is present but could surface more viscerally under pressure. Elias works well as a catalyzing foil, though the relationship is a touch tidy for the emotional stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, ritualistic relationship to the broken clock, and “strategically creative” mindset produce a specific, convincing interior life. His decision to exploit the film-loophole and play the wild encore is well-motivated by his need for refuge from grief, not mere spectacle. Internal conflict (wanting chaos yet clinging to memory) is present but could be sharpened in-scene—his hesitation at the keys is suggestive but brief. Relationships are mostly off-page (wife, travelers), so the crucible is largely him versus his own grief and the world’s rules, which works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s role, doubts, and duty are clear and consistent, and her avoidance of the dreams gives her a credible internal conflict. Her decision to plant the seed is motivated by Nani’s pressure and the dream, and her final resolve to tell the village feels like an earned shift from fear to acceptance. However, her struggle comes a bit too smoothly—her fear of unraveling her people’s beliefs isn’t tested against any concrete pushback or visible cost. Nani functions mostly as a catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and convincing: a slow, methodical tutor whose habits (the hat, the bonsai, the lace) and regrets all feel coherent. His motivation—processing the severance and seeking the “color of unspoken apologies”—is clear and threads through the story. The internal change from paralyzing regret to a gentler, mending stance is earned, though his conflict remains relatively low-intensity and rarely shows sharply contradictory impulses in the moment. The ending choice to “mend” rather than cut has emotional cost but could be deepened with a more visibly fraught alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's internal state is largely delivered via summary ("She wanted to strip needless drama") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or actions in the moment. The epiphany is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a pressured choice, making Elara feel more like a thematic vessel than a living agent. Internal conflict is stated as backstory rather than experienced as an active struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora's "steadily adaptive" trait is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through distinct choices under pressure. Her interiority leans into romanticized abstractions ("vessels that held stories") that distance the reader from her immediate, gritty reality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization is functional but relies on stock markers of trauma ("weight of survival") rather than embodied contradiction. Liora serves primarily as an exposition delivery system, and Elias's emotional arc—from despair to triumph—feels unearned by the brief summary of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions as a capable vessel for the plot rather than a conflicted agent; his primary obstacle (the ocean) is negated by a convenient "gift." The "stubborn" trait is applied as a label to motivate the journey rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    Liora functions more as an archetypal figure in a fable than a psychologically specific protagonist. While her motivation is consistent, her interiority is summarized rather than dramatized in moments of pressure, and her "gentle but unyielding" nature is stated as a label rather than proven through difficult, contradictory on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lien is defined more by expository labels ("pilgrim of sparks") than organic behavior, and her lack of hesitation at the climax ("Lien didn’t hesitate") bypasses the dramatic struggle needed to earn the resolution. The internal conflict regarding "unused love" is resolved via a convenient external vessel rather than a difficult personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal drive to preserve memory is well-established, and her agency in the climax is decisive. However, the emotional processing of the climax—disintegrating her mother’s echo—is rushed, lacking the visceral hesitation or embodied conflict such a traumatic act warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The POV character, Mira, acts primarily as a witness to Vey's competence; he finds the arrow, solves the puzzle, and neutralizes the threat while she carries the sack. She lacks meaningful agency or distinct internal conflict beyond general survival anxiety, resulting in a passenger-seat narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is deeply rooted in the specific sensory condition (synesthesia), which colors every observation and memory. The internal conflict—reconciling the pain of betrayal with the need for closure—drives the narrative effectively. The protagonist's competence with the forge (soldering scars) grounds his actions, making the "magic" of the ending feel earned through labor rather than just wish fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on romanticized archetypes rather than psychological depth; Lira’s internal state is defined by abstract longing ("destiny's door") rather than grounded desire. The immediate, friction-free connection with Kael prevents any meaningful status dynamics or earned vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("too curious," "parts of him that needed people") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's internal struggle is resolved through abstract realizations rather than difficult choices or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's traits are largely "told" through diagnostic exposition ("She was firmly adaptive") rather than demonstrated in scene. The phobia and stunt background appear as backstory flavor but do not meaningfully constrain the present action or choice. The emotional arc resolves too neatly, shifting from fear to instant forgiveness without sufficient on-page processing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for atmospheric description, with motivation ("to retell") asserted retroactively rather than demonstrated through drive. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("warmth," "shed a weight") rather than embodied emotion or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation—the search for the origin of thoughts—is clear and drives the scene. Interiority is functional, though the "robot seeking soul" trope leads to some standard angst ("gnawed at him") rather than deeply individuated psychology. The choice to return to work reflects a coherent character trait, earning the stasis at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira and Elias are distinct, but their emotional pivot from suspicion to total vulnerability is rushed. The moment of "mutual understanding" feels unearned by the preceding conflict, relying on a shared realization that is stated rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct, internally consistent character whose motivation shifts organically from control to stewardship. The transition from "masterpiece" to "mended deception" is earned through his interaction with the setting, though the specific nature of his self-deception is told more than dramatized in the early beats. His micro-choices (polishing, placing marbles) reveal character effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her defining trait—"obliging"—is told rather than dramatized, then immediately discarded without internal friction when she rebels. The reaction at the ending (laughing in despair) feels like a stock response rather than a specific, embodied emotional consequence. The character serves the plot mechanics more than driving them through complex agency.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is clear, but agency is undermined by the convenient skill transfer at the climax; the bassoonist protagonist playing a violin "by instinct" breaks character logic and relies on magical possession rather than established competence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's "fault-tolerant" nature is a compelling internal framework that drives his reaction to the error. However, the shift from passive guilt to active searching relies on a sudden expansion of abilities (sensing the past via wind) rather than the established oracular skillset. The internal arc is clear, but the mechanism of his triumph feels slightly disconnected from his specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with skepticism grounded in backstory, though his rapid transition from "reckless explorer" to empathetic peace-broker feels slightly rushed. The internal monologue is vivid, but the shift to seeking a "swallowed truth" relies more on exposition than dramatized pressure. His reactions are consistent, yet the emotional pivot is told rather than fully shown through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist possesses a clear, consistent motivation (to witness/preserve silence) that drives the central choice to destroy the book. However, the emotional cost is undercut by the narration stating she was &quot;unmoved&quot; at the climax, and the moment of internal doubt triggered by the swan is dismissed too easily to register as a deep struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is passive and lacks internal contradiction; he accepts the central mystery's resolution without skepticism, struggle, or cost. The lack of conflicting impulses makes him a vessel for the plot rather than a fully realized character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara serves as a passive vessel for observation rather than an agent of change; her "oddness" is asserted rather than dramatized through friction. While her motivation explains her presence, her specific sensitivity acts as a license to receive plot information rather than a trait that compels difficult, defining choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias creates a functional focal point, but his inciting motivation—taking a lighthouse job solely due to a fortune cookie slip—strains literary plausibility. In the climax, he remains reactive, accepting an "explain-everything" monologue from the newcomer rather than forcing a resolution through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is explicitly labeled ("that was his motivation") rather than purely dramatized, which flattens the interiority. While the internal shift from fear to invitation is legible, the emotional cost feels somewhat abstract and resolved too easily by the surreal imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora creates a mood but lacks agency; her primary trait ("chronologically homesick") is told as a label rather than shown through behavior. The "rebellion" remains abstract interiority without a difficult on-page choice or sacrifice to earn the shift in state.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's internal arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("fractured," "whole") rather than embodied emotion, triggering the label-speak penalty. The resolution—a sudden feeling of wholeness after a brief vision—reads as an unearned switch-flip rather than a psychological shift paid for by the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on stock tropes (the wise disabled mentor, the broken student) and diagnostic labels ("emotional numbness") rather than embodied behavior. Mira is passive, serving as a vessel for Elias's lesson rather than an agent of her own change; her transformation is instantaneous and unearned by previous struggle or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("credibly curious," "nurturing integrity") rather than embodied action. While the storm recorder identity frames his perception well, the internal conflict is resolved through abstract assertion rather than a dramatized struggle between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is legible, but the emotional arc relies on the stranger delivering diagnostic therapy-speak ("Grief isn't something you fix") rather than earned internal struggle. The protagonist's "aromatic caution" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a high-stakes constraint or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    Lirien functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's concept; the "ethically playful" trait is applied as a label rather than dramatized through complex decision-making. The final realization feels like an unearned epiphany, disconnected from a visible internal struggle or specific personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is consistent, but she encounters no internal contradiction or difficult choices; her interaction with the setting is frictionless, lacking the struggle or limitations required for higher character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.1)
    Liora’s depth is asserted through diagnostic summary ("she cared too much") rather than dramatized through choice. The internal conflict remains theoretical; she performs the transaction without hesitation or visible cost, making her "professional thoroughness" a label rather than a tested trait.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias lacks internal friction; his "shrewd" instincts and "whimsical" nature coexist without generating choice-pressure or contradiction. The decision to open the letter and help is immediate, lacking a moment of genuine risk, hesitation, or cost that would define the character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora’s longing is established, but her internal arc resolves too easily; the transition from outsider to insider feels granted by the magic system rather than earned through a difficult, defining choice. The "hollow echo" of her sculptures suggests depth, but the immediate acceptance by the group bypasses the social friction necessary to make the belonging feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "illustrator" profession acts as a label rather than a lens for specific observation; Liora navigates by sound ("cadence"), not visual discipline. Motivation ("chasing") remains abstract, lacking the personal stakes or specific yearning required to ground the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("mathematics of emotion," "ambiguous loss") rather than dramatized behavior. Elias's motivation is abstract, and his epiphany feels like an unearned intellectual realization rather than a result of emotional struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear internal conflict between safety and connection, culminating in a decisive refusal at the end. However, the attribute "kindly methodical" is asserted as a label rather than fully dramatized, as his actions (stealing a knife, rushing) feel more desperate than methodical.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s internal arc from controller to surrender is clear but relies on diagnostic telling ("she understood transformation better than most") rather than dramatized struggle. The final realization feels rushed and convenient, with the epiphany explained to the reader rather than earned through a high-pressure choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist fits the "tortured artist" archetype comfortably but lacks specific, contradictory interiority; his motivation is dream-driven rather than agency-driven. The final choice to take the hand feels inevitable rather than a hard-won resolution of conflicting desires, lowering the dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias possesses a distinct, promising trait ("mundane clairvoyance"), but he remains a passive witness to the Pilgrim's actions rather than a driver of the plot. His stated gift "fails him" at the critical moment, reinforcing a lack of agency that weakens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on expository labels ("reactively visionary") rather than dramatized psychological friction. While her goal is established, her emotional reaction to the climax feels somewhat generic, lacking a distinct, embodied counter-impulse or specific personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer, but he functions more as a vessel for the plot than an agent with internal conflict. His motivation is clear, but he faces no genuine hesitation or contradictory impulses; the "choice" at the end feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or renunciation of a competing value.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist's defining trait of "skepticism" functions as a label rather than a deeply held worldview; it dissolves instantly upon the first sign of magic without genuine struggle. The emotional arc feels unearned because Elias faces no internal resistance or difficult choices, acting merely as a passive observer who accepts the supernatural immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover what happens after goodbye") is abstract and stated rather than deeply dramatized through behavior. Her internal state relies on summary ("bored immortal," "acheingly profound") rather than embodied emotion or complex micro-choices. The antagonist functions as a standard mirror-image rival without distinct interiority or surprising tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer; his struggle between his mother’s con-artist legacy and his desire for a quiet life creates immediate, legible internal friction. His decision to hand over the pot feels earned by this specific internal architecture, shifting him from observer to accomplice. The "math with a human face" worldview effectively anchors his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an observational vessel for the prompt’s themes rather than a distinct agent; his interiority relies on abstract assertions ("collect textures") rather than embodied desire. Motivation is stated but not dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. The emotional arc resolves into unearned peace without a demonstrated psychological shift or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear, melancholic interiority that drives the narrative. The shift from resistance to acceptance (Earned Stasis) is credible, though his passivity in the opening sequence and reliance on summary for his &quot;magpie&quot; habit keep the agency in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s defining trait—skepticism—evaporates instantly upon the first supernatural event, lacking the resistance or internal struggle expected of a professional myth-buster. The transition from cynic to believer feels unearned, as he accepts the visions as truth without applying his established deductive methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") and summary rather than dramatized action. Lan’s traits are asserted by the narrator—we are told she is "quick with a knife"—but we do not see her make a difficult, cost-laden choice in a specific scene. The internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is described as a burden but does not force a tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is consistent but functions more as a vessel for observation than a character under pressure; his internal state relies on "poetic" tropes ("poets and lovers") rather than contradictory impulses. The lack of a difficult, active choice leaves him somewhat static, with agency limited to a predetermined task.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on the "wise blind artisan" trope without generating internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Elias’s confidence is static, and his relationship with Mara lacks friction or distinct status dynamics. The emotional arc is flat, moving from steady competence to validated competence without a moment of doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's mandated trait ("dry-witted") is stated in exposition but contradicts her earnest, mystical dialogue and behavior; the characterization relies on labeling rather than dramatization. Her epiphany regarding the condensation feels like a convenience of plot rather than a deduction derived from her cartographic skills, weakening the agency behind the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who functions smoothly within the plot but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. While his actions are purposeful, he faces no difficult micro-choices that reveal character depth or demand a personal cost, leaving him emotionally static.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is a functional protagonist with a clear external goal and a defined internal burden (loneliness/mother's gift). The motivation to sacrifice the vial is earned by the setup, though the transition from professional salvage to mystical offering relies heavily on the sudden ghostly exposition rather than deep character agency. The emotional arc works but feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a compelling vessel for the premise, and his backstory informs his actions well. However, his interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("thread the labyrinth") rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader slightly from the visceral cost of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora creates little pressure herself; she is a passive recipient of the bead and the resulting memory. The "sister, once, or her lover, or perhaps both" phrasing reads as non-committal hedging rather than earned ambiguity, diluting the specific emotional stakes of the betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora serves as a vessel for imagery rather than a driven agent; her motivation ("from ruin to reverence") is abstract and thematic rather than concrete. Interiority relies heavily on simile ("like a splinter") instead of embodied emotion, and she accepts the voice's challenge without struggle or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a determined returnee, and his agency drives the plot physically (digging, placing the relic). However, internal conflict is minimal; his certainty ("I knew better") lowers tension, and the emotional arc resolves through summarized realization ("I understood then") rather than a difficult, dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s interiority regarding his profession and the clipboard is established well, but the climax relies on a stock character moment. The mother’s dialogue ("You always were too clever for your own good") is a cliché that flattens her into a stereotype rather than a specific individual. The final realization ("searching for his own [name]") feels thematically imposed rather than organically earned by the scene’s action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.5)
    Liora acts as a functional archetype rather than a specific individual. Her motivation is stated ("listen for unheard stories") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or internal obstacles. The transition from "no fighter" to revolutionary leader occurs without psychological friction or cost, resulting in a character who feels like a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s internal conflict is legible and her motivation to find resolution is clear, driving the scene effectively. However, the interiority occasionally leans into abstract labeling ("shape of her regret," "what you fear most") rather than purely embodied emotion. The transition from bitterness to acceptance feels slightly rushed but is earned by the interaction with the apparition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.3)
    Lena observes rather than acts, her agency submerged by the anesthetic and the magical pull of the object. The trait "shrewdly innocent" is an oxymoronic label told in flashback rather than a dramatized behavior that shapes a choice. Her motivation is reactive—answering a "siren's song"—rather than driven by a distinct, active desire.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a distinct character; her motivation is declared ("lodged in her chest like a splinter") rather than demonstrated through costly choices. The transition from longing to satisfaction is linear, lacking the internal contradiction or resistance required for higher bands. The "knowledge network" backstory feels inserted to explain the magic rather than characterizing her specific worldview or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a functional protagonist whose specific trait ("methodically playful") effectively drives the pivotal choice to engage with the anomaly rather than report it. However, his internal landscape is somewhat overshadowed by the external weirdness; while his shift from seeking certainty to accepting the impossible is the core arc, the emotional texture of that surrender relies more on somatic shorthand ("ragged gasps") than complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Quill relies on "rogue" archetypes ("grin that had charmed more than a few gatekeepers") rather than specific interiority. Elias's motivation is clearly stated in dialogue ("stand guard over your own spark") rather than emerging solely through the pressure of the choice. The dynamic works, but the characterization leans on "telling" traits rather than showing them in friction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a coherent archetype (the mourning artist), and his internal state is legible. However, his agency is low; the pivotal shift (beginning to write) is triggered by an external environmental cue (the breeze/lullaby) rather than a hard, active choice made under pressure. The resolution feels granted by the setting rather than wrung from the character's will, limiting the emotional weight of the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    Liora is a functional protagonist whose interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied reaction. While her dedication is clear, her motivation remains somewhat abstract, and she lacks the internal contradiction or interpersonal friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara has a clear goal and professional competence, but her interiority relies heavily on somatic clichés ("pulse quickened," "breath hitched") rather than specific psychological nuance. The "reckless" attribute is a stated label that doesn't fully manifest in a risky on-page choice beyond the basic plot requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's central conflict (harmonizing values) is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through pressure or difficult choices. The resolution comes from external permission (the letter) rather than an internal change or cost paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s compulsion to map dust motes to predict his past feels more like a literary conceit than a grounded psychological reality, creating a slight distance. While his internal conflict between hiding and engagement is clear, the transition from musicologist to pigeon trainer reads as quirky backstory rather than lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s internal state is clearly rendered, and his motivation (finding Mira) drives the scene. However, the shift from desperate search to peaceful acceptance feels hastened by the brevity, relying on a retrospective epiphany ("He understood, then") rather than a pressurized decision made in the moment. The emotional realization is slightly diagnostic, summarizing his growth rather than fully dramatizing the cost of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; his desire for belonging is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. He functions as a cipher to advance the plot, with no meaningful behavioral flaws or distinct voice to ground the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Liora acts as a vessel for abstract themes rather than a grounded character; her title &quot;sea-foam recollectionist&quot; appears as an unearned label disconnected from the cave setting. Her emotional pivot at the end feels like a soft reset, lacking the on-page struggle or cost required to earn a change in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear, but the "analytical" trait is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through problem-solving; her key action (tossing the chess piece) reads as intuitive or magical rather than calculated. The lack of internal conflict or genuine obstacles flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.3)
    Liora's pivotal choice in the climax is driven by the magical prop ("moonstone speck... spontaneously anchored") rather than her own agency, weakening the character arc. The connection with the man is instantaneous and lacks earned emotional weight, relying on a shared "exile" status that feels declared rather than developed.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a passive protagonist who observes rather than acts; he follows the dream and then the old woman’s instructions without resistance or internal conflict. His defining trait ("reads between the lines") is stated in exposition rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice. The "chosen one" status conferred by the woman ("they say you see things") is unearned by on-page behavior. There is no contradictory impulse or felt cost to his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear backstory, but his characterization relies on familiar tropes (itching scars, the weary healer). The "gently skilled" attribute is told rather than shown through complex maneuvering, and his internal conflict is quickly set aside for the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") and lacks a concrete, embodied struggle or conflicting impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions primarily as a passive observer defined by abstract labels ("legacy's burden") rather than embodied complexity; his interiority is summarized through "told" traits rather than dramatized via contradictory impulses or costly micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.7)
    Liora serves as a functional focalizer, but her interiority relies on abstract spiritual labels ("grace," "borrowed heartbeat") rather than embodied emotion or specific personal stakes. The interaction with the watchman is low-friction and utilizes stock dialogue ("You're still here," "So are you") that fails to reveal distinct character traits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora is a functional archetype but lacks specific, embodied interiority beyond the generic "tired peacekeeper" trope. The relationship dynamics are static because Kessar arrives already converted, removing the need for Liora to navigate actual resistance or status shifts in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation pivots on a logical contradiction that undermines the premise. He creates a drought specifically to preserve an acoustic echo, yet abruptly decides that returning the rivers will also sustain that echo ("in the rustle of reeds"), rendering his original, massive engineering effort seemingly pointless rather than a tragic necessity. The "secretly sentimental" trait is told via the sister backstory but the connection to the sudden reversal feels tenuous and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist is idealized as a "temple" without on-page flaws or genuine struggle. Her internal conflict is abstract; the obstacles (threads) yield to simple memories without forcing difficult choices or costs, resulting in a "press X to win" progression.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora is established through adjectives ("urbane," "serene") and exposition rather than revealed through choice under pressure. Her composure never cracks, and her internal conflict with her brother's critique is resolved by a reaffirmation of her existing beliefs, resulting in no character change or emotional cost. The motivation is stated explicitly ("Her motivation was simple") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies on expository definition ("She was an esoteric realist, which meant...") rather than behavior; Liora acts as a passive vessel for the theme without distinct internal friction or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.1)
    The protagonist's internal arc is contradictory: the narrative states he arrived "after forgiving himself," yet the climax claims he feels the weight ease "for the first time" since the event. This confuses the emotional timeline. Additionally, the specific skill set of a "lost wax caster" is mentioned but abandoned for weaving, creating a disconnect between character definition and action.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("foresight," "hindsight") rather than demonstrated traits in action. The protagonist's motivation is purely thematic ("to transcend the directive"), lacking embodied urgency or personal stakes. The interaction with the dream-woman is symbolic and functional, offering little insight into Elias as a specific human being.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Nabu-sharru’s frugality is brilliantly repurposed from a mere habit into a spiritual mechanic ("devotion is encrypted in your frugality"), grounding the magic in character-specific traits. His motivation evolves convincingly on the page, shifting from a desire for control to an acceptance of preservation, with the internal logic of his "necessity" driving the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's "scheming" nature is asserted via label ("scheming pacifist") rather than demonstrated through complex tactics or manipulation in the scene. The emotional arc resolves too neatly; the shift from deep-seated resentment to pity and release hinges on a convenient backstory reveal—that the antagonist was actually a savior—rather than a difficult internal struggle with the unforgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist fits the fable archetype well, but the shift from "too practical" to dream-chaser happens without sufficient on-page resistance or internal struggle. The emotional realization at the summit ("not possession, but trust") reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a psychological shift forged by the pressure of the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora is clearly drawn, but her primary motivation ("to bridge generational wisdom") is delivered via narrator exposition rather than arising from a pressured choice. The internal conflict regarding her daughter is poignant but static; the interaction with the girl lacks the friction or "feistiness" needed to force a deeper vulnerability or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.5)
    The curator functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s concepts rather than a living agent under pressure. Her emotional shift in the tub feels like a calculated plot requirement rather than an embodied reaction, and the internal struggle is resolved too easily by a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's motivation pivots abruptly to a rescue mission mid-scene, feeling like a functional insert rather than organic characterization. The trait "carefully resourceful" appears as a static label and a clumsy adjective modifying "heart" at the climax, rather than being demonstrated through complex decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for the setting rather than a fully realized character; his motivation is clear but his interiority relies on abstract labels ("unkindled solace") rather than embodied emotion. The revelation that the twins are a "choice" reads as a thematic assertion rather than a decision earned through on-page struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    Liora is a functional protagonist who drives the action, but her internal landscape is thin. The prompt trait "warmly methodical" is stated but overridden by her intuitive, effortless mastery of the magical rope, reducing the sense of struggle or character-specific problem solving. She lacks a meaningful flaw or internal contradiction; her decision to archive the truth meets no internal resistance, making the arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ryn is a functional protagonist with clear motivation defined by her role. However, she lacks internal contradiction or a "crucible" of conflicting desires; her transition from mapkeeper to silence-binder is a linear response to external threats rather than a result of idiosyncratic character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias is a distinct presence with clear motivation, but his central trait ("retrocognitively blessed") is delivered via clunky exposition rather than action. The internal logic of this trait conflicts with his reaction at the climax (seeing a light now vs. seeing "what was"), creating a confusing character beat regarding whether his hope is real or a delusion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is distinct but slightly diagnostic in her self-conception ("sculpting her identity"). Her motivation ("preemptively nostalgic") drives the plot, though interiority leans on essayistic summary over visceral feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under pressure; her motivation ("defy the gravity of hopelessness") is abstract and not tested by contradictory impulses or difficult choices in the scene. The shift from defiance to remembrance feels mandated by the plot rather than earned through internal struggle or specific character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interiority is consistent, but the "warmly observant" trait relies heavily on explicit labeling rather than purely dramatized behavior in high-stakes moments. The shift from avoidance to confrontation is legible, but the epiphany ("texture of time") feels slightly diagnostic rather than viscerally earned through the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s internal conflict between claustrophobia and the urge for expansion is drawn with visceral specificities ("walls pressed in like ribs"). Her choice to ascend and the reconfiguration of her relationship to the doll show clear agency and psychological progression. The moment she accepts the role of protector marks a distinct shift in character stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias functions primarily as a "wise ferryman" trope, existing to dispense thematic insight rather than navigate a personal crucible. The emotional progression feels convenient, with the passenger's tension resolving instantly upon his intervention without earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Veyra functions as a plot device rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a crucible of choice. The defining trait "wisely adventurous" is asserted via a remembered quote rather than dramatized through a high-stakes trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype (the reclusive healer) defined by backstory rather than present-moment complexity. The repeated epithet "tender shadow keeper" distances the reader, and her swift capitulation to the child lacks internal struggle or contradictory impulses acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's motivation, rooted in the specific regret of the pyramid scheme, is compelling and grounds the fantastic elements. However, the trait "virtuously mischievous" is told rather than shown; his final action (teaching others) reads more as protective/altruistic than mischievous, making that specific tag feel like an orphaned prompt requirement rather than an integrated character driver.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation was simple") rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices. Elias functions as a vessel for the magical apparatus, displaying no internal conflict or distinct agency beyond turning a handle when a "muse" prompts him. The emotional reaction to his family’s erasure is generic ("breath hitched"), lacking specific, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aldric is largely passive, following a vague "pull" and reacting to the woman's exposition rather than driving the scene through internal desire. His silence is a stated trait rather than an active constraint in the interaction, and the final choice feels like compliance with the guide rather than a desperate, character-specific bid.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("broken-hearted," "magnify small kindnesses") rather than dramatized choice. The "lost love" backstory is mentioned but does not exert pressure on the present action. His motivation is stated in exposition rather than emerging from a struggle with high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira functions as a competent but standard archetype of the "gritty resistance survivor." While her motivation is clear, her interiority relies on familiar tropes ("drifter with too many questions") rather than specific, contradictory character traits. The emotional arc is serviceable but lacks the deep, idiosyncratic friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions as a vehicle for the ritual rather than a character with conflicting desires. His motivation is clear but static; he arrives, performs, and leaves without a moment of doubt or a dramatized choice that carries visible weight. The internal cost is stated in summary ("something taken") rather than embodied in a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora is a passive protagonist who observes rather than acts; her primary development occurs via a dream sequence that happens to her, bypassing agency. The text lacks the internal struggle or contradictory impulses required for a 600-800 word piece to land with psychological weight. She accepts the "transformation" without a moment of doubt or cost, making her feel more like a fairytale archetype than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is stated rather than embodied; the shift from "chasing precision" to "befriending uncertainty" occurs via narrative assertion rather than dramatized struggle. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("weight of his uncertainty") instead of concrete, visceral experience. The protagonist receives the ending rather than earning it through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s motivation is stated in summary ("to understand the weight of names") rather than dramatized through resistance or conflicting desires. Her interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("grief was a blunt instrument") that distance the reader from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated clearly in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle. His transition from burdened to healed feels unearned, as he receives the resolution without making a difficult choice or facing a character-defining test.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is distinct, but his agency dissolves at the climax; he accepts a solution (the vial) offered by a convenient stranger rather than wrestling answers from the setting or his own psyche. The "Calculator" persona feels slightly thin, and the "proprioceptively enhanced" trait is told rather than demonstrated through a high-stakes physical cost or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora functions primarily as a stable viewpoint for the concept rather than a character under pressure; her motivation is stated ("simple: to honor...") rather than dramatized through conflict. She lacks internal contradiction or distinct blind spots, and her journey is a smooth accumulation of knowledge without the friction of difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear role, but her interiority relies on familiar urban fantasy tropes ("ghosts didn't care about union hours"). Her emotional arc is relatively flat; the "weight" lifting at the end feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult on-page choice or significant personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character. His pivotal emotional shift—abandoning his life's work of "compressing eternity" upon seeing frost patterns—feels unearned and abrupt, lacking the internal friction or struggle expected at this level. The "cryptic letterpress operator" role is largely aesthetic until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence with coherent interiority, though his "revolutionary" backstory feels more like a label than a driving force until the end. The dynamic with Liora relies on a standard "believer vs. skeptic" archetype, which limits the complexity of their interaction. The emotional progression is logical, moving from defensive nostalgia to active reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    Internal conflict is summarized via abstract labels ("wilting near dishonesty") rather than dramatized through action. The protagonist's shift from hesitation to resolution feels unearned by the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias observes the horrific (undead grandfather) with detached curiosity rather than embodied emotion, reducing him to a passive witness. The "sensibly eccentric" trait is told rather than shown through resistance or specific behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a passive protagonist who observes rather than drives action; his defining trait ("perpetually learning") is used to justify a lack of inquiry ("didn’t question it") rather than fueling agency. There is no internal conflict or hesitation about leaving his world, making the final decision feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract obsession rather than embodied struggle; her motivation ("reckon with something") lacks visceral cost or competing on-page impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a plot device equipped with convenient supernatural tools (retrocognition) rather than a character with psychological depth. Her "trembling" and "squinting" are stock gestures, and her internal life is replaced by external exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is clearly defined as a stubborn visionary, and his motivation to reject pity is established early. However, the internal arc lacks friction; his shift from frustration to success is summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined largely by his role ("venerable oath scribe") rather than specific, embodied choices under pressure. The interiority relies on summary and stated realizations ("He understood then") rather than the friction of contradictory impulses or doubt. The shift to the action-movie cliché "just getting started" at the end undermines the contemplative persona established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    Liora's motivation ("needed to know the texture") drives the scene, but her internal struggle is minimal. The emotional arc moves smoothly from curiosity to epiphany without checking a distinct flaw or forcing a difficult choice. The realization at the end feels slightly unearned, relying on abstract assertions of "promise" rather than dramatized character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora’s motivation is legible, but her reaction to the climax—doubling down on the method that nearly destroyed the village—lacks sufficient psychological processing on the page. The transition from "nearly cost her everything" to "she would not stop" feels like unearned stasis rather than a complex acceptance of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype with interiority that relies on lyrical abstraction rather than specific, embodied emotion. Motivation is delivered via diagnostic telling ("To find strength in vulnerability was his motivation") rather than dramatized choice or cost. This label-speak flattens the character's complexity into a prompt response.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is legible and the arc from refusal to action is complete, but the protagonist’s "covenant" is established via summary rather than dramatized struggle. Interiority is occasionally distant or filter-heavy ("Elias felt," "Elias understood"), keeping the emotional cost of his silence abstract until the final tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated ("needed to rediscover") rather than felt through specific resistance or dilemma. The emotional arc relies on a dream figure delivering exposition that Elias accepts instantly, lacking the internal struggle or skepticism required to make his acceptance of the "curse" feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mira functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her grief is stated ("coiled around her ribs") rather than dramatized through resistance or friction. Her epiphany feels unearned, arriving via scenic observation rather than an internal struggle or difficult choice. The transition from sorrow to hope is passive, relying on the environment to solve her emotional state without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer, but his motivation is delivered through abstract summary ("foster interspecies respect") rather than dramatized choice. The disconnect between his "brazen calm" and the futility of his actions (starting a multi-year process one week before destruction) reads more as denial than the intended wisdom, blurring the character's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist’s transition from skepticism to belief occurs with minimal resistance or dramatized struggle, making the internal arc feel unearned. While the interiority is legible ("weight of his own skepticism"), the lack of a difficult choice or behavioral cost flattens the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with contradictory impulses; his internal state is summarized ("had no illusions") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The "coachman" identity is a label that does not inform his skills or perspective, leaving his gardening actions feeling disconnected from his established role.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias embodies a standard "weary veteran" archetype with trauma ("hands began to shake") that remains decorative, never actively obstructing his packing or decision-making. The transition from avoidance to action is swift and linear; the inciting voice prompts immediate compliance rather than a dramatized struggle against his established fear.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("blessed pariah," "relic") and summarized backstory rather than active struggle. The climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("confusion became clarity, when fear became curiosity") instead of embodied emotion or decisive action, violating the "show, don't tell" standard for peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lirien fits the "chivalrous thief" archetype well, but her agency falters at the climax when she receives the reward despite failing the test. Interiority relies on standard somatic markers ("pulse quickening," "stomach dropped") rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's motivation is declared in summary ("wants to be the historian") rather than dramatized through pressure, and her "crisis actor" background informs interiority but does not clearly shape her tactical choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a passive vessel for imagery rather than an active protagonist; his motivation ("understand the shape of home") is abstract and driven by "dream logic" rather than character-defining choices under pressure. The "mercury-glass seer" trait colors the narration but does not distinctively shape his tactics or interactions beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is anchored effectively by the physical motif of "productive fidgeting," which externalizes Elias's internal unrest. The transition to stillness at the closure earns the internal shift, though the realization relies heavily on an external projection (Liora) rather than a purely active choice, keeping the score from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira’s characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("defiant artist," "price of forgiveness") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. The internal conflict is articulated through "therapy-speak" interiority ("hollow ache," "mend broken souls") rather than embodied emotion or difficult choices. While her final decision to reject the ritual is motivated, it feels like a low-cost shift aided by a helpful guide rather than a hard-won internal victory.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation ("conjure meaning") remains abstract and summary-based rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The protagonist's internal conflict is resolved by an external magical correspondence rather than a change in stance or renunciation, and the emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("feared," "despair") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    Character motivation is anchored in a clear, specific past promise, driving the narrative forward effectively. The internal landscape of "regret in his bones" is evocative, though slightly reliant on summary labels rather than purely dramatized behavior. The shift from panic to the creative act at the end is a strong character beat, earning the resolution through a specific capability (painting).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is legible, but Elias’s interiority relies on stock idioms ("knew in his bones") rather than specific psychological texture. Maren functions primarily as a standard skeptical foil without deeper agency or relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias functions as an archetype—the weary wanderer defined by accessories (frayed coat, censer)—rather than a specific psychology under pressure. His motivation is abstract ("geography of loss"), and he obeys the inciting call without hesitation or cost, leaving his inner life undramatized by difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Internal conflict is clear, but the motivation relies on diagnostic label-speak ("cultivating psychological safety") rather than embodied desire. The protagonist's defining trait ("involuntarily truthful") is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized in interaction, limiting its visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias is a vessel for the events rather than an agent of them; his acceptance of the supernatural memory transfer is instantaneous, lacking the internal friction or skepticism that would define a grounded character. The trait "eccentric" is not dramatized; he appears merely solitary and routine-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.7)
    Character motivation is summarized rather than dramatized; the shift from burden to abandonment feels slightly unearned by the on-page struggle. Agency is low until the final moment, as he follows the ants "without thinking" rather than through active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her journey lacks genuine internal or external resistance; the transformation feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The "softly commanding" nature is told in summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices under pressure. The emotional arc is linear, resolving in acceptance without a moment of doubt that creates stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s internal state is legible, but her conflict regarding Elias’s return resolves with minimal resistance, reducing the weight of her final choice. The emotional cost of trusting him is stated ("fingers trembled") rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off or hesitation that endangers the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, internalized protagonist with a compelling specific emotion (jealousy of his past self). His motivation to "distill chaos" is clear, and the internal conflict between resentment and the desire for answers is well-drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias is defined primarily by backstory (loss of smell) rather than active desire in the present. His connection to Clara relies on a high-risk coincidence (sharing a name with her grandmother’s lost patient) rather than organic interplay, which makes the emotional pivot feel unearned by character agency. The interiority is lyrical but functional, serving the theme more than a specific psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora's interiority is consistent, but her emotional arc relies on "therapy-speak" realizations ("scars... were stories now") rather than embodied struggle. The shift from frustration to acceptance feels abrupt, catalyzed by a convenient memory rather than a difficult active choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a compelling backstory ("gossip-column exorcist"), and his guilt drives the narrative effectively. However, his internal journey resolves somewhat neatly through the realization that "miracles are about listening," which feels more like a thematic convenient conclusion than an earned psychological shift under pressure. The transition from technical preparation to emotional release is functional but lacks the grit of a harder-won battle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a living character; her internal landscape is composed of abstract metaphors ("ghost," "syllable of time") rather than grounded emotion or specific memory. The transition from witness to weaver is a role shift, not a personal transformation earned through struggle or decision. Her motivation is stated in high concepts without a felt, human-scale cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist whose competence drives the plot, but he lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses required for higher bands; his motivation is singular (fix the clock). The micro-choice to sacrifice blood is earned by the setup, but his internal landscape is relatively linear.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias lacks agency, functioning as a passive recipient of Mara's exposition rather than a protagonist driving the scene with distinct skills. His acceptance of Mara’s invasive backstory (planting spores in his shoes) lacks credible emotional friction or skepticism, making the characterization feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a compelling internal contradiction (academic discipline vs. gambler’s instinct). However, her pivotal shift in perspective is triggered by an external prop (the hidden ink) rather than an earned internal breaking point, which slightly dilutes the agency of her final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s internal contradiction—seeking "cultivated estrangement" while acting as a "metronome for grief"—creates a compelling, specific psychological profile. Her shift from enabling the callers' loops to accepting their departure is a subtle but earned evolution in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal arc relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels convenient and intellectualized, lacking the embodied resistance that would make the final renunciation feel earned. The transition from holding on to letting go happens without sufficient on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is clear, but the "desperately jocular" trait is largely told rather than dramatized, appearing only in one brief interaction. The protagonist's internal shift feels slightly rushed, relying on a sudden therapeutic realization rather than a struggle earned through the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Liora displays strong sensory embodiment, but her agency is passive; she follows the compass and music without facing a difficult choice. The climax relies on diagnostic interiority ("song of her grief, her longing") rather than dramatized emotional struggle, reducing character complexity to labels.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is distinct, detailing her burden of "wrong seeds" with specific emotional weight. However, the secondary character (Elias) functions primarily as a supportive thematic prompt rather than applying pressure to the "relationship crucible," which softens the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on direct labeling ("quietly charismatic") rather than demonstrated action. The relationship is static and frictionless; Elias functions only as a mirror to validate Lena, lacking independent agency or conflicting desires. There is no internal contradiction or cost to Lena's actions, resulting in a flat emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara’s decision to switch allegiance occurs instantly ("Then let me help") without visible internal struggle or earned trust, trivializing her three-year pursuit. The phrase "analytically intuitive mind" is a diagnostic label that tells rather than shows her competence. The antagonist's transition from menacing arsonist to romanticized liberator lacks sufficient friction to feel credible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation to remember Liora is clear and poignant, driving the narrative focus. However, Elias's physical agency is undermined by the unearned escape sequence where restraints simply "snap" and he moves without memory, reducing the struggle. The final merging of identities is a bold character choice, though the path to reach it lacks resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a grounded protagonist with clear, job-specific interiority ("nervous flipping," "teeth ache"). His obsession with the labyrinth's sentience is well-motivated by the backstory of the coin, though the "woman in yellow" functions more as a plot device than a fully realized counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maris functions as a static archetype (the wise mystic) rather than a contested character; she faces no internal contradiction, and the interaction lacks the friction or risk required to reveal depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias is a distinct, competent protagonist whose chess-coach persona convincingly filters his perception ("searching for the move," "pieces felt heavier"). While his motivation is clear, it relies heavily on summarized backstory and reflective exposition rather than active dramatization in the present moment. The "grief wasn't a game" internal monologue feels slightly platitudinous, though his final action provides a necessary beat of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lirien is a passive observer of her own epiphany; the resolution relies on diagnostic dialogue ("stop fighting what you are") rather than a dramatized choice under pressure. Her internal conflict is asserted rather than shown through contradictory desires or costly actions.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent, embodied focalizer, and his "performance" of grief provides a compelling internal logic. However, the connection between the "happiness mandate" backstory and his current interiority feels slightly explanatory rather than fully dramatized in the present moment. The internal conflict is clear, but his agency is largely static (endurance) until the final resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is abstract ("tremor of certainty") and lacks embodied urgency or contradiction. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for description than an agent making difficult choices with visible costs. The internal state is consistent but summarized rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias creates a clear focal point, but his internal arc resolves too easily through external magical intervention rather than genuine struggle. The shift from frustration to mastery relies on a sudden epiphany granted by Liora rather than an earned evolution of his disability or skill.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is abstract ("discover the texture of connection") and lacks embodied urgency, resulting in a character who observes and reflects rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The lack of internal contradiction or visible cost makes Elias feel more like a thematic vessel than a living protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a largely reactive protagonist who follows a breadcrumb trail of instructions rather than driving the narrative through active choices. His "rock bottom" state is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized in the present. While his grief is tangible, the resolution (healing) feels unearned by his own agency, relying instead on an external vision to prompt the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira is a distinct presence with specific details (onyx-ink stains), and her shift from observer to participant is well-charted. However, her interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("a trait that had both saved and doomed her"), and the emotional landscape feels slightly performed rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on stated labels ("saffron-veil historian") rather than dramatized depth. The emotional pivot at the climax—abandoning a decade's obsession because a ghost child says "let go"—feels unearned and lacks internal resistance or visible psychological cost. Elara functions more as a camera for the setting than an agent with complex, contradictory drives.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is legible, but Elias faces no genuine internal contradiction or difficult choice; his success feels inevitable and low-cost. The character tag ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") feels like an inserted label rather than an organic trait demonstrated through unique action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is handled through diagnostic label-speak ("He’d been too soft," "believed in the quiet strength") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The internal realization feels expository and neat, lacking the messy contradiction of genuine emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is introspective and sensory-focused but largely passive, driven by external signals (plants, the tower) rather than active agency. The shift from a motivation to "read scars" to reading coffee rings feels like a convenient substitution rather than an earned evolution of his character arc. The "accidental telepathy" is told rather than dramatized through conflict, functioning mainly as a plot device to move him between scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is a functional vessel for the premise but lacks deep internal conflict or resistance. Her desire is stated ("searching for their tune") rather than dramatized through struggle or sacrifice, and her success feels inevitable rather than earned by character-specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist relies on the "moonstruck dreamer" label rather than demonstrated complexity; her struggle is summarized in backstory ("trapped for months") rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the scene. The resolution—a sudden influx of magical inspiration—bypasses genuine character agency or psychological cost, resulting in a passive vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency; his primary action is obeying a disembodied voice that explains his new destiny. He is explicitly described as "immune" to the setting's dangers, which neutralizes tension and removes the necessity for protective tactics or struggle. The shift from freight guard to cosmic guardian is instantaneous and unearned, missing the internal conflict or resistance that creates character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist acts as a passive vessel for the concept rather than a fully realized character. His "sudden knowing" and blind following of the "wild frontier" replace genuine motivation or internal conflict, and he faces no difficult choices that reveal character; the "guardian" explains his internal state to him.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is largely passive, defined by a backstory summary rather than active choices in the scene; her primary action (stamping the air) is symbolic and low-stakes. Elias functions as a standard "wise guide" archetype without individual friction or distinct flaws. The motivation ("unused courage") remains abstract and declared rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is distinct with his silent communication and physical sensitivity, but the "nerve regeneration" is stated rather than felt in the action; he moves with "precision of a metronome" rather than the promised agony/numbness trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    Liora is a competent but static archetype whose defining qualification ("unbroken") is asserted as backstory rather than tested by the scene. She faces no internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choice, resulting in a functional protagonist who lacks depth or development.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on stock physical cues (“unease coiling”) rather than deep contradiction. The tapping habit creates a functional setup for the ending but feels more like a plot device than an embodied trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.6)
    Lira is a coherent focalizer with established roots (grandmother/stargazing), but her internal state is largely delivered through exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The trait "awkwardly confident" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through interaction or difficult choice. The final action—touching the stone—feels like a destiny fulfilled rather than a hard-won decision with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mira functions as a coherent archetype (rebel elder) but lacks embodied contradiction; her motivation is declared ("never been one for rules") rather than dramatized through a difficult, high-cost choice. The "destiny" aspect reduces her agency to following instructions rather than grappling with a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s internal conflict between trauma and endurance is compelling, and her resistance to "healing" adds depth. However, the emotional shift relies heavily on a montage ("Days blurred into weeks") rather than dramatized micro-choices, and Mira functions more as a thematic guide than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("to descend into the necessary darkness") rather than dramatized through behavior, creating a distance between reader and character. The shift from despair to the calculated "redesign" of the cards feels abrupt and therapeutic rather than emotionally earned by the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elias is defined by labels ("albino," "tracker," "consciously wild") rather than embodied complexity, and his internal state is summarized ("curiosity gnawed") rather than shown through friction. The transition to "serene anger" feels unearned by the scene's action, and he faces no difficult dilemma or personal cost to drive the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but characterization relies heavily on labels and summary ("bravely conflicted," "accustomed to preserving") rather than embodied action. The protagonist's internal struggle is stated conceptually ("fear the silence") rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.5)
    The antagonist's ruthless nature is established but contradicted instantly when he abandons his goal for a sentimental gesture, creating a soft character arc that lacks credibility. Liora's interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("senselessly perceptive nature") rather than dramatized insight. The emotional resolution feels unearned by the characters' prior established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael functions as a stoic vessel for the ritual rather than a fully realized character. His skepticism ("didn't believe in omens") is stated in backstory but contradicted immediately by his actions without on-page struggle or decision cost. The "cool-headed" trait serves as a label rather than a tested quality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is a distinct, motivated protagonist whose transition from heiress to astronomer feels grounded in the narrative. Her interiority is vivid, though it occasionally leans into stylized noir tropes ("silent accusation") rather than embodied emotion. The motivation to preserve her father's legacy drives the plot effectively, culminating in a clear, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—silence versus guilt—is compelling, and the shift from avoidance to integration is clear. However, the backstory of the "constellation tattooist by necessity" feels slightly abstract, and the emotional pivot at the climax relies on a rapid acceptance of the ritual that feels closer to symbolic shorthand than a fully earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, though her "socially perceptive" trait is delivered via exposition rather than dramatized interaction. Maren serves primarily as a foil to trigger the realization, and her rapid shift from critic to ally feels slightly convenient. The internal cost—trembling hands, the weight of secrets—is embodied well.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between vengeance and mercy drives the narrative. However, the characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("gentle radical", "heart a quiet furnace") rather than purely dramatized behavior. The "arms of steel" line, while prompt-mandated, feels melodramatic and jarring within her internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias functions primarily as a facilitator for the ghost's arc rather than a conflicted protagonist; his lack of internal doubt or contradictory impulses makes him feel static. The synesthesia is introduced via expository labels ("blessed—or cursed") rather than being integrated into a dilemma that forces a difficult choice. While the relationship with Liora is tender, the emotional weight is carried almost entirely by her, leaving Elias as a confident operator of a magic system rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s definition as an "affectionate skeptic" provides a solid anchor, and the final callback ("Prove it") attempts a resonant reconfiguration of this trait. However, her rapid transition from skepticism to mystical acceptance—triggered by a single vision—feels unearned within the short scope. The emotional logic is functional but rushed, lacking the friction of genuine resistance before the surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eira is largely reactive; her shift from being "not ready" to total acceptance ("Eira understood") relies on a sudden epiphany rather than a dramatized struggle or active choice. The interiority relies on abstract labels ("fear and awe tangled") rather than contradictory, embodied impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira functions effectively as a fable archetype, but lacks embodied interiority or conflicting impulses until the final beat. Her emotional detachment ("didn't gasp... didn't even smile") creates a barrier to engagement, treating the climax as a procedural adjustment rather than a human moment of awe or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between forgetting and redemption is clear, and the backstory is integrated efficiently through the file. However, the emotional pivot relies heavily on the convenient discovery of the key rather than an active struggle against his own reluctance. The characterization leans on tropes (scarred spy, pillbox) rather than specific, individualized traits.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is abstract ("distill complexity into essence") and stated rather than dramatized through friction. While the connection to the wife adds depth, the interiority relies on high-level diagnostic labels instead of embodied emotion. The shift to "quiet gratitude" at the climax feels unearned by the preceding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    Ren serves as an observational vessel rather than an active agent; he faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice that tests his character. The defining trait, "phototropic to kindness," operates as a diagnostic label asserted by the narrator rather than a behavior dramatized through struggle or cost. Lacking a flaw or competing desire, his arc is flat and purely reactive to the setting's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on exposition ("wistfully pragmatic," "chasing the luminous promise") rather than demonstrated traits. While the final gesture of giving the tool implies generosity, the internal struggle is minimal, and the emotional shift to "quiet hope" is told rather than embodied in a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic labels ("translating isolation into independence") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The protagonist's internal state is explained through abstractions rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clearly stated, but her internal struggle is resolved primarily by external wisdom (the artist) rather than a difficult choice. The epiphany feels unearned by prior resistance or sacrifice, reading more as a fable-like realization than a character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara is a competent protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction or distinct flaws; her certainty about the "tricksters" removes ambiguity or struggle. Voss serves as a stock skeptic whose resistance is nominal, providing no genuine relational pressure. The emotional arc is linear (anxiety to hope) without the complexity of mixed feelings or costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the internal conflict (claustrophobia) resolves too conveniently ("claustrophobia forgotten") without a dramatized struggle or cost at the climax. The protagonist's traits feel somewhat labeled rather than demonstrated through difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is a passive protagonist who functions primarily as a recipient of exposition; the stranger appears solely to explain the plot and provide the key evidence without Elara having to earn it. While face blindness is mentioned, it is not dramatized as a genuine constraint in the interaction, functioning instead as a label. The dialogue is stiff and functional, lacking the specific interiority or subtext required for a high-stakes literary encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("nervous confidence") and stock gestures ("fingers trembling," "breath hitched") rather than embodied particularity. While Mira's motivation to honor her ancestor is clear, her internal state is told to the reader rather than revealed through complex, contradictory choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is stated abstractly ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") rather than dramatized through conflict or choice. The protagonist observes and remembers but lacks agency or pressure to force a revealing decision; she is a vessel for description rather than an active character. The trait "dynamically observant" is delivered as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult, specific noticing that alters the scene's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is introspective and consistent, and the parallel between his father's robbery and the startup adds depth to his motivation. However, his agency is primarily observational; he watches, touches, and reflects rather than making high-pressure choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his internal arc relies on a convenient epiphany rather than a pressure-tested choice. The realization that he must "share the burden" arrives via a passive vision at midnight rather than through a struggle that forces him to confront his own limitations or flaws on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Veyra is a compelling protagonist with a sharply defined internal conflict between her duty and her guilt. The tension between the Circle's instructions and her own knowledge of the seed's nature demonstrates agency and competence. The moment of confession is earned and carries genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a passive vessel for the prompt's requirements rather than a living character; his primary action is to "heed" a destiny that offers no resistance. Emotion is labeled via diagnostic abstraction ("anxious elation") rather than embodied in physical reaction or conflicting thought. The "visionary" trait is asserted through exposition about his past rather than demonstrated through a unique, pressurized perception of the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s internal conflict between the desire to save her brother and the cost of her memories is palpable and drives the scene. The "Patchwork Girl" identity adds character-specific texture, though "reckless idealism" is told rather than fully dramatized in this short window. The choice to sacrifice the memory is earned and carries visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    Jake’s interiority is distinct, grounded in his specific past as a roadie. However, the secondary character, Lena, functions primarily as a plot device to unlock his emotional stasis rather than applying organic pressure; her arrival is convenient and her insight feels diagnostic rather than earned by interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a plot device rather than a character under pressure; her "kindly methodical" nature is an explicit label not borne out by difficult choices. Internal conflict is absent—her skepticism of souls dissolves instantly upon seeing the ghost-figure, offering no resistance or cost to the narrative arc. The emotional reaction ("heart ached," "eyes stinging") feels unearned and melodramatic given the clinical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is visually distinct, but his motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation was simple...") rather than dramatized through struggle. The titan-gear physiology anchors him effectively, but the choice to release the books feels inevitable rather than a difficult trade-off earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but her emotional pivot from observer to confessor feels convenient and lacks on-page struggle. The realization of her own fear ("afraid of being forgotten") arrives abruptly to resolve the climax rather than emerging from a dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s motivation—seeking atonement through a rigorous, almost punitive cataloging of errors—is distinct and compelling. The physical cost of stopping medication to steady her hands adds a visceral layer to her internal struggle. The shift from seeking forgiveness to accepting truth feels earned by the scene's introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("the dreamer") rather than a specific individual; her interiority is abstract ("moments between knowing and unknowing") rather than embodied. Motivation is stated as a mystical quest but lacks a grounded, personal engine or contradictory impulses. The resolution (being "set free") feels theoretical because the initial constraint ("fate") was never dramatized with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and the final choice is decisive, grounded in the established conflict. However, the "accidentally telepathic" trait is delivered via an expository lump ("a quirk she’d hidden") rather than dramatized behavior, and the antagonist relies on stock descriptors ("eyes were cold").

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.0)
    Liora functions as a competent procedural vehicle rather than a character under pressure; she experiences no internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her motivation is stated explicitly ("to honor the threshold") rather than revealed through difficult choices. The connection between her past as a beautician and her current magic usage is expository rather than integrated into her tactile method in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's heavy backstory (village burning) feels like unearned gravitas unconnected to her present passivity. Her motivation is abstract ("source of joy"), and the climax relies on her listening to a magical voice rather than making a high-pressure psychological choice. The internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias and Veyra are distinct, but their depth is limited by reliance on label-speak ("conscience for hire," "protected vulnerability") rather than dramatic friction. The "cloak of doubt" acting as an internal voice feels like an unearned magical metaphor that externalizes conflict. Elias's shift from auditor to sympathetic listener happens too easily, lacking a visible cost or renunciation of his professional rigidity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on summarized emotion ("afraid of failing," "afraid of succeeding") rather than embodied struggle. The transformation from "researcher" to "girl who believed" feels like a convenient switch rather than a hard-won psychological shift under pressure. The character reads more as a vessel for the concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elias functions as a generic "mystic seeker" archetype rather than a specific individual. He lacks internal contradiction or distinctive interiority; his "weathered resolve" is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The narrative relies on his passive observation, offering no friction between his wants and his environment until the external sign appears.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer, but his epiphany relies heavily on external validation (the figure explaining his nature) rather than a hard-won internal shift. The realization ("slow learner") veers into diagnostic labeling, and his pivotal choice—dropping the satchel—is a compliance with a command rather than an active agency, weakening the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias lacks genuine agency; he is propelled by a magical object and a guide figure rather than internal drive. The "hollow ache" is a diagnostic label rather than embodied emotion, and his sudden belief in the rumors is unmotivated by character logic. The woman functions purely as an exposition device.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels and summary rather than dramatized behavior. The shift from a "roaring fire" to "embers" is told through interior monologue rather than shown through interaction or difficult choice. The moment of emotion ("quietly enthusiastic") appears as an appended label rather than an embodied feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions as a vessel for the ritual rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His motivation is explicitly stated ("That was his motivation") rather than dramatized through conflict, and his weariness reads as a generic reaper trope rather than specific, embodied character work.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's "lukewarm" limitation drives the plot, forcing him to innovate a water-based method rather than relying on standard fire magic. His "naive" attribute is effectively dramatized as the persistence required to attempt an impossible repair, grounding the high-concept stakes in specific character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is largely reactive, following a trail of breadcrumbs laid by an unexplained agent rather than driving the investigation through active agency. His motivation is summarized in exposition ("vigilant... against the rising tide") rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the rising action. The final decision to keep the photos is a clear choice, but it comes after a passive "scavenger hunt" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is consistent, but interiority relies on stock phrasing ("breath she hadn’t realized") and summary rather than embodied, contradictory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("midnight pattern seeker," "attentively inventive") and abstract internal summary rather than demonstrated behavior. The motivation ("preserve trust") feels imposed by the prompt rather than organically arising from the survival situation, creating a disconnect between the immediate physical crisis and the philosophical interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but Kael's internal state relies on generic descriptors ("storm inside him," "void") rather than specific, embodied contradiction. The character feels more like a vessel for the prompt's theme than a distinct individual.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is delivered via explicit telling ("Her motivation crystallized: to safeguard space for innovation") rather than dramatized struggle. The backstory regarding her father appears too late to earn the emotional stakes, feeling like a convenient patch rather than a core driver.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is distinct, but the psychological bridge between his action (leaf blowing) and the emotional result (healing trauma) relies on sentimental assertion rather than grounded character work. The "mournfully eager" internal state is told rather than demonstrated through complex choice, and the family's reaction feels idealized rather than earned by the character's specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation ("make friends with uncertainty") is stated diagnostically rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The "dimensional homesickness" remains a label without specific on-page manifestation beyond the final act of writing. The guardian functions as a standard archetype (riddling guide) rather than a specific character with distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal pivot ("Then the penny dropped") relies on summary and explicit diagnostic labeling ("stoically sensitive") rather than dramatized, embodied struggle. While the shift in motivation is clear, the reliance on self-diagnostic interiority distances the reader from the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is abstract and prompt-driven ("find the beginning in every ending") rather than grounded in character-specific need. The protagonist's pivotal realization is handed to her by an external voice ("The voice was right") rather than earned through internal struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is functionally competent but lacks depth; his "ardent" nature and "resiliently positive" outlook are asserted via labels rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Motivation is generic ("moments like this") and untested by genuine struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias is defined by labels ("fever dream architect") and stated motivation rather than dramatized choice under pressure; he remains largely passive, following the thread's lead without significant resistance or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirien is a competent protagonist with a clear desire, but her journey lacks deep internal friction or visceral cost. Her transition from traditionalist to innovator feels smooth and inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The antagonist, Tael, serves only as a token obstacle who folds immediately, failing to provide the relational pressure needed to test her conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the emotional logic of the final "smile" feels unearned; the leap from tension to beatific acceptance of entrapment relies on a trope rather than dramatized internal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s claustrophobia serves as a tangible, embodied constraint that he actively pushes against, grounding the surreal elements in physical struggle. His final decision "not to join, but to stand by" provides a precise, character-driven moral stance that distinguishes the closure from simple surrender, earning the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is defined primarily by his backstory label ("death certificate error survivor") rather than active choices in the scene. His motivation to "fetch wisdom" renders him passive, waiting for an external entity to resolve his internal conflict without him having to act or sacrifice anything. The emotional arc relies on remembered trauma rather than dramatized struggle in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or a dramatized flaw that complicates her success. Her physical trait ("copper-veined") is purely ornamental and does not influence her choices or the plot. The narrative asserts her competence ("didn't believe in curses") rather than testing it against genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation shifts rapidly from "surviving" to succumbing, relying on the backstory of "bitterness" rather than on-page development to earn the transformation. The "punchline" realization feels like a convenient conceptual leap rather than an emotional inevitability born of the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora's decision to abandon her seven-year vigil is triggered instantly by a found object, lacking the necessary internal struggle or accumulated pressure for such a life-altering choice. Her motivation shifts abruptly from duty to flight without sufficient emotional grounding, and the cost of abandoning the orchard is acknowledged but dismissed without felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jace is a consistent, melancholic figure, and his motivation to preserve the past is clear. However, his interiority relies heavily on summarized emotions ("weight of disputed letters," "promise broken") rather than embodied reactions. The relationship with Mira is functional but lacks the friction or depth of a "crucible" moment; they coexist rather than sparking new character facets off one another.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for the setting's magic rather than an active agent with conflicting desires. His motivation—"to interpret silence as possibility"—is abstract and explicitly stated by the narrator rather than dramatized through difficult choices. There is no internal contradiction or emotional cost; Elias simply accepts the magic without hesitation or human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is functional but passive, following a linear path of plot coupons without internal conflict or hesitation. His "sanely eccentric" nature is explicitly stated as a label but never demonstrated through unique choices or behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is abstract and prompt-driven ("woke with a single word"), lacking internal contradiction or grounded psychological depth. Elias functions as a passive vessel for the imagery rather than an agent making difficult choices with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The locksmith is a functional archetype who performs a procedure without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal stakes. Elara remains passive for the majority of the scene, and her motivation is explained via summary rather than dramatized through complex behavior. There is no embodied cost to the protagonist for unlocking the secret.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation—recovering lost memory—is visceral and drives every beat, grounding the supernatural elements in human longing. His interiority is distinct, though the "chronically curious" attribute feels more like a label for the backstory than a driver of the desperate present-day action. The emotional crescendo at the climax is earned, though the sensory transition into the memory is slightly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer with a compelling physical habit (walking backwards) that grounds her internal state. However, the motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" reads as an abstract summary rather than a lived drive, and the dialogue veers into instructional cliché ("not about never falling") rather than character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    Maren is defined by labels ("wise," "creative") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Her internal state is purely aligned with the plot's needs; she experiences no contradictory impulses, hesitation, or personal cost. The emotion ("heart swelled," "trembling") feels performative and unearned because she faces no genuine struggle or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a compelling protagonist with a specifically drawn internal landscape ("cracks in his own mind"). His transition from restorer to liberator is well-motivated by the backstory of the dreams, creating a strong moral stance under pressure. The defiance against the Fisher King earns the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear internal drive ("methodically curious") that motivates the action. However, the trait of interpreting silence with "empathy" is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through interaction, and the shift from passive framer to breaking iron bars feels slightly hasty given the established temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dr. Voss is a distinct focalizer with a consistent internal voice, but his pivotal choice—releasing the globe—reads as obedience to the ghost's instructions rather than a decision forged by internal pressure. The "Death as a first name" motif frames his perspective well but functions more as a thematic wrapper than a driver of tactical agency.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is a functional protagonist who drives the scene, but his internal landscape feels generic to the "sensitive artist" archetype. The diagnostic dialogue ("You’re encoding your needs") flattens the emotional discovery into label-speak rather than embodied interaction. While his choice to stay in the storm shows agency, the emotional cost is asserted ("eyes stung") rather than deeply dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira is defined largely by narrative labels ("warmly inquisitive") rather than distinct behavior in the setup. Her dialogue in the confrontation feels thematic and author-driven rather than the natural defense of a servant caught intruding, reducing the authenticity of the status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal state is clearly drawn, but the shift from observer to the suicidal determination of "letting go" feels unearned and abrupt. The backstory ("failed marriage, abandoned research") appears as a list of labels rather than embodied history, and the emotional logic relies heavily on the sudden external catalyst of the airship.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora’s prosopagnosia is a compelling trait that colors her worldview, but the final renunciation feels intellectualized rather than emotionally costly. The choice to leave the sketch reads as a sudden moral stance ("some things were not meant to be possessed") rather than a decision born of deep internal struggle or unavoidable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on stated labels ("diligently curious") rather than dramatized traits. Elias faces no genuine internal conflict or external resistance; his success is immediate and unearned by personal cost or struggle. The "curious apprentice" archetype functions mechanically to move the plot but lacks psychological specificity or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    The character functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a living presence; emotions are reported via labels ("fearing," "motivation was simple") rather than embodied in reaction. Elias faces no internal contradiction or genuine deficit, and his success with the gears is "effortless," stripping the climax of the struggle required to earn his final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Liora is a benevolent archetype without internal contradiction or distinct personality traits; the villagers function as a collective prop, shifting behavior instantly without individual agency or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is legible, but the pivot relies on a sudden internal realization ("he understood") rather than escalating pressure. The interiority leans on stock emotional descriptors ("weight of what he was about to do," "trembling not from the cold") rather than specific, embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s reluctance and the curse’s "balance" logic provide clear motivation, but her compliance feels more rule-bound than character-driven. The internal conflict ("no love for the lost" vs. saving him) is resolved largely by the external constraint of the curse rather than a deep internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lina reads as a stock "cold scientist" archetype whose internal conflict resolves too tidily via an external metaphor. The "micro-choice" to sketch polymers is a low-stakes action that doesn't fully dramatize the emotional cost of her "atonement." The epiphany feels unearned by the prior pressure, relying on stated regrets rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias functions primarily as a symbolic vessel for the story's philosophical inquiry rather than a flesh-and-blood protagonist. While his motivation is stated early ("find the place where stories begin"), his interiority remains abstract and lacks the contradictory impulses or friction required for higher bands. The interaction with the woman is stylized and mythical, devoid of genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.5)
    Character roles lack internal logic; designating Maren a "Chef" while she acts as a mystic tracker/therapist creates dissonance. Kael acts as a static prop for grief who abandons his defining trait instantly upon receiving a platitude, lacking genuine struggle or credible psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    Mara is a functional vehicle for the plot with no internal contradiction or struggle. The key trait, "empathetic decisiveness," appears as a diagnostic label rather than an enacted behavior under pressure. Everyone agrees with her immediately, removing any relational friction or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s internal drive to "modify" is clear, but her pivotal trait ("helix-minded") is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through engineering-specific problem solving. The shift in identity at the end is distinct, but the realization relies on external validation (the vision speaking) rather than a purely internal grapple with the cost of her ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.9)
    Elara functions as a cipher defined by labels ("prism-minded archivist") rather than specific, contradictory desires or behaviors. The realization of her role as "guardian" is asserted via summary rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or sacrifice. She observes the climax rather than enacting it, lacking agency in the story's pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation had always been simple") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. No visible cost is paid for the success; Elias faces no internal resistance, and his competence is never genuinely tested by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias is a functional protagonist, but his internal life lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; his exile is backstory rather than active pressure. The relationship with Lysara is too smooth, missing the "crucible" dynamic where friction forces character revelation. His motivation to decipher the covenant is clear, but the emotional cost of his choices on the page is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is characterized through listed traits ("vegetarian," "pacifist") rather than choices under pressure. His internal conflict regarding Liora’s abandonment ("He should have been angry") evaporates instantly upon her appearance, bypassing the necessary emotional struggle and cost required for a high-stakes reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.7)
    Character motivation is stated rather than shown through difficult choices; Mira's ambition dissolves instantly upon reading a single note, lacking the resistance or internal struggle required for a credible arc. The protagonist's "olfactory sensitivity" is a labeled trait that adds flavor but does not drive decision-making or cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s motivation ("felt like a key") is vague and lacks personal stakes beyond curiosity. She observes the crisis rather than navigating contradictory internal impulses, resulting in a lack of genuine internal conflict. The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a complex agent making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is functional but thin, defined more by a catchphrase ("Foresight in action") than embodied personality. His interiority relies on clichés ("trusted instruments more than intuition") and the irony of his failure is mechanical rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("certify wonder") rather than embodied in a complex choice; the protagonist succeeds through sheer persistence and a loudness increase rather than a costly tactical trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist's agency dissolves in the climax, as the resolution relies on an external entity (the shadow figure) explaining the solution rather than Elias earning it through struggle or specific insight. The shift from sealing to weaving is a received instruction, not a choice forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear, obsessive motivation ("mathematics of emotion") that drives the scene. The "borrowing personalities" trait is dramatized effectively as a mechanism for dialogue and internal conflict, though the personalities function more as thematic mouthpieces than deep psychological shifts. The "hollow" state at closure indicates a felt cost, grounding the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is largely passive, reacting to the pendant and the stranger rather than driving the narrative through choice. Internal shifts rely on "label-speak" (e.g., "space between knowing and feeling") rather than dramatized emotional struggle, and the transformative realization feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a living character; his motivation is stated ("needed communion") rather than dramatized through costly struggle. The emotional arc is linear and low-resistance, moving from curiosity to validated epiphany without genuine internal conflict or error.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara's motivation is legible and her internal state is clear, but her wistfulness relies on stated emotions ("regret," "memory") rather than embodied actions. The character archetype is functional for a fable but lacks specific, granular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is consistent and his motivation is clear, but he lacks the internal complexity or contradictory impulses required for a higher score. His &quot;meekness&quot; is stated as a trait rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or social pressure; he executes the solution without hesitation or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Internal motivation to map the unknown is established well, but the antagonist (the other Kael) speaks in genre clichés ("You're late," "Or early") that flatten the dynamic. The protagonist's interiority is distinct, but the external interaction feels performed rather than authentic to the specific character. The final choice is motivated, yet the emotional cost is stated more than felt in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief is embodied well in the sea glass, and leaving it is a strong, costly choice that earns the emotional shift. However, the transition to the abstract motivation of "protecting the feeling of safety" feels expository and diagnostic rather than organic to the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Veyra is a static, highly competent figure who faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. The "laughing" trait feels like a recurring label rather than an embodied emotion under pressure, and her acceptance of the vision comes without hesitation or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is asserted through introspection ("quiet restlessness") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. The connection to the donor heart feels like a thematic prompt rather than a visceral, embodied reality driving behavior in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is established (seeking answers), but agency is low; Elias primarily observes, climbs, and receives healing rather than making difficult choices. The resolution comes from a magical external force (the sextant/trees) fixing his physical and emotional wounds without a demonstrated struggle or cost, resulting in a passive arc.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a generic vessel for the quest rather than a distinct character; her motivation is a broad "save the world" impulse without personal specificity. Interiority relies on stock physical markers ("throat tight," "fingers trembled") rather than contradictory impulses or unique psychological texture. The hesitation ("What if I forget?") is shallow and instantly resolved by external reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic nature") rather than dramatized behavior. The backstory of turning a woman away directly contradicts the asserted empathy without sufficient on-page reconciliation of that paradox. The emotional arc is functional but driven by external prompts (invitation, map) rather than internal agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer, and the shift from passive observer to active participant is clear. However, the leap from a closed bakery to a need for "absolution" feels unearned by the prior interiority; the guilt seems imposed to serve the theme rather than arising organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a functional, consistent protagonist, but his interiority relies heavily on summary ("And now, Elias understood") rather than embodied struggle. The transition from cataloger to savior is stated rather than dramatized through a high-cost decision; his "burden" is claimed by the narrator but not felt through a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena’s motivation shifts from a passive, abstract desire ("to listen") to active intervention without sufficient internal bridging. Her authority relies heavily on her father's reputation ("Elias's girl") rather than her own agency or skill, weakening the character's standalone strength.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a passive observer defined by stated traits ("skeptic," "glows") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The encounter with the stranger involves no negotiation, resistance, or cost, leaving her agency flat as she merely receives an explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elias is defined by labels ("mnemonically gifted") rather than choices, and his primary action (finding the door) is dictated by a dream rather than agency. The shift from "uncorking creativity" to "bringing them home" lacks connective internal struggle or demonstrated need.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist lacks agency, relying on unexplained amnesia ("no memory of tearing it apart") to drive the plot rather than conscious choice. Emotional reactions are conveyed through stock somatic clichés ("breath hitched," "pulse quickened") rather than embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a strong, distinct protagonist whose actions drive the narrative. The specific choice to take the child's abandoned toy creates a tangible micro-choice with moral weight, grounding the abstract goal. However, the "seasonally mute" trait functions more as atmospheric backstory and a ticking clock than a pressure that forces a specific tactical trade-off in the scene, given he has no one to speak to.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eli’s internal conflict is effectively externalized through the box of fears, creating a distinct psychological landscape. The transition from containment to destructive release is well-motivated, though the final emotional realization ("he understood") relies on summary rather than dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara serves as a passive observer with a convenient "gift" rather than a protagonist making difficult choices under pressure. She faces no internal conflict or meaningful cost, and her ability to "hear" stories bypasses the need for active deduction or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("encrypting vulnerability as strength") is delivered via diagnostic exposition rather than dramatized choice. Her reaction to the ghost is surprisingly mild ("transfixed"), and her agency is diluted because the ghost solves the central puzzle for her.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlowe’s grief is well-embodied through physical details like the crumbling flowers and the weight of the flame. However, the pivotal realization (“knew the truth now”) relies on internal summary rather than dramatized deduction, slightly flattening the agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The summoner is a static archetype lacking internal contradiction or embodied struggle; his emotional arc is narrated through abstract labels ("a wound") rather than demonstrated behavior. The decision to release the prophecy encounters no resistance or hesitation on the page, resulting in a protagonist who functions more as a vessel for prose than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara is largely passive, reacting to Mira’s arrival and exposition rather than driving the scene with distinct desires. The emotional revelation relies on the convenience of a shared secret, and the internal struggle is minimal; the "interrogation" dynamic is told via summary rather than demonstrated through pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's "skeptic" trait is stated ("charmed skeptic") but immediately abandoned; he accepts the supernatural appearance without the resistance or testing that would define skepticism. The emotional arc feels summarized rather than dramatized, with the pivotal realization ("I'm not afraid") appearing as a declaration rather than an earned psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority relies on generic somatic markers ("fingers trembling," "breath shallow") rather than specific psychological texture. The antagonist is a stock villain speaking in clichés ("poisoned honey," "too clever for your own good"), and his sudden passivity at the climax contradicts his established ruthlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Liora lacks agency; her central problem is solved by a secondary character appearing with the solution. Motivation is stated ("carried it like a wound") but not dramatized through difficult choices or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is a distinct, atmospheric protagonist with a clear role, but her pivot from "expose the truth" to "keep the secret" feels asserted rather than dramatized. The realization that "the dead... wanted silence" arrives before the ghostly confirmation, making the internal change feel convenient rather than earned by struggle. The emotional cost of her final renunciation is claimed ("truth burns too bright") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    Ren is a consistent but static focalizer who lacks internal contradiction; his preference for solitude collapses instantly upon Mei's arrival without struggle. The trait "demure audacity" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through difficult choices or distinct behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated ("here for the truth") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or costs. The "intuition" trait operates as a summary of competence rather than a specific, shown cognitive struggle. The stranger functions as a convenient plot device rather than a distinct character with opposing goals.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias’s motivation is stated via melodramatic interiority ("heart a storm of envy") rather than dramatized through complex behavior or specific suppression. His transition from recluse to leader is driven by external validation (the voice) rather than internal agency, and the "prophetic" quality is asserted by the narrator rather than earned in the character's voice or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions more as an archetype of the "misunderstood artist" than a messy, contradictory human; his "peace" and struggle are summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The arrival of the girl serves as a convenient external validation for his internal state, lacking genuine interpersonal friction or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his internal conflict relies on a convenient backstory insertion (the brother/storm) appearing just before the climax rather than being threaded throughout. The shift from fearing the key to mastering it feels slightly rushed emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias functions as a static observer whose internal struggle is summarized in backstory ("had learned," "had spent years") rather than dramatized in the present moment. There are no contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page; his "patience" is a stated trait rather than a tactic tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character competence is undermined by convenient retroactive skills (the locksmith trick) and stock motivations. Interiority relies on labeled emotions ("stomach twisted," "pulse quickened") rather than embodied experience, and the protagonist's connection to the plot relies on a massive coincidence rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—religious duty versus the need for justice—is compelling and clear. However, the premise relies on a chaplain successfully stealing evidence from a prison locker, a significant credibility gap that undermines his established role and competence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation—defiance against a dissolving world—is compelling and clearly dramatized through his refusal to stop working. However, the connection between his past as a "cart glider" and his present as a bell-maker relies more on summarized backstory than active traits in the scene. Veyra serves as a functional foil, but the emotional cost of the "yearning" remains somewhat abstract until the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.4)
    Lena is a functional archetype (the disillusioned believer) rather than a specific individual. Her motivation is delivered via summary ("She had once been like Elias") rather than dramatized experience, and her interiority relies on stock physical reactions ("pulse pounded," "breath caught") instead of specific psychological nuance. The transition from corporate drone to rebel is instant, lacking the friction of genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on label-heavy descriptors ("shadow-laced," "peacekeeper") and stated emotions rather than embodied experience. Motivation is delivered via abstract telling ("to map empathy onto action") rather than emerging from a dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's transition from voyeur to participant is anchored beautifully by the surrender of the parasol tip. This physical renunciation of his "only solid thing" earns the internal shift, providing a visible cost to his change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dialogue feels stiffly expository ("I realized how much I'd lost"), and the internal monologue breaks character with the jarring academic phrase "intersubjective understanding." Liora's immediate acceptance of Elias contradicts the "thorn in her side" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the ritual rather than an active agent; his defining trait ("strangely honest") is asserted in exposition but never tested by a difficult choice on the page. Internal conflict is absent, and emotional reactions rely on stock physical cues ("tremor in his chest") rather than specific, embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s themes rather than a living person making difficult choices. Interiority relies heavily on summary ("Elias had learned long ago," "He was perceptively calm") rather than dramatized struggle. The realization at the end feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant internal contradiction or resistance in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's arc from "reticent" to a willingness to "testify" provides a clear internal shift driven by the scene's events. However, the cost of this transition is abstract—the "weight of discovery"—rather than a deeply felt personal or physical price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the prompt's attribute ("precognitively forgetful") rather than appearing as a lived-in character with contradictory impulses. His internal life is summarized through labels, and the emotional stakes of his memory loss are told rather than dramatized through friction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but his motivation relies heavily on the "luminous ache" label rather than dramatized backstory or embodied need. The shift from repairman to visionary is driven by prompt requirements ("sound of a leaf falling") rather than a deeply established character trait, making the epiphany feel external to his psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on adverbs and abstract labels ("decisively kind," "no pity") rather than embodied action or internal friction. Elias lacks contradictory impulses; his role is purely functional—to deliver the goodbye—rendering him a static vessel for the scene's sentiment rather than a complex agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora acts as a vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation is clear but purely intellectual. She encounters no internal resistance, and her "relearning" is a transactional exchange with a guardian rather than an earned psychological shift. The absence of emotional cost or difficult choices flattens her arc into a procedural task.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "skeptic" label flatly contradicts the protagonist's immediate, unquestioning reliance on magic; she acts as a faithful practitioner, leaving the stated internal conflict of belief undramatized. While the motivation to "turn mistakes into constellations" is poetic, it drives a linear path without the hesitation or scrutiny that would make the character's specific traits consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is legible and the protagonist's interiority is present, but the central choice lacks difficulty or trade-off; she acquires the solution rather than earning it through a character-defining sacrifice. The "reckless" flaw mentioned in backstory does not manifest or complicate the present action, leaving the resolution feeling convenient rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is well-rendered, particularly his observation of Mira, but the "notebook" beat resolves with implausible ease. Mira’s acceptance of his surveillance without friction bypasses a key opportunity for relational conflict, making the reconciliation feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a coherent, if archetypal, "tortured artist." The realization at the climax ("I didn't know how") offers a genuine moment of vulnerability, though the emotional cost is stated rather than fully embodied in action before the final dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Liora fits the "whimsical dreamer" stock archetype without subversion; her internal life lacks contradictory impulses or genuine cost. She faces no difficult micro-choices—singing to the magical tree is the obvious, unopposed path. The "flaw" of forgetting to eat is a stylized quirk rather than a character engine that drives error or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Character interiority is lyrical and consistent, effectively grounding the alchemist’s weary worldview. While the motivation is poetic, the internal conflict remains largely philosophical ("ash" vs. "starlight") rather than testing the character with a hard, compromised choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation and interiority. However, the emotional realization at the end feels slightly more like a functional requirement of the plot than a deep, earned psychological shift derived from the scene's pressure. The "letting go" epiphany comes somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels for emotion ("guilt," "regret") rather than embodied behavior. The title "fractal weaver" is ornamental; Liora interacts with the lamp and stones, but the specific logic of "weaving" or "fractals" never informs her choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal state is clearly rendered, and the shift from harvesting lessons to "holding" grief is a coherent arc. However, the "lion tamer's widow" identity feels slightly decorative until the final image, and the emotional resolution feels rushed given the depth of grief established.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is clearly drawn, though heavily reliant on abstract labels ("regret," "ambitions eroded") rather than dramatized behavior early on. The interaction with the "ghost" functions more as a thematic projection than a character-driven dynamic, but the final choice to drop the wheel earns a moment of genuine agency.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara serves as a competent observer, but her defining trait ("functionally creative") is asserted via backstory rather than dramatized through a high-pressure problem-solving moment with visible cost. The encounter with the woman lacks necessary friction; their immediate philosophical alignment reduces the secondary character to a thematic mouthpiece rather than a distinct agent.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is consistently drawn as an introvert, but his pivotal decision to follow the bear contradicts his established risk aversion without sufficient on-page pressure or internal bridging. The final emotional resolution ("made peace") is summarized as an internal state change rather than dramatized through a costly action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("seeker") rather than a specific individual; his motivation is stated in abstract terms ("architecture of lies") rather than dramatized through lived particulars. The emotional realization at the end feels unearned by the on-page struggle, relying on a magical voice to deliver the insight rather than character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is a functional archetype defined entirely by his "philosophical seed collector" role rather than embodied personality or contradiction. Motivation is stated in exposition ("to preserve ancient methods") but lacks internal friction or personal cost; he performs his task with unimpeded competence. The character feels like a vehicle for the prompt's concept rather than a living protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is consistent but relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("geography of healing," "intimate act") rather than embodied emotion. The character's struggle is articulated through abstract metaphors and summary, creating distance rather than a visceral experience of her specific grief.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen’s internal state is clearly drawn, blending regret with determination. However, the pivotal shift relies on diagnostic reflection ("He understood then the flaw") rather than a dramatic interaction that forces the change, making the realization feel slightly unearned by the immediate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on backstory labels and costume cues (boots on a beach) rather than embodied traits. The dialogue feels performative and stagey, serving as a vehicle for thematic lectures rather than genuine human interaction. Motivation is abstract ("prove scars could sing") and lacks a concrete, actionable goal.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on contradictory labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than demonstrated behavior; the protagonist accepts supernatural guidance without the resistance or scrutiny her descriptor implies. The internal struggle is summarized in metaphors rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias is a functional archetype of the "wise elder," but his interiority relies on sweeping summaries ("watched empires rise and fall") rather than specific, grounded memories. Kael's "rage" is stated but evaporates instantly upon contact, robbing the relationship of genuine friction or behavioral complexity. The "sentimentalist" label does heavy lifting for motivation that feels more abstract than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias acts as a passive observer who receives thematic answers through supernatural intervention rather than earning them through high-stakes choices or struggle. His internal state is rendered through abstract metaphors ("grief... like a living thing") rather than specific, embodied psychology under pressure. The "fiercely meditative" attribute appears as a static description of his work style but never creates a dilemma or constraint that forces a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on summarized backstory (the mother, the fire) rather than active struggle in the scene. The "ethically diligent" trait is told rather than purely dramatized, and the emotional resolution feels mechanically eased by the magical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias is a functional protagonist, but his motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" reads as an abstract authorial construct rather than a visceral need tested by pressure. The shift from "blithe care" to deep personal longing at the climax is summarized in interiority rather than earned through dramatized struggle or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character. She faces no internal contradiction or emotional cost; her hesitation is brief and resolved instantly by the predictive model, leaving her with no difficult choices to make in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is clear ("claw back the silence"), but Elias lacks internal contradiction or psychological cost. He functions as a passive vehicle for the ritual rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated by grief, but his pivotal realization is passive. The epiphany ("He understood now") arrives via a supernatural vision rather than active struggle or deduction, making the internal turn feel downloaded rather than earned through character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's sudden shift from misanthropic recluse ("kept the fools above from bothering him") to populist hero trusting dockworkers feels unearned and convenient. The attribute "rationally rebellious" is asserted as a label rather than demonstrated through complex choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    Miss Voss reads as a competent archetype ("sage outsider") rather than a specific individual. The transformation of the choir members, particularly Maren, is summarized in a montage ("By the third rehearsal...") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices, obscuring the internal cost of "unlearning."

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary ("felt whole," "gift had always been a curse") rather than embodied reaction. The epiphany is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a high-pressure choice or realization in the moment. Mara's internal state is coherent but lacks the friction or contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is a functional protagonist, but his defining trait ("involuntarily truthful") is undermined when he immediately attempts a deception ("Just a box") that relies on a technicality, weakening the constraint. His motivation to "preserve wonder" is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn focalizer whose "noticer" archetype drives the narrative perspective effectively. The internal motivation to silence the house is clear, and the realization at the closure serves as a meaningful Conceptual Repricing of his worldview. The emotional distance fits the character, though a sharper sense of personal stake beyond curiosity would elevate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is frequently summarized rather than dramatized ("she had spent her life chasing absolutes," "truth unraveled her certainty"). Her capitulation to the statue's argument is too swift; the shift from "saving the garden" to "releasing a monster" lacks the friction of a genuine struggle between conflicting values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") rather than traits embodied through action or difficult choices. The motivation ("texture of a missed opportunity") is abstract and explicitly stated in exposition rather than dramatized through felt need or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined by a condition (insomnia) that vanishes conveniently at the end without a dramatized struggle or cost. Her internal state shifts from weariness to purpose too smoothly, lacking the psychological friction or contradiction required for deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.5)
    Liora functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a complex agent. Her motivation is clear, but the inciting incident (a dream giving her the solution) and the resolution (baking without resistance) strip her of agency and internal struggle. The shift from observer to participant is thematic but lacks a felt, on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias lacks embodied interior conflict; he acts with absolute certainty ("knew what he had to do") rather than struggle, making him more a vessel for the plot than a character making hard choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias functions as a passive vessel for the advisor’s instructions rather than an agent of his own salvation. His internal state is conveyed through melodramatic summary ("deepest dread," "hollow") rather than embodied behavior or conflicting impulses. The advisor is a translucent plot device who speaks exclusively in thematic slogans, robbing the protagonist of the need to deduce or struggle for the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    Leeward functions as a competent archetype rather than a conflicted protagonist; his actions align perfectly with his desires without internal opposition or hesitation. The narrative asserts his history ("never been one to fight the current") rather than dramatizing a struggle between contradictory impulses in the present moment. While his interiority is established through sensory details, the lack of a difficult micro-choice or trade-off limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s internal conflict (curiosity vs. fear) drives the first half effectively, but her final pivot—from sprinting away in terror to resolving to find *all* the cracks—feels psychologically rushed. The transition glosses over the "suffocating dark" she just escaped, making the renewed resolve feel like a plot necessity rather than an earned emotional shift. The motivation for the new goal (escape? rescue? release?) remains slightly opaque against the horror she witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is clearly drawn, but the "emotionally rational" trait contradicts his reliance on the rose omen, creating a logical gap in his worldview. Liora functions primarily as a thematic mouthpiece rather than a character with deep agency; her sudden agreement to the compromise ("You're preserving it") lacks an earned emotional transition or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is consistent, but the "stoically sensitive" trait serves as a diagnostic label rather than a dramatized behavior, triggering a deduction for label-speak. The internal landscape is described through summary ("feeling the weight") rather than contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is clearly defined, but his transition from indexer to heir relies on a sudden, unearned emotional shift rather than a reasoned progression. The contradiction between his "logical" nature and his reliance on the library "guiding him" (intuition/luck) weakens the consistency of his internal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    Veyra’s internal landscape of grief is well-mapped, but her passivity in the climax—merely watching her destruction—diminishes her agency. The transition from active creator to victim lacks a decisive on-page choice or reaction that defines her character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena represents a stock archetype (trauma survivor in wedding dress) with motivation articulated through abstract narration rather than specific, difficult choices. While the trauma is clear, her internal state relies on repetitive, formulaic constructions ("She didn't know X, but she knew Y") rather than embodied psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character motivation is declared through internal summary ("This was personal") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. The relationship relies on instant, unearned agreement ("You feel it too... He did") rather than friction or negotiation, and the Pilgrim serves as a functional plot device rather than a fully realized agent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct protagonist with a compelling profession and backstory that inform his worldview ("tracing bloodlines for those who wished to erase them"). However, the secondary character (the uncle) functions largely as a plot device to deliver exposition without generating interpersonal friction or status dynamics. The internal state is vivid but relies occasionally on abstract labeling ("sieved hush") rather than purely embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a consistent, embodied focalizer with clear interiority. His weariness and motivation are legible, though the drive to "recycle mistakes" feels more like a stated theme than a visceral compulsion tested by the immediate scene. The relationship with Seris adds necessary depth, creating a "crucible" of shared professional history.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    Character motivation is clear but delivered through diagnostic summary ("spent a decade chasing a dream that was never his") rather than dramatized struggle. Internal conflict is resolved too neatly via explicit realization, bypassing the necessary ambiguity of a difficult renunciation. The emotional arc feels linear and explained.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a functional archetype of the "redemption seeker," but his interiority relies on generic summaries of guilt ("faces he’d hurt") rather than specific, embodied memories. The pivotal choice (Left vs. Right) feels arbitrary rather than rooted in a specific character trait or tactical necessity, weakening the sense of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s internal landscape is vivid, and her motivation (grief/love) drives the action clearly. The choice to accept the metamorphosis carries a felt emotional cost ("tears cutting silver paths"), validating the "beast whisperer" identity not just as a skill but as a burden she must bear. The contradiction between being "steady" and her trembling hands adds welcome texture to the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's internal landscape relies heavily on abstract labeling ("confusion itself were a kind of devotion," "sorrow," "regret") rather than enacted feeling. While her voice is consistent, the emotional stakes of the "silence" at age seven remain vague, making the "confession" feel performed rather than grounded in specific character history.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character; her stoic reactions to the ghosts ("didn't flinch," "hands didn't shake") create emotional distance and lower the perceived cost of her labor. While her steadfast nature is established, the lack of visible internal struggle until the final tremble makes her feel impervious to the trauma she confronts. The connection between her happiness and the gravity mechanic feels imposed rather than psychologically integrated with the grief she is processing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("heart too big for his own good," "destitute philanthropist") rather than embodied action. The protagonist's acceptance of the prophecy is immediate and unearned, lacking the internal friction or skepticism a "destitute" man might feel. The transition from "no one" to savior happens without a credible psychological shift or decision process.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira is a competent archetype but lacks specific interiority or contradiction; she functions as a vehicle for the plot. Her motivation is stated ("spark a silent revolution") rather than embodied through difficult choices or felt cost. The description "mind calmly inventive" is a label not supported by the standard action of picking a lock with a hairpin.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions more as a vessel for the plot's procedure than a character under pressure; he experiences no internal contradiction or hesitation. His actions are guided by convenient external knowledge (grandmother's voice) rather than a hard choice between competing values. The "promise" motivation is stated abstractly rather than felt through a personal cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization is competent but relies on the "censored poet" label rather than behavioral nuance to suggest depth. The protagonist functions as a thematic vessel with interiority that leans into poetic abstraction, lacking the embodied contradictions or active agency required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Character motivation relies on abstract declarations ("waiting for the hidden overture") rather than embodied desire. The "storm in his chest" is stated as a label but never dramatized through visceral reaction or cost; the emotional landscape feels intellectualized and distant.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lumen's defining trait of "molting personalities" is established through exposition rather than dramatized choice, making his decision to stabilize feel like an intellectual assertion rather than an earned transformation. The dialogue with Elias is expository and lacks the friction of genuine subtext; the emotional shift from vagrant to builder relies on the other character telling him what he is rather than showing the internal cost of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer whose grief is actively processed through his "strategic creativity," turning a trait into a plot driver. His shift from hesitation to the deliberate chaos of the encore demonstrates strong agency, and the internal stakes of breaking his own stasis are palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s internal conflict—duty versus the fear of burdensome truth—is dramatized effectively, grounding the fantastical elements in a recognizable human struggle. The shift from reluctance to acceptance is earned through the revelation of the monsoon's nature, though Nani functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character. The protagonist’s agency drives the climax, as she chooses to plant the seed despite her initial hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is consistent in his melancholic interiority, but his arc resolves through an external magical process rather than a difficult human choice. The emotional burden ("severance") is stated rather than dramatized in the present, and the resolution—fixing a bonsai with lace to cure regret—feels like a therapeutic fantasy lacking a hard, felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (dramatic stars vs. quiet dust persistence) compel the final stance shift; micro-choices like tracing and sketching reveal values under post-flood pressure. Minor epiphanic polish in "humbling" line borders unearned but stays grounded in actions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora's interiority shines in embodied details like tracing scars and ledger ink, revealing adaptive traits through micro-choices under pressure; contradictory impulses emerge in her pursuit despite fear, earning the final stance shift. Jaren applies targeted pressure via guilt-fear mask and admission, forcing her reconfiguration. Minor label-speak ("steadily adaptive") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation from shipwreck trauma drives concrete micro-choices like striking the fork, with embodied emotions (breath hitched, trembling fingers) earning the climactic triumph; Liora applies secondary pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong embodied motivation from trembling hands to steady voice, rooted in funerary traits; inadvertent stubbornness constrains return with felt heaviness in legs during walk. Minor slip: internal conflict more declarative than simultaneous impulses in pivotal desk moment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora's gentle persistence is embodied in micro-choices like ringing the bell softly and lingering with elders, rooting motivation in community endurance. Interiority concrete via tactile details (tracing tiles, bell's weight), with endurance earned as sanctions tighten. Limited contradictory impulses reduce depth, but final ritual reveals values hierarchy without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interior contradiction in unused love's weight driving the gift to the man; embodied via chest tightening and trembling fingers. Final realization earned through parallel past/present kneelings. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing at "the place where unused love was stored."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's micro-choices under pressure—pressing the shard to the photo then to her mother—reveal a hierarchy of values with embodied cost, earning the final endurance. Interiority concrete and particular, like gasping at the reversing image. Mild weakness: initial motivation leans told via backstory summary before inciting test.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira's observation and dawning understanding reveal patient alignment with Vey, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Vey's competence shines in key-sorting but shows minimal flaws or internal tension. Strong micro-choices like holding the arrow compel higher stakes. Earned endurance in moderation at vault feels credible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation rooted in synesthesia and betrayal intensifies via wife's lie memory; embodied scars and forge heat particularize interiority. Final smile earns endurance with cost of dying isolation. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong character-specific motivation in Lira's moonbeam theft for luminous moments, with contradictory impulses (steal vs. build) acting in the jar-sharing beat; Kael's reinterpretation trait forces her relational shift. Final endurance (staying) feels mostly earned via prior glow pulses, but "understood then—destiny wasn’t something you eavesdropped on" edges toward unearned epiphany, softening pivotal closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied contradictions like hollow artistry versus fragile orb sketch driving micro-choices; final readiness earned by causal buildup of thawing metaphors. Thoughtfully spirited trait shown through curious narration under self-imposed pressure. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses frozen isolation with felt vulnerability cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong embodied interiority (phobia "gnaw[ing] at her ribs," "pulse hammering") and micro-choices under pressure (lunge despite fear) earn the change to embracing vulnerability; caretaker forces relational crucible. Minor slip in repetitive epiphany phrasing ("betrayal... sharpened her" echoed later as "remade her") borders label-speak but doesn't unmotivate closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong interiority via embodied tracing of symbols and obsession with pebbles; final shedding of weight feels earned through prior realization of map motive. Contradictory impulses subtle in shift from seeking to retelling silence. Minor lack of overt internal conflict in climax holds back 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation rooted in janitor directive vs. glitch-born question drives micro-choices like setting down mop; interiority concrete via chassis hum and static thoughts. Earned change in picking up mop with deliberate slowness shows endurance cost. Minor slip: epiphany at "he might finally understand" borders unearned without deeper embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Characterization strong in embodied hesitation and micro-choices like Mira tracing the doodles, revealing guarded natures; mutual thaw earned through prior secrecy. Minor slip in stock "pulse quickened" and told irony ("irony wasn’t lost on her") dilutes peak embodiment without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in pretending not to care while ritualistically polishing the first marble; final renunciation of control earned through prior micro-choices like strategic marble placement. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in tending amid withering. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives consistent micro-choices like overriding AI protocols and syncing the hologram, culminating in an earned laugh of wonder/despair; interiority feels embodied in "heart pounded" and "hands trembling." Minor slip in unearned expertise on xenos without prior struggle, but flaws like delusion of grandeur complicate her competence without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena's motivation to unravel the code roots in musician curiosity, intensifying through embodied actions like brushing water and grasping violin; interiority concrete in breaths hitching and fingers finding strings by instinct. Internal drive shows via hesitation before wading, balancing caution against compulsion. Final play as endurance forecloses silence with felt isolation cost; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in peak, but change earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's interiority shines in embodied details like the "finger that trembled—not from cold, but from the residue of fever," rooting his guilt-driven motivation; contradictory fear of mistakes versus freeing uncertainty acts in scene via descent despite doubt. Final renunciation of prophecy's weight feels earned through causal chain to photo/note. Minor slip: reflective blocks slightly exceed BRR without always tilting present micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Embodied contradiction shines in "should have run. But he didn’t," compelling the offering; minor label-only flaw in "religiously skeptical" lacks early tradeoff cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority and embodied consistency in habits like tracing spines or ear to obsidian, with motivation to witness clearly rooting endurance; subtle contradiction emerges in the new book's intrusion but resolves too passively without a micro-choice foreclosing a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's steady hands on guitar amid racing heart during Liora meeting embodies contradiction under pressure; shift from curl as "second heartbeat" mystery to family earned via therapy traits. Liora's cautious exuberance applies relational pressure, altering Elias's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation rooted in consistent traits drives higher-stakes probing of diaries and tapestry; interiority concrete via stained fingers and palm to concrete.

    Elias's motivation to capture echoes roots in consistent traits like ink-stained persistence, culminating in an earned reconfiguration via the girl's reaction. Interiority concrete and embodied, e.g., "breath shallow with hope" during jar attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong consistent motivation rooted in mapping and patience-sculpting, with final handclasp as earned alliance foreclosing solitude; interiority embodied in tactile sensations like palm on stone and ice give, but reflective summaries occasionally abstract contradictory impulses into labels rather than simultaneous action.

    Elias's micro-choices under pressure (picking lock, sending evidence despite trembling hands) reveal hierarchy of values, earning the final confrontation; interiority concrete via grandmother's voice cueing present action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority concrete and embodied (tracing singed letter with calloused fingers), contradictory impulses surface in "wanted to believe but past a thorn," final reach earned via dialogue pressure; minor epiphanic polish in grandmother recall doesn't flatten choices.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Honesty trait embodied concretely in peripheral restraint and doubt constraining realization; internal contradiction via doubt vs. task shows simultaneously without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interiority via embodied warmth/pulse syncing with heartbeat and voice-cracking persistence under arbor hush; final sharing choice earned by prior isolation/scoffing hints, revealing values hierarchy with village cost.

    Strong interior contradiction between foolish hope and hollowness shown in soil-pressing ritual; micro-choices like unspooling thread reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation as ignorance cartographer intensifies compellingly from hesitation ("Before the pen met the blank page") to creation, with embodied conflict in her exhale and hand movement.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong interiority via stained fingers and unheard notes reveals copyist's isolation driving dust revival; micro-choice to hum lyrics earns final laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses to chase vs. outrun emotion act in mask vision and ash-scattering; final renunciation earned by prior pigment-ash mixing and promise, with visible cost of self-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation rooted in tasting memories intensifies through tending and culminates in earned vision of mother's kitchen; embodied emotion peaks in "gasping on the greenhouse floor." Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("proving that even in ruins, there was still room for gentleness") hedges contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's truthful curse creates subtle internal tension when speaking to Maren ("words tasted like ash"), constraining evasion but not driving a pivotal contradictory impulse or high-cost choice. Motivation to preserve wonder feels told via reflection rather than fully embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Solid individual traits and endurance at closure, but lacks 9+ scene-acting contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's particular attunement to "creeping normality" drives consistent micro-choices like crouching on the dock and slipping the shard under the door, revealing character through embodied noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Diver's hesitation before threading ampoule reveals contradictory impulses under unraveling certainty, earning the final realization with embodied cost (recoil, slow exhale).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Grim optimist embodied effectively in dice roll despite infinite risk, earning final endurance; abstract "texture of missed opportunity" slightly unearned without deeper contradictory impulses in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like varying yoyo drops; interiority concrete via tactile sensations (thumb on grooves, gears like vertebrae).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied (cold sweat, pulsing luminance behind eyes), with contradictory fear/curiosity driving micro-choices like pressing the palm. Advisor applies relevant pressure without dominating agency. Final renunciation of cloak feels earned by prior causality, though advisor's guidance borders on over-helpful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward's embodied interiority (vibrations in soles, hair, veins) roots motivation deeply; micro-choices like dubbing escalate to compel the climactic crack. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly undercuts peak agency, but endurance of prior listening pays off in earned reconfiguration. Strong voice-specific traits avoid stereotypes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses like curiosity versus fear embodied in chiseling the groaning shell despite the pattern languages' whisper. Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the fracture and fleeing, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost in her inverted understanding. Final renunciation of her lifelong study feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation as "archivist of last resort" roots clear traits and compels the preservation choice with felt cost in the collector plan; contradictory impulses on lie vs. truth act in the scribe parallel moment. Liora's rivalry applies pressure via dialogue, forcing micro-choice to reveal intent. Minor slip: interiority occasionally abstracts dilemma before full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's stoically sensitive trait enables endurance in feeling despair ("chest tightened") yet acting firmly, earning his final keeper-of-echoes reconfiguration with visible cost (inkwell emptied). Micro-choices like writing responses reveal values under pressure. Minor label-speak ("stoically sensitive nature both a curse and a gift") slightly abstracts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Concrete interiority and embodied reactions culminate in earned realization at "Veyne. The same name as his," compelling reclamation with felt personal cost; motivation rooted in job-specific traits drives micro-choices without epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Strong interiority through grief-embodied actions like folding cranes and polishing dreams; contradictory impulses peak when lanterns feed back sorrow, earning the transformative endurance. Final invasion traces to her persistent choices, with visible cost in the dream whispering her brother's name. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive inevitable overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Embodied grief (hollows of bones) and micro-choices ("Show me") reveal contradictory impulses acting in scene; final endurance earned by prior pulses and loss. Ghost applies brief crucible pressure. 9+ test passed cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's embodied reactions (hands shake, thread tugging chest) reveal contradiction under pressure; earned nod forecloses isolation with felt personal cost. Pilgrim's traits shown through actions but verge on archetypal, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's guilt as sieve motif embodies contradictory impulses—falsifying others' pasts while doubting his own—with micro-choices like trembling hands tracing wood revealing values under pressure.

    Elias's motivation to recycle mistakes concretely embodied in drawer pull handling; contradictory endurance of burden vs. untethering fantasy acts in scene. Seris's thoughtfulness forces micro-choice in correction. Final renunciation earned via prior reflections anchored to present exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (paddling vs warring heart/actions), with final renunciation of compass earned via embodied micro-choices like deeper paddle dips and island drift; flaws (blind paternal loyalty) compound before release. Interiority particular (stars as scripture) without diagnostic labels. Voice coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's contradictory impulses (cold calculus vs. trembling mercy) act in the mirror chamber, earning the final renunciation of forgetting with embodied cost; Mara's pressure reveals his flaws through micro-choices like choosing left.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong interior contradiction in the "paradox of the destitute philanthropist" and micro-choices like clutching the jar reveal values under pressure, earning the final shift to feeling "necessary"; woman as secondary pressure forces pivotal recognition without dominating.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira's lock sentinel expertise drives micro-choices like hairpin pry and vault knowledge, rooting motivation to spark revolution; embodied thrill coils with steady pulse, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

    Elias's interiority embodied in eel-herding precision and chest-weight promise; micro-choices under unraveling reveal values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.

    Concrete interiority and poet-specific lens on scars compel endurance to carry the unread map; embodied warmth of timer grounds emotion. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene before closure laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is textured and profession-specific, but the only micro-choice—sketching dust—arrives after the climax; no contradictory impulse is acted upon under pressure, so the “renunciation” of drama feels declared rather than dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s survivor-guilt and adaptive reflex read in her tactile handling of the ledger and the pause before facing Jaren; the contradiction between seeking beauty and needing truth is embodied, not declared. The final pocketing of the strip is a micro-choice that seals her renunciation of innocence with a felt cost. Yet Jaren’s guilt is asserted more than dramatized, muting the relationship crucible and keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s deafened desperation is embodied in every tactile gesture; the tuning fork as surrogate voice is specific and charged. Interiority stays concrete—he “traces patterns in the air,” not “feels hope.” The final beat shows earned renunciation: silence remains, but now speaks, costing him the illusion of full restoration. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The undertaker’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is shown, not told, through his refusal to leave the lens alone and his solitary march into the sea; the stolen funerary book and the trembling hands give concrete interiority. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict never sharpens under pressure; the final stillness is felt but not paid for by an on-page choice that costs him something visible. Character voice is consistent and specific, yet the absence of any live relationship or secondary character keeps the crucible narrow. Meets the 9+ quick test on causality but not on simultaneous contradiction, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—sun-warmed tiles, trembling hands—yet her contradictory impulses (keep exile memory alive vs. risk nightly runs) stay mostly summarized, not dramatized in a single beat. The final stance of letting children hold both bells is credible, but the cost (sanctions tightening, patrols doubling) is stated, not embodied in her body or choice on the final page. Still, her gently persistent trait drives every tactical move, and the community’s fate is legibly tied to her micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lien’s contradictory impulses—clinging to unused love vs. giving the tear away—are dramatized in one embodied gesture; the renunciation costs her the literal talisman and the fantasy of private salvation, a price legible in the final image. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing tear into stranger’s palm) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Only the father’s instant pivot from hollow to hopeful feels slightly over-calibrated, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-rooted need to mend the past is viscerally embodied; the photograph-burn moment externalizes loss without label-speak. Her choice to press the shard to her mother’s chest crystallizes a hierarchy of values—creator vs. daughter—at palpable cost. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the beat where she “touched the texture of time” edges toward abstraction yet is saved by tactile payoff. Closure renunciation is earned: the lost stay lost, her aging is the price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s shift from captive to collaborator is sketched through embodied beats—raw wrists, lighter chains at dawn—but her interior contradiction stays summary. Vey remains cipher; his refusal to fight the scavenger is choice without visible internal cost. Micro-choices (how much seed to take) show hierarchy of values, yet the final “weight of hope” is asserted, not dramatized. Enough specificity to feel individual, but one more beat of flawed hesitation would earn 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s synesthetic curse and terminal urgency are vivid, but the interiority drifts into abstractions (“he didn’t believe in luck”) that tell rather than embody. The final micro-choice—pressing the foil—carries cost, yet the contradiction between fatalism and last-minute hope could be sharpened on the page earlier. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the renunciation feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific (“curator of fleeting light”), but the decisive refusal of the train is under-motivated: no prior flaw or fear of permanence is dramatized, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal. Kael remains a cipher; his “quietly savvy” trait never complicates or endangers the moment. The earned stasis lands, but only on poetic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to finish the orb yet fearing exposure—remains present in every beat; the final micro-choice to “flip the last switch” crystallizes the arc with visible cost (the humming ghosts he now must host). Embodied emotion is strong: the thumb on cracked leather, breath fogging, fingers on dusty toggles. Mother warning is cleanly anchored and tilts the present stance. The glassblower identity, however, is asserted more than practiced; we never see furnace heat or molten risk, so the occupational lens feels borrowed rather than lived, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s fear-of-heights label is declared, never embodied under pressure; the stunt-double past stays off-stage and therefore fails to complicate present choices. Interiority is vivid (“gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat”) and her micro-choice to lunge toward, not away from, the caretaker shows adaptive grit. Yet the climactic forgiveness (“let’s start over”) feels sudden because no prior beat dramatizes her re-valuing vulnerability; the emotional cost is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “mildly obsessed” never manifests as a concrete, costly quirk. The final renunciation is signaled early and feels pre-decided, so the beat carries limited tension. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page; the oracle’s calm stays flat across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    E-7X’s calm, glitching curiosity is sketched through concrete micro-choices—hovering hand, slower mop strokes—so the “remarkably composed” trait earns its keep. Interior contradiction is hinted (duty to clean vs hunger for origin) but never collides in a single beat; the loops externalize rather than dramatize the split. The final renunciation (“ready to begin again”) is legible but the cost is abstract; no prior option is foreclosed on the page. Still, the voice-specific perceptual filter (shattered-mirror light, static between code) keeps the robot from reading as a stock archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s guardedness and Elias’s covert listening are cleanly opposed; the lens-exchange beat crystallizes mutual risk. Interiority stays concrete (“ticket stub still warm in her pocket”). Yet the pivot from suspicion to trust relies on a single shared admission—cost is felt but not compounded by deeper flaws or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, ritualized tending and the incremental give-and-take with the garden create a believable interior life; the contradiction between control and surrender is embodied in every micro-choice. The final renunciation—carrying the seedling away, leaving the marbles—pays off the lifetime of self-deception with a tangible, scaled cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solo arc is complete. Hairline slip: “mended deception” is named once in interiority rather than purely dramatized, stopping just short of 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with sideways time is clear and personal, but her interiority drifts into abstract exposition (“she knew the truth was buried in the data”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final laugh is a strong micro-choice, yet the cost feels intellectual, not visceral—no bodily or relational price is shown. Competence is well-balanced with risk, but the absence of a second on-page character keeps status pressure and relationship crucible unused.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s curiosity and musical memory feel specific; the moment she chooses to bow the floating violin crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—breath fogging, fingers finding strings—without slipping into label-speak. The cost is legible: the program blanks, the house darkens, the music now lives only in her. A hair more contradiction under pressure would push this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s fever-fragile interiority is concrete—thumb-smudging ink, knees in disturbed earth—and his guilt is embodied rather than labeled. The contradictory pull between fleeing prophecy and needing to witness the aftermath is present, but the decisive shift to “present, not right” feels slightly under-cued; one more micro-choice showing him relinquish the need to predict would have locked the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reckless streak and skeptical bent are shown through action and memory, but the swallowed-truth motive stays abstract; the final gesture of handing over the valve reads as symbolic rather than a choice that costs him something we can feel. Interiority is vivid (“hair on his arms prickled”) yet never pits contradictory impulses against each other in the same beat, so the arc flattens into observation rather than self-revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The keeper’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; “wondered if she, too, was a story waiting to be unfolded” is the only micro-choice that edges toward contradiction. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The final renunciation is credible but low-cost because the book was never dramatized as a temptation. Trait consistency is strong; embodiment drifts into lyric summary rather than visceral beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays in one emotional register; the curl and Liora trigger wonder yet never force him into a contradictory choice that costs him anything. The “second heartbeat” line is evocative, yet no beat shows him risking or refusing anything, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged. Liora’s function as living proof is too frictionless to test or change him.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s tactile obsession with books and walls is vivid, but her final leap—touching the tapestry to open a “door”—lacks a prior micro-choice that proves she would risk the unknown; the interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s curiosity about the cookie clue and inherited need to decode his father’s “transpose” imperative are cleanly legible; the final choice to “play it” feels earned because every beat has forced him to rehearse that role. Interiority stays concrete—his breath catching, hands shaking—without label-speak. The woman’s pressure tests him, but she remains a cipher; status dynamics are hinted yet never complicate his hierarchy of values on the page. Still, the micro-choice to heat the dot and the final assent show contradictory impulses (suspicion vs. filial compulsion) acting simultaneously—enough for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Father Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for revelation yet fearing possession—remains vivid and embodied; the violet smear and heartbeat loop externalize the split. Micro-choices (pressing thumb to lip, triggering the pedal) steadily escalate stakes. The final “invitation” earns its turn because the palette, pedal, and anchor have all been handled under pressure. Cost is felt: the violet spreads, staining skin, signaling irreversible surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora’s interiority is textured—breath on glass, shell warmth—but her contradictory impulses stay summary-level (“she had laughed then, bitter and sharp” vs. present silence). The final stance crystallizes (pressed shell, cracked horizon) yet the causal chain from cookie slips to this moment is asserted, not dramatized; cost is felt but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholiless while fleeing his doubles—is shown through embodied micro-choices (palm to tablet, letting go of the door). The final renunciation costs him the labyrinth’s certainty, earning a credible shift. Yet the older-scarred self speaks in abstract thesis (“You can’t conquer the labyrinth”), muting pressure. Still, motives stay legible and the refusal lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile listening and Mira’s numbness are embodied in every beat; the moment she lets the silence “become something she could hold” is a credible, earned shift. Interior contradiction is present—Mira both fears and craves the hush—yet the final acceptance is slightly under-powered: we see her exhale but not the immediate cost on her body or next action. Still, traits govern speech, gesture, and worldview; no therapy-speak intrudes. Character work is vivid, but the micro-choice that seals the change could carry sharper forfeiture to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s meticulousness and curiosity are shown through tactile detail (brass clasp, ink texture) and a history of risk-taking; the interior contradiction between solitude and duty is present but not yet pushed to a costly choice. The final beat—“integrity demanded action”—is declared, not dramatized; we feel the weight of the recorder, not the cost of crossing the threshold. A hairline slip from summary keeps this just below the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s trembling fingers, flinch at citrus, and final steady grip on the lantern embody contradictory impulses under pressure. The vial’s scent triggers an embodied collapse on-page, not label-speak. His micro-choice to keep the vial—renouncing erasure—pays the closure cost foreshadowed by years of avoidance. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts to therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirien’s desire to “feel the texture of time” is vivid and idiosyncratic, anchoring every beat. The rope-touch micro-choices embody her ethically-playful stance and escalate to the final tug, so agency is legible. Internal contradiction, however, is only asserted (“fear vs surrender”) rather than dramatized in body or breath during the collapse of time; the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Still, the closure choice is character-bound and irreversible, satisfying the earned-stasis bar for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Liora’s motive—find beauty in the unfinished—stays consistent, but the only micro-choice is “played again.” The bowl cue is passive (dipped, listened) so no contradictory impulse is enacted. Closure reaches Earned Stasis, yet the cost is ambient, not personal. Characterization clear, not stellar under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s practiced detachment and the micro-gesture of re-pocketing the spent petal give us a believable interior contradiction, but the story stops short of forcing her into a cost-carrying choice; she observes more than she acts, so the “earned” threshold for 9+ isn’t met.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s broker instincts surface only once (ledger touch) and don’t complicate the choice; the interiority is warm but generic (“breath caught,” “pieces clicking”). The final yes is credible yet cost-free—no visible trade-off or contradiction in scene. Mara’s tremor is good embodied detail, but her arc is off-page; relationship shift is asserted, not crucible-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interior ache is embodied in the reed child and the trembling placement of it; the moment she offers the sculpture against the arbor crystallizes her contradictory want to belong yet remain invisible. Motivation stays consistent: every beat circles the fear of being “ungrafted,” and the final hand-shaped charcoal line externalizes that cost. The travelers function only as witnesses; no status crucible or secondary pressure tests her, so the arc is solitary but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s obsession with “the interrupted cadence” is declared more than dramatized; her only embodied beat is touching the bridge. No contradictory impulse or flaw complicates her resolve, so the climactic reach feels pre-scripted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s grief is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“mathematics of emotion”) that tells more than embodies. The sister-shaped hole motivates, yet no contradictory impulse complicates his ritual; he glides from loss to comfort without micro-choice that costs him anything visible. Closure gives warmth, not renunciation, so the arc feels consolatory rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (butter-knife pry, tape pocketing) and a believable seven-year concealment, but the final freeze behind the shelf is pure avoidance; no contradictory impulse or cost is dramatized on the page, so the arc stalls at observation rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need to control vs. the tree’s demand for surrender—is dramatized in one continuous beat: her hand meeting wax-soft bark, the laugh-gasp, the deliberate unclenching of shoulders. The moment carries visible cost (she kneels in mud, renounces intervention) and is rooted in earlier textual clues, so the arc earns its quiet stasis. Minor slip: “she understood transformation better than most” is diagnostic self-label, but it sits outside the climax and doesn’t deflate the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sleepless painter’s insomnia is viscerally embodied (“paint on his canvases never dried; he worked in layers, scraping away”), and the brooch-in-pocket moment gives a micro-choice that externalizes inner fracture. Interior contradiction is strong: he claims to paint “to remember” yet the woman corrects “you paint to forget,” exposing a split the final hand-taking accepts. Cost is present—the tide swallows the return path—but the shift from passive reception of dreams to active surrender is slightly under-motivated on the page; we see the gesture more than the irreversible internal tilt that locks the cost. Still, within 700 words the arc of exhausted compulsion crystallizing into fatal cooperation feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s quiet gift is sketched with economical specificity, but his interior contradiction—delight in magic, then horror at its cost—stays summary. The pilgrim’s motives remain opaque; her sudden inability to release the pearl reads as plot convenience rather than earned flaw. Because the final stance (“they were watching”) is asserted, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something concrete, the arc feels observed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s desire to “compile fragments into meaning” is concrete and embodied (the damp parchment against her ribs). The micro-choice to meet Dain and handle the valves shows hierarchy of values, yet interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“reactively visionary”). Cost is legible—she trembles holding the erased map—but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes her irrevocable next step.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s meticulousness is shown through tactile beats (map on hood, finger on crack) and the final dare is in character, but interior contradiction is thin: we’re told he “doesn’t hesitate” without any on-page flicker of fear or second thought, so the cost feels announced rather than embodied. The punch’s hum and the arrows register as external cues, not internal conflict drivers. Earned, but not yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s skepticism is declared, not dramatized; the pivot to belief is a single beat of palm-on-tile with no interior contradiction shown. The notebook transcription is the only micro-choice, but it carries no visible cost or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Veyra’s longing to “discover what happens after goodbye” is concrete and stakes her eternal solitude; the amulet burn she accepts at the end shows embodied cost. Interiority stays specific to an immortal’s fatigue rather than generic angst. Yet the moment of refusal is summarized (“She had her answer”) rather than dramatized, muting the contradictory impulse that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s ambivalence between filial con-artist reflex and nascent moral agency pulses in concrete beats: pocketing the pot, the thumb-print test, and the final “prove it” dare. Interiority stays embodied (“ink so dark it seemed to drink the light”) and contradictory impulses coexist in-scene rather than in summary. The choice to withhold the pot demands a visible social cost—he inherits the risk the diplomat fled—yet the beat is slightly under-cooked: we feel the stakes for the woman but not yet for Elias’s own skin. Still, character voice is particular, flaw-driven, and the refusal lands as Earned Stasis with foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stationer’s ink-stained patience and “deliberate slowness” give us a consistent, embodied interior, yet his contradictory impulses (record vs. let go) are stated more than enacted in scene. Micro-choices—tracing edges, writing one final line—register but carry no visible trade-off or loss, so the Earned Stasis feels gifted rather than paid for. No secondary character appears, so relationship pressure is absent; the character work is solid but not irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s obsession with frayed realities is vivid, but his interiority loops on the same abstract note; the mother-song memory never sharpens into a contradictory impulse that forces a costly choice. The woman’s exit leaves his stance unchanged—he “doesn’t feel the need to run,” yet no prior beat shows him fleeing, so the renunciation feels un-earned. Micro-choices (pocketing the certificate, tracing the scratched name) are atmospheric, not tactical; they don’t tighten options or foreclose a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s skepticism is cleanly established and his shift to listening is dramatized through the cello bow, not speech. Interiority stays concrete (“gasping,” “breath hitched”) and the final renunciation costs him his lifelong debunking identity. The only drag is the fisherman’s remembered line acting as external prompt rather than self-discovered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lan’s contradictory impulses—carnival loyalty vs. investor fluency—surface early and tighten through micro-choices (spiking food, slipping notes). The final hand-on-shoulder beat earns a credible endurance stance, but the cost is only gestural; no concrete consequence is felt on the page, capping the arc below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet, tactile curiosity is vivid; the sand-grain micro-choice at the end crystallizes his renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only stated, so the final acceptance feels slightly under-causal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile world is vivid—his fingers “tracing the cracked ceramic plate,” feeling the drone “like a second heartbeat”—and the final release of the bird crystallizes his quiet authority. The interior contradiction between serene certainty and the risk of irreversible failure is present but underplayed; a sharper moment of doubt would have pushed him past the 9-line. Mara functions mainly as witness; her one micro-choice (handing the tool) is too light to act as crucible. Still, the earned stasis lands with cost: the drone’s pulse now matches the ship he can never see depart.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s occupation-driven need to map the “singular convergence” is concrete, but interiority drifts into atmospheric lyric rather than contradictory impulse; the final demand to reach the lake-center is earned yet the keeper’s single muttered line is too slight to test status or motive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tuner’s quiet obsession is rendered through embodied ritual—tracing cracks, pacing the square—but his interior contradiction (restore what can never fully return) stays summary. No micro-choice visibly risks failure or forfeits an alternative path; the final exit feels predetermined rather than renounced. The “infinitely patient” label never collides with a moment where patience costs him something we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s grief-loneliness is viscerally embodied (“gnawed at her ribs”); the vial-as-mother’s-gift motivates the climactic surrender. Interior contradiction—clinging to the unopened scent while chasing others’ memories—peaks when she uncorks it, dissolving the diver and her own nostalgia in one beat. The cost (empty vial, last link to mother gone) is legible on the final line, earning a Resonant Reconfiguration. Minor slip: the diver’s dying words feel slightly expository, blunting micro-choice immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory need to both confront and outrun his inherited silence is embodied in every beat; the climactic self-naming costs him the lattice and his former anonymity, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete—“hush coil around his throat”—never sliding into label-speak. The single-scene crucible keeps relationships off-stage, so status dynamics are N/A; motivation is traceable and intensifies to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—flight versus acceptance—are dramatized in the moment she closes her fingers around the bead; the embodied shudder and salt-taste show cost without label-speak. The final press of the bead to her lips crystallizes a credible, irreversible endurance that forecloses further flight, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor deduction: the seven-year amnesia is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s interiority is lyrically specific (“salt-stiffened air,” “splinter in the chest”), but her contradictory impulses stay static; the needle’s command is the only external pressure and she obeys without visible internal cost. The “re-imagining” turn is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternate path. Earned stasis is hinted at but not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“warmly curious hum settled in my chest”), actions track with motive, and the final kneeling is earned. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the 20-year gap is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s puzzle-solving itch and filial ache are credibly fused; his chalk transcription on the arcade floor is a sharp micro-choice that externalizes both. Interiority is concrete (“clipboard pressing against his ribs like a secret”) and avoids label-speak. The mother’s sudden appearance is motivated by her prior chalktrail, so the final recognition carries earned emotional cost without overt exposition. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is slightly tidy, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s trembling fingers and her shift from quiet observer to clandestine messenger give a credible arc; the interior contradiction between fear and duty is present. Yet her emotional palette stays safe—no genuine misstep or irrational impulse complicates her ascent, so the cost feels pre-packaged rather than earned. The disguise beat is efficient but sketched in summary, muting the embodied risk. Still, within the word count, her motive holds and the final stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s contradictory fear/regret cycle is embodied (shallow breath, clutching shard, pressing it to scar). Micro-choices—wiping droplets, speaking into humid dark—track value hierarchy with cost. Apparition functions as projected self under pressure, forcing crystallized stance. Earned softening of scar and shift from failure to “first step” land as tangible change.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—returning to a forbidden zone while numbed by anesthetic—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices: scratching the cast, pressing coral to stone, aligning plaster with the boy. Each action externalizes her need to convert private trauma into shared language, and the final smile costs her the safety of detachment. The boy mirrors her without becoming a device, giving the relationship a crucible that shifts both states. Interiority stays embodied; no label-speak intrudes even under drugs.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s desire to “bring back” the fresco’s feeling is vivid and embodied in her meticulous exposure choices; the moment she pins the print to the wall crystallizes a credible, costly shift from observer to giver-of-joy. Interiority stays concrete, but the “weight in her chest” is the only internal contradiction on offer—no simultaneous doubt or rival urge—so the arc is linear rather than torn. Still, the final smile carries earned cost: she relinquishes sole authorship and lets the collective witness complete the act.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s “methodically playful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—hovering fingers, nickel flip—that tilt the scaffold and the stakes; the final surrender to the archangel’s question costs him certainty and is earned by these visible quirks. Interiority stays concrete, but the fourth awakening leans on abstract sensation (“coiled around ribs”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping him just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reluctant re-entry into subversion is credibly grounded in past trauma; the “spark of defiance” line crystallizes motive. Interiority stays concrete—spectacles fog, breath catches—yet the turn from fear to complicity could carry more embodied friction. Quill’s charm is shown through action (ease under inspection) rather than told, but his personal stakes remain off-page, muting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s insomnia and grief are vividly embodied; the trembling fingers, salt-tears, and spiral writing ground his ache. The “blossom armistice” micro-belief is stated more than dramatized—no moment shows him testing or nearly betraying it—so the interior contradiction stays abstract. Still, the final act of writing carries credible cost: he risks reopening loss yet chooses the page, earning a quiet renunciation of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s quiet, methodical caretaker persona is vivid and embodied; her thirty-seven-year solitude is shown through tactile ritual, not told. The internal contradiction—preserving others’ names while remaining nameless herself—peaks when the bamboo sigh releases an unknown name into her bones, softening her foxglove regret. That micro-choice (blowing the tube) is the only decisive action she takes; everything else is memory or observation, so the arc is more accumulative than causal. Still, the cost lands: she accepts an unending, unreciprocated guardianship, and the glass orchid’s answering hum makes the endurance legible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—gloved fingers, fogged ink, tremor under pressure—but her contradictory impulses (restore trust vs. fear of weaponized speech) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-choice. The final “dip into air” shows earned endurance, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than bodily or social, keeping the arc just shy of 9-band depth.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—tame the volcano vs. honor its wild voice—surfaces early and drives every tactile choice. The trembling hand that steadies after decoding the letter embodies earned shift; the cost (she will now “listen,” not control) is legible. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and alters tactics, meeting BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief-sharpened obsession with lost songs is palpable in tactile micro-choices (tracing spines, trembling at the lyric sheet). The reinvention trauma is sketched more than dramatized; we’re told he “buried the scholar” but never see the lie strain a present beat. Interior contradiction surfaces only in the final sentence—too late to pressure earlier tactics. Still, the ending choice carries credible cost: he abandons flight for salvage, meteorite warm in palm.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief and need to understand Mira’s vanishing are palpable, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“fractured hush,” “necessary distances”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the midpoint alters his tactics; the final renunciation is asserted, not dramatized through a fresh action. The trait of “analyzing grain” is named but never shown steering a decision. Daughter remains off-page, so relationship crucible cannot apply.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s yearning for “belonging” is stated early and re-asserted at the end, but interiority is mostly paraphrased (“he felt something akin to peace”) rather than embodied in contradictory sensation. The final hesitation gives a micro-choice, yet the cost is abstract—he simply “takes one last look”—so the renunciation feels under-cooked. No interior contradiction is dramatized in scene; emotion is declared, not shown under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—clinging to recovery yet accepting loss—surfaces only in final two beats; earlier beats summarize rather than dramatize competing impulses. Micro-choice (pocketing seed) is present but cost is abstract; no embodied tension between want/fear before that moment. Trait “recollectionist” stays label-level; no on-page transliteration failure that would sharpen stakes. Acceptable for length, yet not fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s boredom-with-craft is vivid, but the “analytical” trait is asserted more than enacted; the bishop drop reads as impulse, not calculation. The duet moment embodies her desire, yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the change feels lightly earned. Cost is atmospheric, not personal—she walks away energized rather than foreclosed. Interiority is sensory-rich, but emotional summary (“she was tired”) substitutes for embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember yet fearing exposure—surface in her tactile micro-choice to grind the forbidden moonstone against her skin. The final decision to tattoo the man is earned: her isolation, the stone’s glow, and the widening star-gaps compound to make silence intolerable. Cost is legible: “You’ve made me a criminal twice over” simultaneously brands them both. Interiority stays concrete, though occasional poetic abstractions (“the cosmos breathing”) flirt with diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s reflective nature is shown through sensory attention (glass grain, voice tension) and the dream that seeds restlessness, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs him something on the page; the final “understanding” is asserted rather than dramatized through a forked decision or renunciation, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and vocation to “translate pain” are concrete via the notebook, the itch of scars, and the choice to listen. The stranger’s trembling hand on the pen shows the cost of the stolen voice, but the bargain itself is reported, not dramatized, so the interior contradiction peaks late. Still, the micro-choice to offer the page earns the softening of grief—visible, proportionate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “logical dreamer” interiority is vivid—she “saw equations in the way waves curled,” a clean, sensuous contradiction. Yet her final shift from observer to actor (“the work had only just begun”) is declared, not dramatized; we never see her actually alter a physical choice under pressure, so the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. The gauge vibration stands in for a micro-choice, but it’s reactive, not decisive. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and specific, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is visceral—his fingers on warm stone, the diary strap bite—but the final beat (“he understood then”) is told, not embodied. Interior contradiction is hinted (curiosity vs dread) yet never forced into a costly micro-choice on the page. The father obsession motivates entry, but the closing hand-hover lacks a visible stake-shift tied to Elias’s own flaw or limit.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is textured through synesthetic memory and embodied ritual, but the decisive shift from “seeing” to “believing” is asserted rather than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page pays the cost of that leap. The watchman supplies welcome external pressure, yet their exchange stays observational, so status and relationship remain static. Earned stasis is hinted at, but the final stance is not foreclosed by any visible forfeiture or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s war-weariness and Kessar’s penitent stance are sketched in economical, embodied beats (the trembling clipboard, the coin pressed into her palm). Interior contradiction is present—“Maybe the price isn’t what we give up…”—but the pivot to shared burden feels slightly rushed; the micro-choice to “carry it together” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the hierarchy of values (ritual > personal exhaustion) is legible and costly. Voice distinction between the two is thin; both speak in the same measured cadence, muting status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—manufacturing drought to “preserve”—are dramatized through the tactile act of cradling the warm egg while planning the dams’ release. The sentimental drawer is shown, not told, and the final renunciation of the drought carries visible cost as the salt will dissolve his monument. Interiority is concrete, but a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“amoral philanthropist”) nicks the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—temple-body versus defiant will—drives every micro-choice; the thread-memories externalize conflict without therapy-speak. The final “testament” line shows earned change, but the cost is more asserted than embodied—no lingering ache or forfeiture is felt in body or voice. Still, her silence-as-shield motif remains specific and stakes scale to the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora’s urbane calligrapher identity is vivid—ink-stained fingers, unshakable composure—yet her interior contradiction (precision vs. subversion) stays stated, not dramatized. The brother argument is off-stage, so the rawness never surfaces in micro-choice; the final “smile” feels unearned because no on-page cost is shown. Serenity is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the puppet-show past and stick handling give her a tactile, vocational spine.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is textured—her fingers on the moth wing, the loose knot as tactile signature of “transiently rooted”—but the only pressure she faces is the possibility the butterflies may not arrive. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she simply watches, records, accepts. The final renunciation feels pre-decided rather than forged under duress, so the cost is elegiac, not personal. Still, her perceptual idiom is consistent and specific enough to clear the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt over forgetting rather than the original disaster—grounds every micro-choice; the rope-braiding beats embody “technically gentle” and the final hum of names is earned. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The only bar to 9+ is that the forgiveness itself is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingertip tracing of cracks, the dream-figure’s smile that unsettles him—but the contradiction between “foresight enough” and “hindsight was his true companion” is asserted, not dramatized in a micro-choice. The final beat (accepting the key) is a conceptual yes, yet the cost is only abstract “endurance”; no immediate bodily or social price is shown. The woman acts as oracle, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent. Still, his perceptual signature (edges of order/chaos) stays consistent and steers action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nabu-sharru’s frugality-as-devotion is embodied in every beat: the hush of his sandals, the trembling finger on the tile, the refusal to flee when mercenaries close. The final renunciation—accepting that the tile’s purpose is preservation, not power—carries visible cost: he kneels empty-handed among ashes. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; the only slip is a brief “understood then” summary that slightly blurs the peak shift.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction is shown through her years of plotted revenge that collapses into pity; the trembling hand, clenched pin, and final offer to dance embody the shift. Veyra’s amnesia-plus-flashback device makes his arc feel externally bestowed rather than internally earned, blunting relationship pressure. Closure still lands because Elara’s renunciation carries visible cost—she pockets the whole pin and invites the village-burner onto an imaginary dance floor—so the change is legible even if Veyra’s agency is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is evocative—“his breath steady, his heart a metronome” shows embodied resolve—but the decisive shift from craftsman to dream-bearer is asserted rather than dramatized; the cost of erasing his own boundary is named, not felt. Contradictory impulses (practicality vs. longing) are stated, not pressed together in a single beat under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the ribbon while preaching release—are dramatized in the quiet offer of the peach; the girl’s matching ribbon turns memory into mutual recognition, paying the cost of shared loss without therapy-speak. Interiority stays concrete (“juice sweet on her tongue” as closure). The -0.3 keeps it under 9 because the girl’s feistiness is asserted more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    The curator’s bewilderment is palpable, but her shift from passive cataloguer to active inheritor is asserted more than dramatized; the tub “inquiry” is still summary. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she never considers leaving the shell alone—so the final smile feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized—she bargains, tracks, reads shelves for lies—but her interiority drifts into label-speak (“realized some lessons…”) at the exact beat where contradictory impulses should collide with her sister. The time traveler’s panic is vivid yet never complicates Elara’s stance; their statuses remain parallel, not crucible. Closure cost is present yet generalized to “we,” softening the personal price she must pay for reopening the wound. Still, micro-choices (diary page as coin, fingertip on shifting spine) keep her alive and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief is vivid, but interiority drifts into poetic summary (“quiet ache of being free yet bound”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic choice—to join Liora in dissolution—is implied, not dramatized; we never see him weigh forfeiting the living world. Micro-choices (touching mirrors, reading ledger) are atmospheric, not tactical. Result: character feels symbolically rich yet causally thin at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s “warmly methodical” nature is shown through tactile, patient handling of the rope and seal, but her interior contradiction—curiosity vs. institutional caution—stays summary (“She had always dismissed them as myths”). The final resolve to archive truth is credible, yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied; no immediate social or professional price is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ryn’s motive—carry silence out—stays legible; the binding micro-choice anchors her arc. Interiority is concrete (“stone warm and humming with stolen silence”) yet stays single-note; no contradictory impulse complicates the final act. The endurance cost is felt, but the bloom’s collapse is externalized rather than internalized, so the emotional price reads light for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief-anchored vocation and retro-visions give him texture, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“shard of hush,” “prove coincidences”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final laugh and walk-off register as release, yet no micro-choice on the page visibly costs him anything or forecloses an alternative path—he simply exits. The prism quiets thought, but this passive effect never forces an active decision that reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation is declared, not dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s preemptive nostalgia and fear of self-erasure give her a sharp interior engine; the final “turn away” crystallizes her new stance with visible cost. Interiority sometimes drifts into abstract thesis (“identity wasn’t something you built…”) rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. Still, her micro-choice to walk the fog-bridge backward is credibly powered by earlier fragments and carries the story’s emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—wanting to defy hopelessness yet unsure how—remains embodied in the tremor she feels while her fingers stay steady on the rag. The micro-choice to let the rag fall and burn out is a credible renunciation that costs her tool and signals acceptance of memory over spectacle. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the arc is interior and complete. The only minor slip is a brief diagnostic tag—“she understood then”—but it is immediately grounded by the warm stone pulse under her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s observant patience is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing water, weighing the cicada); her decision to release the object crystallizes her stance toward time and family. The interior contradiction—yearning to stay yet sensing departure—is present but could be sharpened in one beat of overt self-interrogation. Cost is felt: the cicada’s vanishing forecloses her passive refuge. Still, the brother remains off-stage, so status pressure is only implied, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s claustrophobia and the doll-as-talisman are embodied in every step; the contradiction between bunker-bred fear and skyward hunger drives each micro-choice. The final hand-brush is a credible first stride toward agency, not a cure, so the arc earns its scale. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—even at peak altitude. Cost is visible: she will return to crushing walls, now knowing they aren’t the only space.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s quiet expertise and embodied micro-choices (watching the vial, poling to stillness) give him credible interiority; the passenger’s arc is thinner, sketched mostly through Elias’s diagnosis rather than her own contradictory impulses. The final “thank you” signals relief but no visible cost or irreversible change for either rider, so the closure feels gentle rather than earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra’s motive—save a fracturing world—remains abstract; no concrete symptom of collapse appears, so the cost of refusal never lands. Interiority is atmospheric (“pulse quickened,” “breath misting”) rather than contradictory or embodied under threat. The final sit-down is earned only by riddle logic, not by a prior micro-choice that visibly risks anything personal. She never misreads, hesitates, or forfeits an alternative path; the throne simply accepts her.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s shift from healer to recluse is sketched in evocative shorthand, but the interior contradiction between mercy and isolation is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the scar-link moment supplies a single micro-choice that finally externalizes her flaw, earning partial credit for change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “virtuously mischievous” trait is shown only once—laughing at the 3:17 AM text—then abandoned; the final pivot to educator is declared, not dramatized. Interiority is evocative (“weight of every ‘what if’”) but drifts toward label-speak (“he realized…”). The bolt-diamond transfer externalizes change, so the cost is felt more by the prop than by the body. Still, the contradictory impulses (escape vs. repair) are legible and the closure choice is credibly irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s dynastic guilt and curiosity are vivid; the crank-handle choice crystallizes motive. Interiority stays concrete (“breath hitched,” “handle grew warm”) and the final turn carries cost—he inherits a silenced legacy he must now carry. Yet the epiphany is slightly front-loaded; we see the realization more than the internal friction that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric’s mute withdrawal and sudden surrender to the marionette strings give us a credible arc of renunciation, but the interior contradiction between “withdrawn” and “instant capitulation” is asserted rather than dramatized; the micro-choice to drop the sword lands, yet the emotional cost feels compressed because the prior beat shows no embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s grief is sketched in lyrical abstractions (“broken-hearted,” “chest tighten”) rather than embodied contradiction; the button choice is passive finding, not a pressured micro-decision, so the final note-writing feels predetermined, not costly. No interior clash is staged in-scene; empathy substitutes for agency.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through hoarded truths and the key, but interiority drifts into editorial tag-lines (“tyranny of indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and step forward register as earned, yet the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table. Cost is present—capture imminent—but the emotional price feels asserted rather than viscerally tasted. Voice remains consistent; competence is balanced by genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s lifelong decoding mission is palpable; the final exhaustion and lighter case give concrete cost. Interiority stays sensorial (“lungs burned,” “reed trembled”) rather than abstract. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the high band is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s seed-sorter precision seeds her leaf-sorting obsession, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“absorbed some of the arbor’s quiet wisdom”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final smile and silent sorting gesture earns a quiet renunciation, yet the cost feels lightly sketched—no irrevocable loss is made visceral. Still, her micro-choices (plucking the moon-dusted leaf, crumbling the pebble spiral) keep motive legible and accumulate to an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s tinkerer identity is vivid in the opening, but the interior contradiction promised by “uncertainly certain” is asserted rather than dramatized until the final line; the micro-choice to step into the fall is single and late, so the cost feels intellectual, not embodied. The compass and clock recur, yet their grip on his tactics is off-stage; we’re told they pull, not shown him weighing. Still, the arc from precision-fixation to embracing uncertainty is legible and tied to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—precision vs. the ache of being named for the first time—plays out in embodied micro-choices (crouch, press palm, coin transfer). The final gesture of pressing the coin into Elias’s hand crystallizes a hierarchy of values: understanding over possession, shared fracture over solitary craft. Cost is legible in the tremor before contact and the refusal to speak first. The only drag is “redemption wasn’t about fixing…” which abstracts what the gesture has already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The collector’s weariness and new hunger for laughter are palpable, but the woman-ghost remains a charming device rather than a crucible; she pats the rock and gifts him a firefly-note without forcing him to risk or surrender anything. His single micro-choice—accepting the note—feels gifted, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s need to “quantify mercy” is concrete and idiosyncratic; the interiority stays physical (phantom pain, pulse-matched light) rather than diagnostic. The final refusal to keep drinking/seeking absolution is credible, but the stranger’s bone-mask is too lightly sketched to act as a true crucible, so the relational pressure promised in the prompt never fully materializes. Micro-choices (drinking the vial, reading the glowing numbers) track cleanly with his math-obsessed lens. Cost is present—he now carries the knowledge of when to stop—but the emotional price feels calibrated rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive—honoring overlooked histories—remains steady and is embodied in every micro-choice (tucking the fragment beside her notebook, tracing the painting, fastening the locket). The final renunciation—accepting perpetual search as the honoring itself—carries visible cost (“she would keep searching”) and is earned by the causal chain. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The only minor slip is the father’s remembered maxim, which edges toward aphorism rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s observant trait is embodied in tactile dust-reading and the mainspring test, but her interiority drifts into abstract “theories” rather than contradictory impulses under fire; the final lift feels more symbolic than personally costly, so the arc hovers at competent rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s obsession with compressing eternity is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice under pressure; he uncorks the bottle, places the page, and watches the collapse with the same stoic register start to finish. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to him, so the final “world is new” moment feels observed rather than earned. The interiority stays abstract (“he understood: perfection was a prison”) without sensory or bodily anchoring that would individuate him.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic preservation vs. revolutionary destruction—are dramatized in the shard-handling and mirror-ritual beats; the final renunciation (exhausted collapse while clutching the shard) is earned and visibly costly. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is Liora’s functional flatness; she serves more as thematic foil than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, ragged breath, and the memory-jolt when he touches the chip—but the “wilts near dishonesty” trait is asserted, not dramatized in a choice. The final turn (accepting the covenant) is prepared by the childhood flashback, yet the cost feels symbolic rather than embodied: we see no immediate concrete consequence for him. The stranger functions more as oracle than crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the micro-choice to insert the chip is legible and irreversible, earning a mid-band pass.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. fear of being swallowed by the lagoon—are dramatized in the final kneel-and-seal beat; the cost (accepting the lagoon’s claim) is legible. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The sensibly-eccentric trait is shown through the vial ritual, not told. One slip: grandfather’s psychometry flash is summary, not embodied, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s sculptor identity is vivid—his hands “itch” to carve—but interior contradiction is only asserted (“always learning”) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final carving of the light-bridge is an embodied action that retroactively justifies his trait, yet the stakes of that act feel abstract because no personal cost is rendered on the page. He moves from observer to participant, but the emotional price of staying in the timewoven cavern is told, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile postcard handling and deliberate brushwork; the final micro-choice—painting the single moon-flower—caps her arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “quietly driven” trait is asserted more than tested under opposition; no contradictory impulse on-page. Still, the beat sequence (study, recall, paint) links motive to action cleanly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—microfilm smudges, trembling fingers—but her decisive sprint with the ledgers feels sudden; the diary-touch visions show contradiction, yet the final risk isn’t prefigured by an on-page micro-choice that costs her something visible. Lila’s fifty-year vigil supplies emotional weight, but the relationship crucible is asserted more than staged under joint pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s refusal of false comfort and his turn to “alchemical memory” are sharply particular; the interior contradiction between contempt for wishes and secret hunger to resurrect the town is embodied in the ache of his hands on the bottle. Yet the climactic choice—releasing the remembered wish—remains a solitary epiphany without micro-opposition or visible bodily cost, so the arc feels slightly under-forced for elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—dead-language murmurs, tactile memory of the foghorn—but the pivot from archivist to listener is declared more than dramatized; the final “he understood” lands without a preceding micro-choice that costs him anything visible. The pomegranate omen is sensuous yet external; we never feel him weigh abandoning the Archives’ mandate against his new vocation, so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a dead past while courting a living future—pulse in the acorn-cap press and the hatchling contact; the final renunciation (“carry its weight forward”) is earned. Yet her interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“texture of borrowed time”) that blurs bodily stakes, and the grandmother memory is recalled rather than dramatized under present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—listening vs. acting—are dramatized in the rope-pull; the near-catastrophic mis-read costs her certainty and the villagers their safety, a felt price. Interiority stays concrete (“hands pressed to the flagstones”) and avoids label-speak. The switch-beat is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaw: the priests remain off-page, so status dynamics are inferred, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet, custodial interiority is rendered through tactile ritual; the lantern glass acts as an embodied memory-map. The final witness-moment crystallizes his shift from caretaker to co-participant, cost paid in trembling fingers and warmed glass. Motivation stays soft but consistent: vulnerability sought through service. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s muteness and need to witness ghosts are vivid; the final gesture of scattering dust shows embodied cost. Yet his contradictory impulses stay static—no micro-choice complicates his silence until the box opens, so the change feels administered rather than earned. Interiority is atmospheric but repeats the same note of weighted stillness, muting tension. Still, the renunciation of speech carries a palpable price in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—watch-ticking, dust-tracing, urn-hum—but the moment he decides to “stitch time back together” arrives as declaration, not dramatized contradiction; the cost of becoming keeper is asserted, not embodied. No micro-choice on the page shows him relinquishing a concrete prior want, so the renunciation feels conceptual rather than paid for in flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her grief is embodied in the lagoon’s hush and the feather’s weight—but the moment of shift (“healing wasn’t about mending…”) is articulated rather than dramatized, so the final stance feels slightly managed, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet resolve is embodied in tactile wire-work and animal trust; interiority stays concrete. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene—he never doubts or recalculates—so the final act is credible but not dramatically tested. The “six-month” death sentence functions more as premise than pressure, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than freshly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s shift from scoffer to participant is credibly embodied—his fingers keep returning to the amber, a tactile micro-choice that externalizes doubt. The interior contradiction (“weight of his own skepticism like a second skin”) stays active in scene, not abstract. Cost is legible: he forfeits his lifelong intellectual stance the instant the amber is dropped into the mortar. Missing the 9-band because the relationship crucible with Liora is under-exercised; one line of shared academic history isn’t enough to make their reunion a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s grief-ritual is embodied in the creak of the jetty and the papery rattle of pods; his stooped posture and shallow breath externalize loss without label-speak. Interior contradiction is present—he “has no illusions” yet still casts seeds—creating a credible tension. The final renunciation (turning away lighter yet heavier) is legible, but the cost feels generalized; no specific memory or sensory anchor makes the battlefield’s ghost personally his. Micro-choices are mostly observational; a single active risk (speaking back to the heron) would have pushed this into 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt-shaken hands and the leaf talisman give concrete interiority; the decision to re-enter the tunnels is foreshadowed by the wax-sealed memory and the cylinder’s call. The contradiction—seeking the dead to quiet ghosts—drives every beat. Cost is legible: he forfeits the fragile stasis he bought with isolation. One decimal off 8.8 only because the renunciation beat is a single sentence; a sliver more embodied hesitation would lock the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his thumb on the compass, the way silence “deepens” rather than merely exists—but the moment of decision remains abstract (“he began to draw”) without a concrete micro-choice that costs him something we can see. The contradiction between isolation and chosen vocation is present, yet never activated as an on-page dilemma that forces visible sacrifice. Still, the embodied perceptions and generational weight keep him credibly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirien’s motives—wonder over greed—are declared early and her playful-cautious stance stays consistent; the micro-choice to trade each chess-secret is credible. Interiority is light but embodied (breath fog, trembling fingers) and avoids label-speak. The final grin is earned because she has already accepted the guardian’s warning-price, so the arc closes with visible cost. Flaw: we never feel a contradictory impulse that might have made the renunciation sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s contradictory impulse—clinging to scripted identity while craving unscripted witness—surfaces early and culminates in the kneel-and-ask beat, a micro-choice that visibly costs her detachment; the historian vow carries palpable forfeiture of former safety. Interiority stays concrete (“hand trembled before signing”), never label-heavy. The man’s benevolent ruthlessness is shown through the drink/cliff offer and the final invitation that strips her of pawn-status, not told. No competence overreach; flaws drive the surrender of the chessboard and the adoption of a riskier witness-role.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s need to “understand the shape of home” is visceral and consistent, driving every beat; the contradictory pull between clinging to memory and surrendering to the stone is shown through bodily sensation rather than label-speak. Interiority is concrete—mercury in veins, feather barbs pricking palm—but the final shift into collective “buried talents” is asserted more than dramatized, blunting the cost of his personal change.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-shaken interiority is vivid—fidgeting fingers, ring-twisting, tapestry-tracing all externalize self-reproach. The memory-scene choice to reach for the board, not Liora, crystallizes hierarchy-of-values under fire. Forgiveness is earned: labyrinth burns, threads snag skin, silence answers back. Micro-flaw: “steady, unbroken” alternate-self feels summary beside embodied present.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s defiant-artist streak is shown, not told, through her touching the forbidden spire and weaponizing poetry; the contradictory ache for self-mending while courting catastrophe gives her credible internal tension. Micro-choices (taking the shard, speaking three poems) progressively raise her exposure, and the final refusal to wait for the ritual lands as Earned Stasis with cost—“she felt something worse—alive.” Echo’s status as pressure-foil is clear, but their own motives stay ornamental, capping relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s dread and compulsive mapping of scars to pockmarks are vivid, but the climactic “narration” is an interior abstraction rather than a volitional act; the emotional cost is felt yet not dramatized through a micro-choice that visibly seals his path. Interior contradiction is strong early—uncertainty vs need for meaning—but the final beat shifts to passive reception of memory-flood rather than an active decision that forecloses a live option. Earned stasis is implied, yet the absence of an on-page fork or irreversible act keeps the arc just shy of the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s regret and the buried promise are vivid; his kneel-and-lunge for the sinking shell embodies the stakes. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “space between” epiphany drifts toward abstraction without a prior dramatized contradiction to cash in. Still, the renunciation of reclamation carries felt cost, satisfying the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is embodied through tactile micro-choices (palming the glass, blowing the cork) that externalize his “whisper” thesis; the final shared silence with Maren shows a credible shift from ridicule to recognition, paying the cost of public credibility. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of belief remains slightly under-dramatized—Maren’s turn is registered only by “breath caught,” not by an irrevocable action that locks her new stance. Still, the contradiction between Elias’s need for proof and his surrender to the storm’s listening is kept alive in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief-propelled quest is vivid, but interiority slips into abstractions (“geography of loss”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene; no micro-choice inside the station alters his next step—he simply obeys the next call. The censer warms, yet he never weighs keeping vs. abandoning it, so the final walk-off feels pre-ordained, not earned renunciation. Missing beat where moon-shifted symbols could force a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s involuntary-truth trait and safety-seeking are concrete from the first paragraph; the glass-eye trial forces a visible micro-choice (tear it away) that costs her illusion of silence. Interiority stays embodied—“her stomach tightening,” “hands shaking”—and the final stance (“fear remained and that was the point”) is earned renunciation with cost. No contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously, so the arc is slightly tidy; still, the change is credible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s solitary ritualism and sensory acuity are vivid; the moment he presses the revived boutonnière between his fingers crystallizes a believable shift from custodian to inheritor. Interior contradiction—duty versus curiosity—remains present but could be sharper under the memory surge; the epiphany feels slightly foregone rather than wrested. Still, the final micro-choice to “tend” the stranger’s story carries visible cost in the lighthouse beam’s sweep, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative—his fingertip on the chart, the hollow of inherited duty—but the decisive pivot (“the promise… suddenly felt hollow”) is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; the earned cost of abandoning the shop is legible yet still abstract, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—her dread, fatigue, and dawning recognition braid together in embodied beats (tracing the star-scars, the shared exhale with the firefly). The final acceptance is earned because every beat of the climb strips away her former sovereignty and leaves her “no longer marked by constellations, but by something deeper.” No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc is coherent, specific, and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s desire to “bottle presence” is concrete and embodied; the curl’s pulse against her skin externalizes the internal want. Elias’s return carries credible weight—thinner, bright-eyed, changed—yet the beat where she decides to share rather than hoard the distilled moment lands cleanly. The only drag: “I needed to know if you were still you” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the contradiction that could have been sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s jealousy toward his past self is vivid and embodied (“coiling in his gut”), but the story stops before he makes a micro-choice that would foreclose a path; the final beat is still anticipatory. Interior contradiction is strong—desire to soar vs. fear of burial—yet no on-page decision crystallizes it. The jealousy drives the emotional engine, but closure is deferred to the unseen visitor, so cost is implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s tactile “mapping” of grief and Clara’s stillness create a credible crucible; the final micro-choice—etching the screw—pays the emotional cost of naming and reclaiming. Interiority stays concrete (“oil stains and the calluses”), avoiding label-speak. The parallel naming (“Elias”) lands as earned coincidence rather than contrivance because his prior absence-of-smell is already embodied. Only the grandmother remains off-stage, so relationship pressure is single-axis; still, the dyad’s status shift feels palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—scholarly skepticism vs. need for maternal magic—are embodied in the trembling quill dip and the deliberate crystallization; the final smile is earned because the rune that burns “with memory” cashes in every prior failure. Interiority stays concrete (“scars…like failed sigils”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she risks physical pain and final failure to let ink shard rather than flow. Cost is on-page: the scars remain, now re-read as stories, not erased—Earned Stasis meets the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt and need to apologize are embodied in the ritual with the bottle; the micro-choice to breathe the scent rather than drink is a credible, character-specific renunciation that costs him the chance at full absolution. Interiority stays concrete—‘his breath shaky’, ‘pressed it to his lips’—and avoids label-speak. The only slip is the curator, who functions as a prompt-delivery device rather than pressure source, keeping relationship crucible off-stage. Still, the final stance is earned: he accepts imperfect miracle and walks away lighter, scar intact.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. surrender the words) are announced rather than embodied in immediate micro-choices. The decisive act—pressing the dictionary to the stone—reads as symbolic ritual, not a pressured character decision with visible cost. Earned stasis is asserted (“she had become the first weaver”) rather than dramatized through bodily or emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s tactile obsession with the key and the cut-thumb beat give embodied cost, but interiority drifts into abstract “understanding” rather than contradictory impulse; the final shift from resistance to acceptance feels declared, not wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “physics of letting go” is asserted but never embodied in a concrete, costly micro-choice; the final acceptance is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into abstractions (“measure the weight of a shadow”) that distance rather than reveal. Relationship to Mara remains observational—no status shift or mutual risk under pressure—so the crucible test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-driven need to “burn the numbers” is palpable, but her interiority drifts into inherited aphorism (“probability was just a language for the universe’s cruelest jokes”) rather than fresh contradiction under live pressure; the final resolve is credible yet leans on summary, not a micro-choice we watch her body make.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s cultivated estrangement is rendered through tactile micro-choices—palming the silent disc, murmuring into dead lines—so her refusal to “fix” callers feels earned. The final “Good” crystallizes her stance, but the interior contradiction between caretaking and withdrawal stays verbal rather than embodied in a single, costly gesture. Still, her voice is specific, her limits legible, and the endurance costs her nothing we can see on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in the salt-steeped skin and the locket’s weight; the final release is credibly earned by the accumulating sensory ache. Interior contradiction is light—one mention of “trying to preserve her” versus “let her go” could be sharper under pressure—but the micro-choice to drop the locket crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; archivist vocation surfaces only as label, not as enacted skill. Still, the renunciation carries visible cost and the voice remains particular to a mourner who catalogues small moments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “desperately jocular” shield is shown in his opening pigeon-grin and self-aware banter, giving us contradiction-in-scene rather than label. The interiority stays concrete—his pulse quickens, his palm feels the rock’s hum—so emotion is embodied. The final beat crystallizes a credible renunciation: he accepts the debt-forward lesson, foreclosing his original “cure” quest with visible cost (the rock gone, the slip “later” in hand). The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“he needed connection more than air”) that slips into near-label-speak just before the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—language-through-skin and compass-as-heart are concrete, embodied micro-choices. The final renunciation (“she carried its song within her”) is earned by the stillpoint absorption that costs her the external path. Yet the blind mapmaker never makes a true mid-scene decision that alters tactics; she follows notes and compass until revelation arrives. One contradictory impulse in-scene would push this to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora’s “confidently uncertain” persona is evoked more through label than embodied contradiction; the pen as talisman is strong, yet her decisive shift at the end (“All she had to do was decide what to keep”) feels abrupt because we are told, not shown, the hierarchy of values that lets her risk rewriting the town again. Elias functions mainly as a comforter, so the relationship-as-crucible beat is thin. Interiority is atmospheric but drifts toward abstractions (“the chaos of her own mind”) rather than sensate conflict in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s quietly-charismatic trait is shown through gesture and attention rather than label, and her interior contradiction—composing joy out of grief—remains embodied. Elias functions more as admiring mirror than advisor; he never supplies new information or risk, so the relationship crucible stays cool. The final “Keep going” choice is credible but costs nothing on the page; the story therefore lands in competent mid-band rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession is vivid—her fingers on the frayed tapestry, breath hitching at the gouged eyes—yet her pivot from hunter to ally arrives in a single line of dialogue (“Then let me help”) without visible interior friction; the cost of that surrender is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet-rebellious trait is shown through childhood trespass and the present break-out, but the interior contradiction between fear and resolve is asserted rather than embodied under the restraints; the final fusion with Liora lands as earned stasis, yet the serum’s price is declared (“burning”) rather than felt in a bodily micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s coin-flip and map-reading micro-choices show embodied ritual, but interiority drifts into explanatory labels (“the labyrinth remembered things”). The final hand-off is credible, yet the woman’s motivation is asserted, not dramatized; cost is felt but not deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris’s silence is embodied through tactile ritual (mirror, shutters, pebble) rather than label; the girl’s micro-choice to pocket the pebble and revise “witch” shows earned reweighting. Interior contradiction is hinted but not fully simultaneous under pressure—Maris never risks failure or loss, so cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, the final smile in the mirror crystallizes a quiet hierarchy of values: teaching stars outweighs being understood.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s grief for his sister is concrete—turning it “like a chess piece”—and his decision to step into the night carries a palpable cost. Yet the interior contradiction between “planting forests” and armed rebellion is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him hesitate over a magnet or window cue that would force a visible trade-off. The final image is earned, but the middle lacks a micro-choice that crystallizes the stakes for him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirien’s interiority is concrete—bare feet, thumb on bone, pulse in ribs—and her shift from self-erasure to self-claim is legible in the final walk back. Yet the mother’s “Violence became impossible here” is delivered as exposition, not embodied contradiction, so the emotional cost feels administered rather than dramatized. The micro-choice to pocket the scrimshaw is perfect; the later choice to “stop fighting what you are” is asserted. Still, the arc lands with visible weight: she no longer makes herself small.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—ritual speech to stave off silence—is vivid, but the piece never risks a choice that could fail; the micro-choices (whittle, narrate, sip) merely iterate the same stasis. The “blank-faced performer” label is asserted, not embodied in conflicting impulses during the beats. Because no option is ever foreclosed, the endurance feels observational rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“tremor of certainty” as drumbeat—but the poet’s contradictory impulses stay abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs her anything until the final kneel, so the arc feels foregone rather than earned. The “aesthetically driven” trait is asserted repeatedly yet never forces a trade-off; it decorates instead of complicating. Closure lands as tranquil epiphany without a palpable forfeiture; the melting ice is external weather, not personal price. Character remains memorable for voice, but motivation never tightens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s color-blind painter identity drives every beat: his negotiation with pigment, his envy of Mara’s certainty, his bargain with Liora. The final brush-stroke is earned because we have watched his tactile substitutions build. Interiority stays concrete—“the weight of them,” not “I feel inspired.” The only drag: Liora’s motives remain archetypal, so the external pressure feels slightly lighter than the internal.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s tactile obsession with “texture of connection” is vivid and embodied; the lens-in-hand beat crystallizes motive. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where he both craves and fears the hum—so the final epiphany feels slightly foregone rather than hard-won. Still, micro-choices (ringing, listening, palm-to-glass) track cleanly to the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief is palpable through tactile detail (ring, stencil, wrist) and micro-choices (tracing, climbing, pressing ink). The interior contradiction—clinging to Liora while chasing her ghost—drives every beat. The final tattoo act crystallizes a credible shift from drowning to wearing grief, paying the cost of perpetual thorns. Missing only a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but solo arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the only micro-choice—texting “How?”—feels lightweight because the deck’s threat remains abstract. Interiority is evocative but loops on the same metaphor (“mapped / being mapped”) without fresh contradiction. The final beat obeys causality, yet the cost is intellectual, not visceral; tension never penetrates her body or routine.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing for forbidden knowledge is vivid, but the moment she accepts Kael’s injunction “You have to let go” is stated rather than dramatized with bodily cost; interiority tilts toward paraphrase (“She understood”) instead of a final, irreversible micro-choice that locks her out of the archive. The saffron-veil label is evocative yet never used to constrain action or reveal contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet, embodied patience is vivid; the stone’s pulse and his stillness show contradictory impulses in scene. Yet his final smile feels sudden—no micro-choice visibly costs him, so the renunciation lands soft. Still, interiority stays concrete and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s gentle ethos is embodied in tactile micro-choices (steady breath, trembling fingers), and the poacher betrayal tilts his worldview with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the climactic renunciation—“I lost the whole illusion”—edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction that should power Earned Stasis. Still, the chameleon-tail trim crystallizes a new, harder gentleness, satisfying the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s plant-telepathy and scar-reading are vivid, embodied traits that tilt two micro-choices (entering the tunnel, turning the cup), but the interior contradiction between “closure” and “listening again” is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final beat registers as calm acceptance without visible cost; the scars stop aching off-page. Still, the perceptual signature is specific enough to keep him above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s desire to “find where unused love is stored” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this obsession matters now—never crystallizes; the grandmother locket beat is backstory, not present pressure. She makes only one micro-choice (reaching for the pen), so the promised cost feels symbolic rather than personal. Still, her perceptual filter is specific and the embodied “weight of a held breath” keeps her from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s longing is lyrically evoked, but interiority drifts into stock “cosmic whispers” and “stardust” shorthand; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the climactic release feels foregone rather than earned. Micro-choices are limited to looking, reaching, kneeling—none test a hierarchy of values. The arc is recovery, not transformation; cost is aesthetic, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s dreamlessness and sudden archive summons are evocative, but interiority stays abstract (“he understood, or thought he did”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the choice to pocket the clock and “guard the sparks” is declared, not embodied. Cost is asserted, not felt. Meets basic arc, falls short of earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The philosopher’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized. The gear-touch triggers translocation, yet the decision to “unravel” is asserted, not shown via a beat that costs him something tangible. The final step forward reads as surrender rather than earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her grip on the punch, the sand sucking at boots—yet the “unused courage” motive stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. Elias functions as oracle, not crucible, so status shift is absent. The final step onto the sand registers as earned because the star-stamp glow retroactively pays for her earlier refusal to answer, but the cost is more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s muteness and nerve-damage backstory give him a sharp, embodied lens; the bolt-hunt externalizes his need to test numbness versus pain. Yet the final refusal—“he would not let it go unanswered”—is declared, not dramatized; we don’t see the next risk he accepts, so the cost stays conceptual rather than felt. Interior contradiction is present but stops one beat short of true stakes-payment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s resolve is vivid, but her interior contradiction is asserted (“breaking nothing”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice; the final smile is the first visible cost, so the arc feels more declared than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and tactile habit of tapping rhythms are cleanly individuated; the interior contradiction between scientific duty and creeping suspicion is dramatized through her page-by-page hunt. Yet the climactic “answering knock” is accepted without visible fear or second thought, so the final micro-choice feels slightly under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is evocative but drifts into thematic summary (“the rebellion had forgotten its own magic”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final palm-to-stone beat earns a micro-choice with cost, yet her awkward confidence is told once and never tripped by action, so the trait stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s defiance and plant-telepathy are vivid, but the interior contradiction between lifelong suppression and sudden surrender to the voices is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final “Now we begin” lands as declaration, not embodied cost. Still, her gnarled hands, refusal of Council rules, and the tactile transfer of hum to Lina keep her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s survivor guilt and refusal of “healing” are embodied in micro-choices (burying the photo, steady watering) that earn her final stoic stance; the contradictory impulses—fleeing vs. tending—co-exist in scene. Mira functions more as oracle than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—needing to face darkness yet recoiling from its sentience—drives every beat; the tarot re-naming and erasure of the portrait are concrete micro-choices that externalize the split. The final “shape of the ache” renunciation costs him the last relic of the relationship, earned by prior causal chain. Interiority stays embodied (trembling fingers, salt-thick lungs) and avoids label-speak. Only minor slip: no second character on page, so status/relationship crucible bullet is moot but not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s albino eyes and “consciously wild” label are vivid but never complicate his choices; the grab at the ink-smoke is the only micro-choice and it succeeds without cost or contradiction, so the ending’s resolve feels unearned. Interiority is atmospheric (“serene anger”) yet never splits him against himself. The child and mother act as stimuli, not relationship crucibles, so no status shift occurs. The 9+ quick test fails: no prior flaw or conflicting impulse makes the final vow feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—preserver vs. provocateur—is dramatized in the moment he places the letter; the cost (loss of safety, possible purge) is legible. Yet the beat is single; we see no earlier micro-choice that foreshadows this leap, so the turn feels slightly abrupt rather than accumulated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—gentle cultivator vs. hunted target—are alive in the moment she palms the knife only to sheathe it; the gesture crystallizes her pacifist rewrite of her father’s violence. Cost is felt: the bounty stays unclaimed, the father’s rose wilts, continuity chosen over cash. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the father’s turn risks convenience: his calcified worldview softens too fast for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is shown through steady breath and calm under cosmic chaos, but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized. The rail spike as keepsake hints at back-story motive yet never complicates his present choice; the final “voicing silence” feels symbolic rather than a paid-for renunciation. No micro-choice visibly costs him, so the Earned Stasis is atmospheric, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-strained caution versus the need to weaponize her father’s nib—play out in embodied beats (gloved fingers, blood-bright ink). The decision to “intervene” is earned: each letter she drafts visibly forecloses retreat and binds her to the shovel-and-printworks risk. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; the heirloom nib carries paternal accusation that sharpens her resolve. Only the journalist remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is not tested; within single-POV limits, motivation is vivid and escalation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied in the knuckle-stars and the needle; the interior contradiction between fleeing and memorializing is alive in every beat. The final tattoo sequence crystallizes a credible renunciation—he immobilizes himself with the very map of his failure—so the cost is felt on the skin. Micro-choices (pressing amber to chest, picking up the gun) keep motivation legible without therapy-speak. Only the sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; interiority alone carries the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—needing order yet feeding on the grotto’s chaos—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the flake, stilling the mandala). The final renunciation costs her the pattern she craved, but Maren’s pressure feels slightly under-motivated; a sharper prior cue would push this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—guilt over past inaction versus present compulsion to rebuild—drives every micro-choice; the moment she presses lapis into the stone, the cost (blood, kneeling labor, the name *Amira* left exposed) crystallizes her Earned Stasis. Retrocognitive burden is more label than lived constraint; we’re told it “traps” but never see it warp a present decision. Still, the single-POV embodiment is vivid and the final refusal to erase the name is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s synesthetic lens is vividly embodied (“tasted like lightning”), and his choice to spin the coin is a micro-choice that risks the garden’s magic. Liora’s ache for an encore is palpable, yet her final hand-taking feels slightly rushed—her contradictory impulse (fear of cruelty vs. hunger for hope) could be simultaneous on the page rather than serial. Still, both characters read as specific individuals, and the cost of fracturing time is felt in Elias’s worn coin and Liora’s flickering edges.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” trait is shown early and embodied in the final “Prove it” that now carries belief, a credible shift. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on sternum, paint on skin—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is Eli, who functions more as helpful prop than pressure source, flattening the relationship crucible. Still, her micro-choices (taking the placebo, painting air) earn the closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eira’s interiority is vivid—her breath, the fossil biting her palm, the heat-device flare—but the final surrender (“I don’t know how to answer”) is voiced rather than dramatized; we feel awe, not the contradictory tug that would make the fusion an earned cost. Still, her sensory-mapper identity shapes every beat, and the fossil’s burn supplies a tactile micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s quiet, cataloguing obsession is rendered through tactile micro-choices (turning the hourglass, fitting the last button) that externalize an interior contradiction: she disbelieves prophecy yet obeys its logic. The final renunciation—turning the hourglass again after sand flows upward—carries visible cost in the slowed fall and the echo’s single note, earning her Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial; no diagnostic labels intrude. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-erasure vs. responsibility—are dramatized through the micro-choice to open the pillbox and pocket the file; the scar, the key, and the ciphered snow externalize a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“his breath a silver hush”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation of the pillbox on the desk earns Earned Stasis: he forecloses the option of forgetting and accepts the burden of carrying the names forward. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interior coherence is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s stoic endurance is palpable, but the interior contradiction promised by “distill complexity into essence” never surfaces as an on-page dilemma; the final serenity feels bequeathed by weather rather than paid for by a visible choice that costs him a path. The yarn needle memory is evocative yet passive—no moment forces him to test or betray that distilled creed under storm pressure, so the arc lands as mood, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ren’s interiority is textured—his hands shaping clay while the lantern glass thrums—but the final “understanding” arrives as a summary epiphany rather than a pressured choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the closure beat, so the cost feels declared, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet endurance and the moment he hands over the bitting gauge both carry cost, but interiority drifts into summary (“the world felt too heavy”) rather than embodied contradiction; Lila’s grief is asserted, not dramatized. The final beat earns a micro-choice that forecloses his retreat into solitude, yet the emotional hierarchy between caretaker and apprentice stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s interiority is textured—her fingers “brushing” extinct engravings, the vibration “traveling up her arm”—and her micro-choice to read the scale-book crystallizes her arc. The contradiction between wanting to “coexist with the past, not be consumed” is dramatized, not declared. Yet the curator’s warning is received, not tested under pressure, so the relational crucible is absent and the final cost feels lightly weighted for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation and her need to “find the thread” give her a coherent internal drive; the twig-in-hair gesture shows embodied change. Yet her contradictory impulses (writing others’ secrets vs. hoarding her own) are stated more than dramatized in scene, and the final shift—“I just stopped looking”—is asserted rather than forced by a visible, costly choice. The keeper and artist function more as oracles than pressure sources, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Still, micro-choices (placing the paper lotus, accepting the fresh twig) land as credible renunciation with modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—breath fogging glass, trembling fingers—and her micro-choice to “give them silence” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The cautious hope is shown via the steadying breath before she activates the generator, not merely labeled. Voss functions mainly as skeptic; no real status shift occurs, so the relationship crucible is thin. Still, her flaw-driven risk (silence over force) directly enables the closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied in the opening beat and vanishes the instant wonder eclipses fear; the contradiction is left unexplored, so the arc feels toggled rather than transformed. The micro-choice to seize the compass is present, but no prior beat shows him weighing terror against curiosity, so the cost reads as plot convenience rather than earned nerve.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s synaesthetic “touch-seeing” is vivid and consistent; the ribbon beat shows motive-to-action linkage. Yet her interiority flattens in the quarry confrontation—no contradictory impulse under threat, just steady resolve—so the final acceptance of the lance feels pre-decided rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s “nervous confidence” is embodied in trembling fingers and micro-choices (turning the nail, stepping into the furnace); the contradiction is on-page. The final beat—deciding to “finish what he’d started”—carries visible cost as the station groans and alarms wail, earning the shift. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s interiority is textured—glass flake in boot, childhood boats—yet her contradictory impulses stay static; no new micro-choice under pressure re-weights the final “not-knowing.” The hitchhiker is gone, so relationship crucible never activates; motivation remains a lyrical constant rather than an engine that tightens. Closure cost is atmospheric, not character-internal, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s calm is shown through embodied beats (crouching, brushing dust, watching the fox) and the inherited pouch keeps paternal guilt tactile. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “spiral” epiphany is stated more than dramatized, muting cost. No second character on page, so status crucible waived; micro-choices still tilt his hierarchy of values toward departure, earning a modest arc.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative—"fingers trembling not from the cold"—but the decisive shift from solitary decoder to communal caller is declared rather than dramatized; we never see him weigh the personal cost of surrendering interpretive authority, so the closure feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veyra’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to the Circle vs. guilt over her kin’s massacre—are dramatized in the moment she feeds the seed her own complicity. The final image of the grown child with a knife crystallizes the cost of her guarded silence. Interiority stays concrete (“pain flared, sharp and bright”) and avoids label-speak. One hairline slip: “warlike serenity” is asserted rather than embodied just before planting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s root-bound paralysis is vivid, but the arrival of the woman collapses his agency; he never actively chooses the intersection, only assents. The scar-link method is shown once in memory and once passively touched—no micro-choice alters tactics. Interiority is atmospheric but generic (“fear, hope, anxious elation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Earned stasis is implied, yet the cost feels off-loaded onto the dream-realm rather than paid by Elias in the glade.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory yet surrendering it—are dramatized in the final beat; the cost of forgetting her brother’s voice is felt on the page. “Patchwork Girl” is more label than lived, but the embodied gesture of opening her palm sells the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak. One more micro-choice mid-scene would have pushed her to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jake’s contradictory impulses—clutching the cloth vs. selling it, craving sound vs. fearing echo—are embodied in the twitch of fingers and the bitter laugh. The pickaxe micro-choice (authenticating it for Roy) shows competence undercut by self-loathing. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; “ghost in the mix” is idiosyncratic. Closure choice to offer the cloth to Lena is credible renunciation, but the cost (public shame already spent) feels slightly under-scaled for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—glove adjustment, finger on cuneiform, deliberate seed insertion—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak; the ache at “almost brush its edges” shows contradictory tenderness and scientific detachment. The only bar to 9 is that the cost (permanent solitude? lifelong vigil?) is implied rather than dramatized on her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation to “preserve wonder in routine” is stated early and re-anchored in each book he reads aloud, but the interior contradiction between brass anchorage and human longing is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive micro-choice; the final release of the creel is credible yet feels inevitable rather than costly because no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat tightening under the crown carries cost—but the inspector’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. dissolve grief) are asserted more than dramatized in mid-action. The final self-confession lands because the pearl’s earlier weight prepped it, yet the leap from “priestess of others’ grief” to “I’m afraid of being forgotten” feels slightly convenient rather than compelled by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s guilt-sharpened interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor-free hands versus pills dilemma instantly humanizes her. The micro-choice to trace graffiti, pocket the map, and hoist the accordion shows a hierarchy of values (truth-seruvival-music) under pressure. Yet the “truth-seeking river chronicler” label is self-attributed twice without on-page evidence of new river data being gathered today; we witness archival grief, not active chronicling. Closure earns credible renunciation—she keeps drawing the “useless” map—but the beat that finally forecloses forgiveness-seeking is more asserted than dramatized, keeping the cost fractionally abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the dreamer’s cautious exuberance and scholar’s reflex to document are nicely entangled. Yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never hesitates to read the unwritten letter or resist the cipher. The final “smile” signals change but the cost is abstract; we don’t feel what freedom forfeits. Still, the micro-choice to write the second letter lands as credible renunciation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—loyalty to empire vs. dream of perforated destiny—grounds every beat; the violin’s first note forces a micro-choice that visibly costs her father’s presence. Embodied emotion is sharp (“hands numb,” “breath fogging”), yet the psychic plant chorus drifts toward label-speak (“You are the fracture”) and momentarily thins the contradiction. Still, her final renunciation carries earned weight: the coffee-stain map rewrites, she walks away, empire foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is lyrical but coherent; the beautician-mortician fusion is shown through tactile ritual, not label. Contradictory impulses (preserve beauty vs accept transience) surface in the emerald kiss, but the cost is more asserted than embodied—no micro-choice visibly backfires. Still, her final stance crystallizes with quiet renunciation, satisfying the 9+ test at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—caretaker of mosses yet still aching from forgiveness—anchors her, but the climactic “letting go” is asserted rather than embodied; the pool-voice hands her the insight instead of forcing her to mine it under pressure. Micro-choices (climbing, dipping fingers) are present yet low-stakes; no visible cost or irreversible action seals the change. The forgiveness backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so the emotional weight is borrowed, not earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “moral auditor” label is vivid, but we never watch him audit; he only listens. The mirror shard and cloak motif echo inner conflict yet Elias never acts against his own fear—he simply absorbs Veyra’s story. Veyra’s fragile certainty lands, but because Elias’s stakes never tighten, the moment feels observational rather than crucible. Interiority is atmospheric, not decision-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“afraid of failing, afraid of succeeding”) without embodied contradiction. Grandmother memory supplies motive yet arrives as summary; no micro-choice dramatizes the shift from researcher to believer. Final “presence” insight is declared, not paid for by an on-page renunciation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically textured—“breath curling into the still air like a question”—but his contradictory impulses (stay/enter) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final “smile” signals acceptance without embodied cost. The arrowhead and skimmer act on him more than he acts on them, so agency feels faint. Still, the hierarchy of values (solitude vs. initiation) is legible and the endurance of centuries lands as credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s shame and yearning are embodied in numb fingers and the dropping of the satchel; the translucent-hand beat shows internal change without label-speak. The “slow learner” epiphany is earned because the fountain memory-dive dramatizes every prior failure. Cost is present—the flower is his last drop of liquid light—yet the flower itself feels slightly convenient, muting the sting. Still, contradictory impulses (stay/leave, doubt/faith) coexist in-scene and the final renunciation is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s ritual fatigue and the key’s uncanny weight give him a concrete interior contradiction; the woman’s mirrored ache externalizes it. Yet the climactic transfer of the tag feels willed rather than wrested—no micro-choice visibly costs him anything on the page, so the renunciation reads mild.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for cosmic alignment while surrendering to uncertainty—grounds the arc; the coin micro-choices visibly trace his shift from extraction to listening. Emotions stay embodied (cold metal warming) and avoid label-speak. The final renunciation (letting purpose align with him) carries credible cost: he abandons the prophecy-as-map that defined him. Still, the lack of external pressure or secondary character keeps the crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—wanting to remember while denying he needs memory—surfaces early and charges the final renunciation. The embodied “weight of centuries pressing against his ribs” and the micro-choice of whispering stolen names give concrete access to his state. Yet the heartbreak of a reaper is asserted rather than dramatized in relationship; no second character tests him, so the crucible is purely internal and stays one-note. Still, the endurance costs him the atlas monsters and his own voice, producing a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s earnest naiveté is embodied in the drip-counting ritual and the trembling bell-lift; the interior contradiction between grand cosmic aim and micro-method is present throughout. The final laugh is brittle but earned, showing cost without tidy growth. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. Micro-choices (tilting the bell, timing drops) steadily reveal value hierarchy; flaw (inadequate heat-magic) complicates action. Closure choice—accepting imperfect song—lands via prior causality, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—erase vs. speak—co-exist in scene, but the interiority drifts into abstract “shared meaning” therapy-speak at the exact moment he pockets the photos, blunting the embodied cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—equations vs. wonder—grounds every beat; the kneel-to-plant micro-choice visibly costs her former identity. The “secretly sentimental” trait moves from label to engine when she buries the crystal, trading control for felt risk. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is waived; interior arc alone earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—observer who must now act—surfaces early and drives every tactile micro-choice (vine-harness, buckle re-thread). The final refusal to let go crystallizes a visible, bodily cost (buckle bite, gasping) that satisfies Earned Stasis. Still, the “trust” motive is asserted more than dramatized in mid-scene beats, keeping the arc just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s numbness-to-life arc is embodied in sweat, breath, sword-weight; the duplicate-brain backstory is anchored to a present micro-choice (Veyra’s twitch toward the jar). Interior contradiction—“I don’t know how to stop”—is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation of clone-vs-original identity lands with visible cost: he steps off the rock into unknown air, ego armor left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tremble, her pulse quickens—but the “notably receptive” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a contradictory moment. The childhood greenhouse memory is the only micro-choice that tilts her stance, and it arrives late; earlier she simply obeys each box. The final smile-in-the-dark turn shows earned composure, yet the cost (losing quiet life) is only implied. Still, her protective drive feels individual, not generic, keeping the score solidly mid-high.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s mournful-eager caretaker persona is embodied in the leaf-blower baton; the trembling hands and dropped pull-cord at the end show a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms”) and avoids label-speak. The only slip is the off-stage accident backstory—thin causal grounding for his obsession—but the on-page micro-choices under girl/mother gaze earn the smile and laughter, so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is evocative—“dimensionally homesick,” “make friends with uncertainty”—but the blank book beat is the only moment where contradictory impulses (write/not-write) collide on-page; until then she mostly observes. The final refusal to keep waiting registers as a shift, yet the causal chain between pendant, guardian, and that renunciation is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s buried sensitivity and twenty-year obsession are credibly embodied in acid-stained hands and tremor; the pivot from “perfection” to “breaking” is an earned interior reversal. The shard he lifts in the final beat shows visible cost—his life’s work reduced to jagged scrap—so the renunciation lands. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; interior contradiction alone drives the turn. Micro-choice to pour mercury into the exploding crucible crystallizes his new hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s obsession with “the beginning in every ending” is declared early and circles back in the final Charged Poise, giving her a coherent arc. Interiority stays concrete—tuning dials, breath fog, pulse quickening—yet never slips into cliché. The only missing torque: we see no contradictory impulse under pressure; she glides smoothly from seeker to initiate without interior resistance that would deepen cost. Still, her renunciation of physical existence feels proportionate to the length and is earned by the pattern the piece teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-choices under pressure, but interiority stays generic (“his chest tightened”) and the climactic speech is unconflicted. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the commuters’ disappearance costs him nothing and he ends unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his calm while sinking into “quicksand” shows embodied contradiction—but the thread’s agency dwarfs his; he mostly follows. The final reach is a micro-choice, yet the cost (loss of gallery world) is more implied than felt on his skin.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirien’s curiosity is anchored in tactile ritual (salvaging the link, forging lenses), but interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized—“balancedly curious” is asserted, never embodied in a moment where risk and safety pull her simultaneously. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost (alien contact, political risk, personal exposure) is gestured at rather than felt on the page. Competence outweighs visible mistakes; the arc lands cleanly but without lingering asymmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s “persistently curious” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—kneeling, palm to floor, adjusting the aid—each escalating risk. The interior contradiction between fear and compulsion is embodied, not labeled. Final smile is credible renunciation, but Miriam remains a symbol rather than a relationship crucible, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s trembling fingers, claustrophobia, and decision to kneel rather than join give a charged, embodied arc; the “stand by the unremembered” motive is shown only in final gesture, so the cost is felt but not deeply textured in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s borrowed-time guilt and heartbeat-counting compulsion are concrete and embodied; the porcelain shard handled in two beats anchors filial grief. The final renunciation—accepting he is “the space between mistakes”—is earned by the ghost’s pressure and the shard’s last touch. Interior contradiction is present but mild: no moment where guilt and relief collide in a single action. Still, the micro-choice to stop counting and pocket the shard visibly costs him, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—capture echoes as tactile memory—stays consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract gloss (“she didn’t believe in curses, only in patterns”) without bodily contradiction; the final beat registers triumph yet no micro-cost is shown on her, so the endurance feels performative rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s obsession with “the hum” and his refusal to release the phone give him a clear, escalating motive. Interiority is concrete—arrowhead burns, fingers translucent—yet the final beat drifts toward aphorism (“punchline”) rather than embodied cost, muting the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the orchard vs. seizing beauty—are dramatized in her body under pressure (hand clutching the shell while bowing). The locust-shell mimicry is an earned micro-choice that forecloses her old life; the bruised landing on rusted metal makes the cost visible. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers already tightening”) rather than abstract. Voice stays coherent across shards; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jace’s worn-mailman fatigue and Mira’s half-starved defiance read through concrete gesture and history-laden objects; the thunderstorm bottle refusal crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays spare, never diagnostic, and the final beat of “carrying a little longer” earns credible Earned Stasis. Minor slip: the smuggler-helper motive is asserted not tested in-scene, so the cost feels generalized rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s silence-as-language and “quietly persistent” trait are shown through tactile micro-choices (tracing the horse, pocketing the halo, mounting the carousel); the final laugh is a credible release. Missing is an interior contradiction that complicates his decision—he never hesitates, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than existential. Still, the endurance/renunciation of exile lands with visible price: he forfeits return, letting the carousel spin him “home” into the vanished crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is sketched through tactile micro-choices (reshelving, sniffing the scarf), but the decisive leap—donning the scarf and crossing the threshold—lacks prior interior contradiction; the risk/cost of abandoning his post is only lyrically implied, not dramatized. The woman remains a symbol; her recognition line supplies expository symmetry rather than fresh pressure. Earned stasis is gestured at but not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet longing is embodied in micro-choices (painting light, borrowing the camera), but the final “Not yet” lacks a visible cost or contradiction; the interior shift feels more declared than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s paralysis and the locksmith’s quiet resolve are sketched through gesture and object-handling rather than label-speak, but the story withholds any interior contradiction or micro-choice from the locksmith during the ritual; his decision to “tell it” arrives without visible cost or struggle, so the arc feels gift-wrapped rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and grief are vivid, but the sister-memory reveal is delivered in a single expository lump rather than dramatized micro-choices; the final reach is reflex, not a value-laden decision, so the cost feels adjacent rather than internal.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven self-exile and her need to mentor without words are clear, but the moment she lets Mira lift the cup is more facilitator than crucible; we see protective tenderness, not a visible cost that forecloses her own retreat. The contradictory impulse (stay vs. save) is named, not enacted under pressure; the final beat leaves her stance essentially unchanged, so the arc feels suspended rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s grief for lost wonder is embodied in the tremor of her hands at the end, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“bridge,” “thread,” “cathedral”) that tells us the emotional arithmetic rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The only micro-choice that costs her is the sustained song; everything else—planting, touching bark, exhaling—reads as ritual confirmation of what she already intends. Because the travelers’ echoes supply the decisive magic, her agency is observational, so the renunciation feels gentle rather than freighted with a visible price. Still, her tactile intimacy with the tree and the orchard’s history keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—restorer vs liberator—are dramatized in the needle-stab moment; the embodied tremor, cracked spectacles, and dream-haunted backstory make his final breach feel earned. Interiority stays concrete (“breath misting,” “voices rising like smoke from cracks in his own mind”) and avoids label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the Fisher King’s one-line warning, while atmospheric, is too slight to test Elias’s hierarchy of values under live counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is embodied in tactile map handling and the decision to pry the chapel, but the interior contradiction—why this risk now?—is asserted rather than dramatized. The final recognition (“the story was not yet finished”) lands as label, not embodied cost. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the micro-choice to enter darkness carries visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet analytic habit and lifelong intimacy with death are shown through tactile choices—tucking the globe, flipping ledger pages under water—so motive stays embodied. The final release of the globe is credibly foreshadowed by his earlier reverence and the growing sense that possession = entanglement. Interior contradiction is light: we get proximity to death but little fear or resistance, so the arc feels slightly monochrome. Still, the renunciation costs him the “last transmission,” a tangible forfeiture that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—music as instinct, silence as itch—yet the decisive moment (pressing the bolt-plate into the ghost) is externally prompted, not wrestled from contradictory impulse; the cost is felt but not internally foreshadowed, so the arc reads as tender rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s curiosity is vivid and embodied; the diary beat forces a visible micro-choice that costs her the goggles. Interiority stays concrete, but the final renunciation reads slightly tidy—no lingering contradiction after the captain’s warning. Still, the endurance of leaving both diary and goggles behind carries felt cost and aligns with her established warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s grief-anchored obsession with cloud-taxonomy is vivid and embodied; the trembling hands, the logbook smudge, the final rail-climb all externalize interior fracture. Contradictory impulses—clinging to memory vs. letting go—coexist in the same beats, culminating in a credible Earned Stasis leap. The father-wound motive is telegraphed early and paid off, though the marriage/father double backstory slightly crowds the 700-word canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s prosopagnosia is rendered through concrete perceptual tics—collarbone light, gait rhythm—that cleanly motivate her negative-space portraiture; the final refusal to possess the sketch crystallizes her established values with visible cost. Interiority stays specific, never lapsing into diagnostic labels. The lone weakness: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the arc is a straight confirmation of traits rather than a pressured test.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s curiosity is shown through tactile action (tracing charts, copying scratches) and a visible micro-choice (sneaking out at night). Interiority stays concrete, but the final “grin” is performed, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the beat feels single-note. Still, the earned cartographer moment carries credible cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s want-to-mend motive is concrete and returns at every beat; the mirrors force micro-choices that reveal hierarchy-of-values. Interiority stays sensory (“metallic whispers,” “gears hummed”) rather than diagnostic. Final “bridge” self-definition is earned by causal chain, but emotional contradiction is muted—no moment where repair-urge collides with fear of becoming the clockmaker—so the arc feels single-note rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s gardener identity and refusal to fade are cleanly anchored; her interiority stays concrete (“watered the flowers in her own way”). The villagers’ shift from hoarding to sharing is shown through visible acts, not labels. Yet the ghost’s agency is mostly observational; she never faces a true contradiction or cost that would deepen her arc. Closure is resonant but not character-costly—she simply lets go once success is assured.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s trembling fingers, lifelong vigil, and final steady breath embody a believable arc; the puppet head as cracked mirror of self is concrete and charged. Interiority stays particular—no label-speak—and the renunciation to “soothe, not save” crystallizes under pressure with visible cost (the clock hands dissolve). The only micro-slip: “he understood” is a touch expository just before the climax, but the next sentence re-anchors through image. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses (preserve world vs release it) act in-scene and the final stance is causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s reluctant guardianship is viscerally embodied—her fingers brushing the withered bark, the stone of guilt in her chest—yet the interior contradiction between contempt for the lost and the curse’s demand for balance stays mostly asserted. The decisive micro-choice (scattering the nuts rather than guiding by touch) crystallizes her values, but the beat lands late; earlier beats show endurance more than active hierarchy. Still, the cost of another night’s survival is felt in the frost-silvered, inedible fruit, earning a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lina’s regret is palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“she had come here to atone”) rather than embodied contradiction. The foam insight is sharp, yet the turn from chemist-control to river-flexibility feels announced, not dramatized in a micro-choice that costs her something right there. The sister memory supplies motive but no on-page relationship pressure, so the arc lands as introspective summary rather than crucible-tested change.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s want—to locate “where stories begin”—is stated early and orients every beat; his micro-choice to sell the moonlight for a sigh-coin visibly costs him the bottle and rewrites his premise. Interiority stays concrete (“cool pulse of something older than words”), but the woman’s motives remain opaque, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only one-sided. The final smile registers as earned renunciation because the prior beats link the bottle’s absence to the reopened door. Still, no contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously; the arc is linear acceptance rather than split desire.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s tactile grief-skill and Kael’s contagious sorrow are embodied in every beat; the shared hand-clasp turns memory into visceral cost. Interiority stays concrete (“phantom ache…clinging to her bones”) and the final stance—carrying pain without drowning—earns its keep through prior micro-choices. Minor slip: “sturdy brittle” is repeated label-speak at the climax, blunting the edge of contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—restorer of machines vs. builder of community—surfaces only in summary; we never see her hesitate or pay an embodied cost when she pivots from gears to choir. The final smile is unearned because no on-page moment forces her to relinquish a private want. Still, her grandfather’s weight and multilingual past give her credible roots.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—obsession vs. the fear of inheriting another’s despair—are dramatized in the mirror-handling beats; the final refusal to erase the cracks is earned. Interiority stays concrete, but “helix-minded” remains a label never embodied in syntax or action. Emotional cost is felt, yet the micro-choice hierarchy could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—“prism-minded archivist” refracts through sensory detail—but her motives stay abstract: “find forgotten combinations” never sharpens into a personal stake. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she simply proceeds. The final recognition (“guardian of thresholds”) is asserted, not paid for by an on-page choice that costs her anything. Still, the perceptual filter is consistent and character-specific, keeping the score north of midline.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile obsession with wood-sound is vivid and embodied; the final micro-choice—wedging the insulator and striking—pays off his trait. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only limit: no contradictory impulse is allowed to complicate the beat, so the arc is linear rather than fracturing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s exile and teaching past give him texture; the stone’s dent anchors a specific memory of pity. His decision to stay is credible because the scene has shown silence yielding a usable pattern. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final micro-choice costs him the solitary life he knew. Still, we never see him actually misplay or teach a board, so “chess tutor” remains asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s pacifist-tinkerer identity is embodied in the solder-scented workshop and the gentle refusal of force; his micro-choice to “listen with his hands” shows a consistent, character-specific sensorium. The return of Liora lands as credible renunciation rather than reunion: she offers the tuning fork that completes his experiment, proving her earlier silence was not abandonment but parallel research. Interior contradiction is present—yearning versus residual hurt—yet the emotional cost is slightly under-dramatized in their single beat of reunion, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s drive is vivid—green-stained fingers, seed cradled like contraband—but the interior contradiction never bites. She never hesitates, sniffs danger, or weighs the elders’ warning against her own ambition; the grandmother’s journal simply confirms her. Because no micro-choice on the page actually risks anything (she pockets the seed, sketches, talks), the final “understanding” feels handed, not earned. Cost is asserted (“years to bloom”) rather than dramatized, so the arc lands as gentle affirmation, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—gloved fingers, warm arrow tip—yet the climactic “understanding” is declared, not dramatized: “Resilience wasn’t about resisting change…” strips embodied cost. Still, her micro-choice to stay kneeling while gravity flips shows a visible wager, earning the Earned Stasis closure with skin in the game.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s investigator mindset is credibly etched—his documenting reflex, the repurposed scanner, the patch as talisman—but the interior contradiction promised in the “foresight” mantra stays verbal; no moment forces him to choose between data and instinct, so the arc flattens into competent witnessing rather than earned renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eira’s synesthetic gift is embodied in the way colors fracture under the chisel strikes; her motive—“certify wonder as essential”—is declared rather than dramatized, but the final white-note that stills the sculptor shows a credible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, so the score hinges on solo interior arc, which earns its tightening but not full contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s guilt and curiosity are palpable, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“harvest insights from that failure”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from sealing to weaving is credible because the flute’s warmth and the shadow-figure’s cue have been physically prepared. Still, we never see Elias wrestle with a live moral or tactical choice—he obeys instructions once the threshold is crossed. Cost is implied, not felt; the beat remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession with emotional mathematics is vivid, but the borrowed-personality trait stays ornamental; no micro-choice shows it altering tactics or exacting cost. The final hollowed-out state is legible, yet the causal path is blurred because the fragment dissolves without forcing him to decide anything. Interiority is textured, but the poet/mathematician voices are asserted rather than embodied in action. Still, the specificity of ink-stained fingers and the rib-barnacle image keeps him above the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courier’s trembling hands and the pendant’s hum give us embodied stakes, but interiority stays generic (“wonder settled into her bones”). The final inward step is earned, yet her contradictory impulses (deliver vs. keep) are told rather than dramatized in scene. Mentor absence motivates but never complicates her on-page choice. Still, the micro-choice to turn inward supplies visible cost and lifts the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his breath, numb fingers, prism memory—but the decisive turn (“Objects did absorb emotions, but not like sponges…”) is delivered as summative epiphany rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice shows him risking or forfeiting anything, so the renunciation feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to silence yet answering the call—surfaces early and tightens through embodied beats (wrapping the damp shawl, pressing the bead to her ear). The final renunciation costs her the orchard and the loom; causality holds. One hairline slip: “she understood then” moment is slightly label-like, blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet resolve is shown through tactile ritual—tracing ore veins, coaxing living silk into stone—so the “meek” label is embodied rather than asserted. Interior contradiction is light: we’re told a “fire” burns, but the only on-page tension is steady diligence, not clashing impulses. The final stance shift (straighter shoulders, louder hammer) is proportionate to the length and feels earned because the costly all-night labor is dramatized. Still, no second character appears, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are absent, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—dream-pull, shard-hum, scanner readings—but the final choice is asserted, not dramatized: we never see him weigh the cost of redirecting the flow versus letting truth stay hidden. The scarred double’s warning (“Some truths aren’t meant to be weighed”) supplies the only external pressure, so the closing decision feels imported, not earned from contradictory impulses shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief is anchored in the tactile ritual with the sea glass; every beat of stacking stones is a micro-choice that externalizes his need to “bottle safety.” The final surrender of the glass to the spiral shows a visible cost—he leaves behind the last fragment of his daughter—earning the shift from isolation to communion. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak intrudes. The only limit is that the anonymous correspondent remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s ink-stained past and present star-weaving give her a sharp, specific interior; the mirrored gesture with the ink-fingered woman crystallizes her drive. Yet the laugh-as-key never collides with a contradictory impulse—no moment where joy falters or costs her anything on the page—so the arc feels performative rather than pressured. The final “step into the light” is foreshadowed but not earned by a prior micro-choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dye master’s watchfulness is concrete—tracing the wing, tracking sun trails—but his interior contradiction (restlessness vs. stillness) is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat. The final “search is over” feels handed to him by the shimmering map rather than earned by a micro-choice that costs him something visible. No relational crucible is tested; the traveler functions as oracle, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s numb-hand healing and final quiet acceptance register as embodied change, but interiority drifts into abstract “quantified sorrow” talk; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the turn feels declared rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive is legible—restore dawns to save the realm—but interiority stays generic (“her throat tight,” “heart ached”) and never fractures under contradiction. The keeper’s dialogue supplies thematic exposition instead of forcing Elara to test belief; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs her anything until she kneels to plant. The ending song relies on communal participation that the page hasn’t earned from her prior isolation, so the shift feels eased rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s regret over the woman is embodied in the ache that “never quite healed,” and the invitation forces a micro-choice that finally externalizes his empathy. The interior contradiction—devotion to rules vs. compulsion to follow—drives the beat that sends him into the night. Cost is legible: he forfeits the safety of marginal life. Yet the beat count is thin; one more pressured moment before departure would have shown the trait altering tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through an on-page contradiction or micro-choice; the bread-eating is passive, the seed-planting is obedient. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“weight in his chest felt lighter”) rather than embodied tension. No contradictory impulse is acted out under pressure, so the final gesture feels granted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s meticulous-care trait is shown through glove-adjusting and dial-turning, but interiority stays general (“his chest tightened”) and the vow-recognition epiphany is declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the final commitment reads as single-note uplift rather than costly renunciation. Still, the motivation arc is coherent and stakes feel personal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s lineage is signaled early and her father’s watch fob anchors memory, but interiority stays safe: “unease coiling,” “pulse pounded,” no embodied contradiction under knife-point. The final stance—delaying betrayal rather than stopping it—reads as competent calculation, not costly renunciation; the brass token persuades but doesn’t visibly tax her. Competent, not yet crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s skepticism and inherited glow give her a sharp, specific interior; the final beat of tightening her fingers around the ring shows a micro-choice that costs her the safety of disbelief. The man’s instant recognition of her taste-quirk, however, flattens his mystery into exposition and robs her of discovering her own limits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s memory gift and subterranean exile are vivid, but his interior contradiction—why the laughter compels him to “bring them home”—is asserted rather than dramatized. The final step through the golden door feels willed by the story, not by a visible internal split that costs him anything we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—precision vs. the tremor after refusing forgery—grounds her; the postal plate and map beats give her two micro-choices that tilt her stance. Yet the climb-down to the Echo Vault is still summary; we don’t yet feel her body pay a concrete price, so the final resolve hasn’t fully earned its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s muteness and vocation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“the world below had forgotten how to speak”). The final act—shattering a child’s toy to feed the sculpture—carries cost, yet the choice is reported rather than dramatized, blunting the felt price and capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s contradictory drives—caretaker duty vs. need for self-erasure—are dramatized in the final immolation; the rusted-gear vial embodies obsolescence fear that spins faster under pressure, earning the Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“static crackling like distant thunder”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice of placing the box beneath the burning bush visibly costs him his sanctuary, sealing a credible arc within word count.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “listening” trait is established early and pays off in her restraint at the climax, but she never makes a high-stakes choice that costs her anything; the emotional heavy-lifting is off-loaded to Clara. Interiority is atmospheric rather than contradictory, so the arc is flat. The micro-choice to withhold the locket is gentle but not irreversible, keeping the characterization pleasant yet un-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to decrypt yet fearing raw chance—surface in the dice hesitation and journal flip, but Kael’s ghost-dance supplies too much external choreography; her final “calm defiance” is asserted rather than embodied through a micro-choice that costs her something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlowe’s grief-riven obsession is palpable; the wildflowers, coffee dregs, and journal anchor contradictory impulses—forget vs recover—under escalating pressure. The final step toward the chamber’s gravity well is credibly foreshadowed, yet the interior contradiction could be sharper in the moment he decides to “answer” the whale; it edges toward declaration rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The summoner’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays in one emotional register; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in-scene. Micro-choices are missing: he folds, exhales, releases—each is calm, none narrows or costs. The prophecy-as-wound idea is evocative yet never tested against an alternative action, keeping motivation static.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief and curiosity read concretely through weekly ritual and the pocketed seal; the contradiction between solitude and need for connection is quietly embodied. Mira’s “patiently nimble” interrogation is shown only once, not sustained across beats, so the trait never alters tactics on-page. The final shared resolve lands as credible renunciation of the lie, but the cost is stated rather than felt in gesture or consequence. Interiority stays specific, yet the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cooked—no bodily register of the “weight lifting.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief and guarded hope feel embodied in the trembling fingers and nightly pilgrimage; the interior contradiction between skepticism and longing is alive. Yet the final beat—"I’m not afraid anymore"—is asserted, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that proves the shift. The sister’s ghostly resolve is vivid, but her agency overshadows Elias’s, so his change feels lightly earned. Still, the hierarchy of values (memory vs. safety) is legible and costs are implied.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lian’s contradictory impulses—vengeance versus self-release—are dramatized in the final beat when she chooses forgiveness yet still detonates Vey’s legacy; the embodied tremor of her fingers and the blood-prick from the thorn give visceral cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The heritage rose thorn and key function as extensions of her internal split, forcing a micro-choice that visibly forecloses her old life. One minor slip: “unlinking herself from the past” is told, not shown mid-scene, blunting the fullest possible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s longing is lyrically sketched, but her interior contradiction—why she risks joining Veyan—never crystallizes in a single, pressured micro-choice. The shell’s pull is asserted, not embodied; we see no moment where her body betrays caution. The final assent feels gentle rather than costly, so the arc lands as mood, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her skepticism, her methodical dream-collecting, her refusal to speak the final truth all emerge through embodied beats. The “salvager of echoes” self-label is the only diagnostic-speak slip, but it is brief and early. Her renunciation at the end is earned: every shard of evidence she gathers makes silence the costly, legible choice. Contradictory impulses (hunger for truth vs respect for the dead) coexist in-scene when she cups the globe and still walks away.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ren’s quiet philosopher-mender persona is consistent, but the interior contradiction promised by “demure audacity” is only asserted, never dramatized in a micro-choice; the final invitation to Mei is sweet but cost-free, so the arc feels more mood-shift than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s drive to “excavate truth” is declared early and re-iterated, but interiority stays at mission-statement level; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final choice to accept the stranger’s help is causally linked to prior beats yet carries no embodied cost—he never hesitates, filters clog, or fears radiation exposure. Relationship with the stranger is pure alliance, no status friction, so the crucible test is waived. Enough motive coherence for 7-band, but the absence of a micro-choice that costs him something keeps it below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s envy-of-Kael motive is declared, not embodied; the only embodied beat is the trembling glove on the cobalt glass. The final claim of leadership lands without prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives, so the cost feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s longing to “translate what’s left behind” is consistent, but the interior contradiction between exile and legacy never collides in a single, embodied beat; the girl’s arrival supplies outside validation rather than forcing a cost-laden choice, so the arc feels observed, not forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied (cold burn, trembling fingers) and drives the final plunge; the scavenger’s shift from defiance to awe externalizes the key’s cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the renunciation (“learning to carry the weight”) is earned. Yet the brother-storm regret is only asserted, not dramatized, so the absolution feels slightly under-causal.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—impatience vs patience dramatized through tactile ice tests and the refusal to draw his knife—but the arrival of the second figure compresses relationship pressure into a single handshake; no contradictory impulses play out between them on the page, so the crucible never ignites. The final choice to “turn toward the lake” reprises earlier imagery yet costs nothing visible; it’s a stance, not a renunciation with sting.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s investigator identity is signaled early and motivates the inciting intrusion into the tunnel, but his shift from passive observer to active resistor is declared rather than embodied; the final “I’ll give him a war” is still largely rhetorical, so the cost of that turn remains conceptual, not felt. Interiority is solid—smell of rust clings, lantern weight grows—but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; once Voss is overheard, Elias proceeds without hesitation or error. Competence is balanced with fear, yet the mistake that could raise stakes never materializes; the lantern guides, but never misleads or exacts price. The grandmother line is evocative, yet its instruction is never tested by a moment where Elias must choose to hide the light or risk exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied (the heart’s ticking as “metronome for guilt”), and his decision to act is credibly foreshadowed. The internal contradiction—priest of forgiveness now needing justice—drives every beat. Kael remains functional, but the single-scene focus keeps relational pressure minimal yet sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession with the bell is visceral and embodied; the arrow-tip talisman and acid-scarred fingers ground his daredevil lineage. Internal contradiction—knowing the bell is futile yet needing to ring it—drives every micro-choice. The final pull costs the workshop’s life and his own future, a renunciation earned by lifelong momentum. Veyra is sketched only as foil, so relationship crucible stays thin.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lena’s motivation is clear and personal, but her interiority slips into generic “truth-seeker” shorthand (“the archive had already changed her”). The decisive act—copying the video—lacks a visible, immediate cost; we’re told danger exists but don’t feel it constrain her fingers on the keyboard.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s “courageous anomaly” is asserted but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse; the interiority is poetic but generic (“weight in his chest lifted”). The final act—hurling the shard—aligns with stated motive, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a competing value, so the change feels pre-declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s shift from voyeuristic death-tourist to volunteer is sketched via two embodied beats—accepting the clipboard, feeling the parasol tip in lining—so the renunciation carries cost. Interiority stays concrete (“skin felt thinner”) and avoids label-speak. Yet the contradiction between seeking “his own ending” and finding “others’” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the hierarchy-of-values test.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s pruning-rough hands, the letter’s ash on her skin, and the micro-choice to watch the bus leave give embodied contradiction; the final hand-brush is earned. Yet the interior line “I finally understood that love isn’t about fitting perfectly” drifts into diagnostic-speak, softening the peak beat and keeping her from a full 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The half-masked line walker’s honesty is anchored in embodied beats (mask warmth, tremor in chest) and drives the climax choice to “let the echo pass through.” Interior contradiction is thin—he questions but never truly resists—so the arc feels more confirmation than transformation, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s calm is shown through tactile ritual, but the interior contradiction promised by “subtle puzzle archivist” never surfaces as an on-page dilemma; the arc is gentle acceptance rather than a costly renunciation. The final beat—smiling at the dove—reads as tranquil resolution without visible price or path foreclosed. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the change feels observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reticence and reverence for knowledge are shown through tactile ritual, not label. The crystal test sequences give him micro-choices (whisper, hum, press to temple) that escalate commitment, and the final “silence is not absence” realization costs him his prior scholarly detachment—an earned shift. Interiority stays concrete, though the emotional contradiction between obsession and scholarly restraint could be sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet’s “precognitive forgetfulness” is dramatized through the chalk, tape, and spiral, giving us embodied stakes, but his interiority flirts with label-speak (“tightened,” “echo he’d been clinging to”) and the final step forward feels lightly motivated—he pockets items rather than acting upon their cost. Micro-choices (drawing, placing sticks) show hierarchy of values, yet the woman does most of the explanatory lifting, muting the contradiction we need in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession with “harnessing the ephemeral” is vivid and embodied in trembling fingers, the luminous ache, the clutching of the photograph. The interior contradiction—repair-man turned cosmic thief—drives every micro-choice (prying the chronometer, swapping shutter for clock hand). No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A. Final endurance (pod eject while station dies) carries visible cost; the arc lands as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored steadiness and Lena’s serene directive form a believable crucible; the broken-vinyl shard in his pocket and her matching piece externalize shared history and motivate the final gesture. Interiority stays concrete (“his fingers brushing against the piece…”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to reunify the shards is earned, carries visible cost in the hush that follows, and crystallizes their bond without sentimentality. Only the “decisively kind” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s curiosity is clear, but her interiority stays generic: “she understood,” “she smiled” substitute for embodied contradiction. The key turn—accepting shadow reclamation—lacks micro-choice dramatized on the page; agency is asserted, not shown. No cost stains her body or future; she exits unchanged except for knowledge. The journal/hand that isn’t human hints at status tension, yet no second character applies live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s “forgiving skeptic” stance is shown through her staying after the substitute body surfaces and her readiness to kneel and dig for more teeth; the interiority is concrete (“skin prickle with the shrewdly innocent question: What if?”). Yet the climactic choice—taking the child’s hand—reads more as symbolic acceptance than a costly renunciation; the prior beats never force her to sacrifice or foreclose an alternative, so the arc feels emotionally resolved rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s grief and need for atonement are vivid; the sea-glass pocketing and wading are embodied micro-choices. Yet the interior contradiction between reckless past and cautious present is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene, and the final stance (“let them shine without consuming her”) resolves without a visible flaw-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s watchful, note-taking stance is credibly embodied; Mira’s quietly proactive honey offerings give her agency without speech. Interiority stays concrete (“flinched when their mother hugged her”) and the final hand-off shows a micro-choice that alters their relational state. However, the voicemail-erasure backstory is told in summary, so the stakes feel inherited rather than personally re-earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s guilt toward his half-formed protagonist gives a sharp internal contradiction; the shell presses his palm, embodying the cost. Yet his “conflicted” label is announced, not dramatized, and the final turn—“learn”—is advice, not a choice we see him enact on the page. Interiority is vivid but stays reflective; no micro-choice in the river alters his real-time options, so the arc feels observed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her giddy laugh and pocketed leaf show embodied emotion—but the story never lets her doubt or fear; she glides from curiosity to certainty without contradictory impulse, so the final “choice” costs her nothing and feels pre-approved rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—burner who longs to preserve—grounds every beat; the final origami ignition crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (tracing empty space, folding the jar) enact the trait “patience physically” and foreclose his old art. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is waived; solo arc suffices at this length. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts the next action, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s peripheral focus and tactile obsession with light/angles are vividly embodied; the final renunciation—letting the harvested echoes go—earns its poignancy because his prior micrometer adjustments on the timer show a man who hoards control. Interior contradiction is present yet thin: we see the desire to “store wonder” but almost no on-page fear of loss or failure that would sharpen stakes. The boy-avatar is a lovely externalized self, but the transfer of agency (boy touches timer → gears spin) robs Elias of a final micro-choice under pressure, nudging the score below the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is textured—her breath curling into cold, the way she lets the thorn-coil bite without flinching—but the “years collecting burdens” backstory is delivered in one expository slab and never crystallizes into a contradictory on-page impulse; the final release feels more ordained than earned because we haven’t seen her earlier refusal to relinquish these weights.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the costume-widow identity while testing the blade—play out in embodied micro-choices (thumb on grain, first hesitant cut). The final renunciation of “harvesting lessons” is earned by the causal chain of carving; the cost is the visible lion that is both here and gone. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels. One hairline slip: “rust-hued peace” edges toward color-tag shorthand, but it is absorbed by the final sip.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is textured—regret as “damp mist,” the camera wheel still warm—yet the decisive renunciation (letting the wheel sink) is under-motivated; no prior beat shows her ready to surrender that talisman. The ghost’s accusation “You took too long” lands as label-speak without embodied cost, blunting the emotional spike. Micro-choices are present but clustered in exposition; only the final dip of fingers into lagoon dramatizes shift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s curiosity-driven interiority is concrete early (“weight of her curiosity pressing against her ribs”), but the decisive turn—choosing to pocket the sextant and later sketch the greenhouse—rests more on thematic echo than on a visible internal cost; the final acceptance of the blueprint feels lightly earned because her prior flaw/limits are never dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet grief and avoidance are credibly embodied in his bench ritual and nighttime vigil; the micro-choice to invite the girl in cracks his armor and tracks. The final kneel at the forecourt registers as earned renunciation because the music-box repair and the bear’s nudge have already forced a visible softening. Interiority stays concrete—oil-and-parchment skin, trembling girl hands—never drifting into label-speak. Flaws (risk-aversion, mother-haunting) actively shape the yes/no to the bear and the kneel, so the closure cost feels proportionate to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    The seeker’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. theft, curiosity vs. dread—are dramatized in the mirror beat: he pries the crate while telling himself “salvage was not theft,” then lifts the mirror despite its impossible weight. Interiority stays concrete (“sundial pressed against his thigh,” “breath catching”), and the final recognition of his warped reflection carries visible cost: the needle abandons north, foreclosing his lifelong compass. The only slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“hindsight clarity was a cruel gift”) that momentarily abstracts the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is rendered through tactile, embodied micro-choices (tracing rope, pocketing fulgurite), but the interior contradiction—why this rope matters more than any other—never sharpens into a visible trade-off or risk; the final smile feels lightly earned because no alternative path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s grief-stricken vocation is vivid, but her interiority alternates between lyric summary and diagnostic label (“hollowed out”) without embodied contradiction in the garden moment. The stolen thread micro-choice is present, yet the stakes jump from souvenir to kingdom-healing without an intermediate beat that shows her risking anything tangible now. The final renunciation—keep writing, keep burying herself—lands as a restatement of opening stasis rather than a new cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—mechanical hubris vs. lyrical need—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (trembling fingers, cradling the egg). The final renunciation of the contraption for lullaby is earned by prior causal failures and carries visible cost: the palace still groans, his voice is “off-key and broken,” beauty’s return is fragile. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible inert, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—protecting the child while exposing her own wound—surface only in soft dialogue; the interior clash is asserted, not embodied. The coin as paternal relic is handled twice but never tests her vocation or forecloses an option; cost is thematic, not dramatized. Still, her tactile attention to sand and scar keeps the portrait above generic “healer” cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skeptical intellect vs. ache for the grandmother—surface in the fountain moment, but the interior shift is declared (“memories aren’t just stories… anchors”) rather than embodied in a micro-choice that costs her something visible. The key turn is present yet bloodless; we see no bodily risk, forfeiture, or irreversible action that makes the descent sting. Earned, but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—sentimental preservation vs. generational rupture—are dramatized in the gear-press micro-choice; the final renunciation of fire costs him Kael’s immediate allegiance and is legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“teeth biting into his skin”) and avoids label-speak. The single-scene crucible with Kael forces a visible shift in their status dynamic: weapons down, silence up. Missing only a hairline deeper glimpse of what “light without fire” personally costs Elias beyond the grandson’s glare.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s meditative patience and grief are palpable through embodied detail (chisel scrape, ribbon warmth). Yet his interior contradiction—skepticism vs. longing for spectral contact—stays summary; we never see a micro-choice that risks belief or refusal. The final “smile and recitation” is too tidy; the cost of accepting mentorship is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the occupation-specific gestures and lavender-scented memory keep him individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s compulsive quarter-turn life and the etched-confession rake give a concrete, idiosyncratic interior; the final transfer of every name onto the bob shows a visible cost and turns self-flagellation into communal burden, earning credible change. The “ethically diligent” trait is dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling to read, pressing brass, climbing spray-slick rock) rather than labels. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the arc feels slightly single-track, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet hunger to “hear the dead” is embodied in tactile gardening gestures and the micro-choice to plant roses at the end; the interior contradiction between blithe caretaker and lonely listener is palpable. The final renunciation—accepting Margaret’s story as his own—carries visible cost in the midnight vigil, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: “longed to hear their voices” drifts toward label-speak, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her hesitation before the first stroke embodies the cost of authorship—but the “predictive model” is asserted, not dramatized, so her final smile feels slightly unearned. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; the choice to write is never truly endangered. Still, her profession and the quill’s weight give her a memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is sketched through tactile detail—ink-stained fingers, the jar of dust—so his turn from passive listener to active “teacher of dust” feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only missing layer is a simultaneous contradictory impulse under peak pressure; his resolve hardens but never collides with an on-page doubt, so the cost is more observed than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals—ashes mixed into pigment, fingers on frames—yet the interior contradiction between clinging and letting-go never crystallizes into a single irreversible choice; the mask moment is vivid but the final discard feels pre-decided rather than paid for. The promised “fleeting emotion” stays abstract; we see the chase, not the slip. Closure costs are implied, not felt on the skin.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s “ink-stained fingers” and sewer exile give a vivid thumbnail, but interiority soon turns abstract (“refusing to let the past be smoothed over”). The decisive turn—surfacing to confront the fishermen—rests on a single sentence of resolve without showing contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices under pressure are missing between the cog study and the climb out, so the final cost feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Miss Voss’s interiority is restrained and consistent; her “quiet certainty” is shown through calm micro-choices (placing the zither, sustaining the note) rather than label-speak. The choir members move from stock types toward individuated voices, but Maren’s pivot is still reported rather than embodied in a visible beat. The final renunciation—she came to listen, not teach—carries cost, yet the causal chain feels lightly sketched because the hatred is dissolved off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s grief-driven quest is vivid, but interiority drifts into abstractions (“felt whole”) that short-circuit embodied contradiction; the final renunciation of remaining seeds is earned yet the cost is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness is a vivid constraint that activates twice—first when he blurts “Just a box” and again when he swallows the admission that the riddle chose him. These micro-choices under Maren’s gaze show contradictory impulses (obey rules vs. keep wonder) and cost him authority. The final strike is credibly motivated by the prior beats, but the interior contradiction could be sharper in the moment he decides to trespass.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—cataloguing the unremarkable, pocketing the orris shard—and his embodied dread (“pulse loud in his ears”) is felt. Yet the decisive moment (slipping the shard) is under-motivated: we’re told he “didn’t know what he expected,” so the choice reads exploratory rather than compelled, softening the cost that closure claims.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The diver’s interiority is concrete—tightening fingers, hitched breath—and her micro-choice to insert the ampoule crystallizes the arc. Yet the statue’s “incisively kind” trait is asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to its guidance, so the beat feels slightly safe. Still, the final refusal of triumph lands with earned weight because her earlier certainty is dramatized. Characterization stays within one POV, no head-count issues.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “grim optimism” is asserted but never embodied in contradictory action; the dice roll is the only micro-choice and its emotional cost is abstract. Interiority stays in paraphrase (“breath steady,” “breath catching”) rather than specific bodily experience. No internal contradiction is dramatized under pressure, so the final endurance feels pre-ordained, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s insomnia and methodical hope are credibly embodied through the repetitive act of painting strangers from moon-lit daydreams; her quiet renunciation of sleep and the decision to gift the portraits carry visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the arc leans on accumulation rather than a single high-pressure choice, so the change feels gentle, not crucible-forged. No contradictory impulses play out simultaneously in scene; the stakes scale to lyric mode, yet remain modest. Meets the 9+ threshold for interior specificity and embodied emotion, but falls short of explosive transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora’s grief for lost craft is vivid, but her contradictory impulses (save the past / doubt anything can be saved) stay summary; the loaf-choice costs her nothing and the “V” feels inherited, not earned. Interiority is atmospheric, not decision-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s obsession with reversing time is vivid—his thumb on the stone, the yoyo wound “like vertebrae”—but the final beat of “choice” is declared, not dramatized; we see no new micro-choice after the world rewinds, only a smile and a repeated drop. Interior contradiction is strong early (hunger vs. hubris) yet the cost is felt more by the landscape than by his body, so the arc hovers at strong-not-exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interior dread is vividly embodied (hollow vessel, mirror recoil), but the whispering advisor functions as disembodied oracle rather than relationship crucible; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only received wisdom. The final renunciation (dropping the clasp) is symbolically legible yet feels lightly earned because the mirror-test is passed on the first attempt without visible cost beyond startle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward’s embodied listening and tactile micro-choices (“soles of his feet… salt in his veins”) give a vivid interior, but the arc is pure ascent—no contradictory impulse or error under pressure—so the “earned” quality feels thin; the laugh at the climax is the only visible cost, not quite scaled to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s curiosity and defiance are vivid early, but the interior contradiction—why she keeps digging after the hollowed expedition warns her—never crystallizes in-scene; the final sprint to the ship reads as adrenaline rather than earned renunciation. Embodied emotion is strong (“lungs burning”), yet the micro-choice to flee is not shown colliding with an alternative want, so the cost feels generic. The flaw is sufficient for this length, but not yet indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voss’s “archivist of last resort” self-image and the scribe’s parallel dilemma give him a clean internal contradiction; the moment he sees Liora, his stance visibly tilts from theft to preservation, paying the cost of public exposure. Emotion stays embodied—spectacles fog, letter warm in palm—avoiding label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: protect narrative of village vs. protect archival purity. The shift is credible, but the prior stakes (reputation, legal risk) are asserted more than dramatized, so the cost feels moderate rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic detachment vs. empathic inscription—are dramatized in each micro-choice of kneeling, dipping, writing. The final renunciation (“love…lets us let go”) is earned by the chain of found notes that progressively tighten his emotional cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only minor: we never see a genuine mistake that would deepen flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s calm indexer persona is vivid, but interiority stays safe—no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The instant recognition of “Veyne” lands as convenient knowledge rather than destabilizing identity. Micro-choices (kneel, close ledger, smile) are present yet cost-free; the ending stance feels pre-decided. Earned stasis is asserted, not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Veyra’s grief for her brother is embodied in the origami cranes and soot-stained fingers; the moment she palms the basilica floor and chooses a dream is a clear micro-choice that advances her obsession. The final possession-by-dream is credible because her need to externalize sorrow has been shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the cost (loss of bodily autonomy) is visible on the page. The only minor drag: we never see her doubt or hesitate once the lanterns begin to feed, so the flaw feels half-acknowledged rather than actively struggled against.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s grief is viscerally embodied in the charred-lace dress and the geode’s burn; her contradictory impulse—to hunt yet to “show me” the ghost—creates live interior tension. The final micro-choice, clutching the searing geode and running back toward the fire, crystallizes an Earned Stasis that costs her flesh and forecloses safety. Interiority stays concrete, but the scientist-ghost’s flicker is observed more than interacted with, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Still, the hunt motive escalates credibly and the flaw (hunger for awakening) drives the mistake that ends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s choice to follow the call is credible, but his interiority is generic (“like a thread tugging at his chest”). The pilgrim remains a luminous cipher; her perpetual surprise never complicates or costs her anything, so the relationship crucible is empty. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the final yes feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is viscerally embodied; the broken watch and snapped hour-hand are tactile micro-choices that externalize self-loathing. Interior contradiction peaks when he both craves and dreads the truth, yet the uncle’s arrival supplies knowledge rather than forcing Elias to mine it, so the final cost feels half-earned. Still, the renunciation of 3:17 lands with credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory pull between renunciation and duty is embodied in the pocketed drawer-pull; the final step-back is earned because every beat has shown him weighing the talisman against the cost of continued tethering. Seris’s “thoughtful” trait surfaces once—correcting Elias’s “clever” to “thoughtful”—but the beat is too thin to feel like a crucible; still, the single gesture hints at a status shift that justifies the quiet détente. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the micro-choice to pocket both relics crystallizes the film’s central contradiction without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—longing for paternal approval vs. the need to jettison it—are rendered in concrete micro-choices (pocketing, then hurling the compass). The final renunciation is earned, but interiority occasionally drifts into packaged epiphany (“for the first time…”) that blurs embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for a reason to keep going while denying he seeks redemption—surface early and tighten at the mirror chamber. The baseball’s warming against his skin dramatizes the moment empathy tries to re-enter; the final refusal to “find himself” yet still look is a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, but the backstory paragraphs remain summary-level, blunting the embodied cost needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—trembling hands, the paste burning her palm—and her paradoxical steadiness cracks under this one summons, giving us contradiction in scene. The final choice to accept the bird-form is earned because every beat of preparation (gathering spices, pressing the fortune to her pocket) shows the cost of letting go. What keeps the score sub-9 is that the bond itself is asserted more than dramatized; we get no prior shared memory between them, so the depth of love is inferred rather than felt as loss.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—seeking lost time while confessing ink—grounds her; the final palm-to-cloth micro-choice binds past and present with visible ink cost. Yet the absence of on-page opposition or relationship pressure keeps the arc more monologue than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s pacifism is stated, not embodied; she never confronts an active choice that would test mercy, so the trait stays ornamental. The interiority is lyrically voiced but generic—no contradictory impulses play out in real time. Her final “smile” is unearned because the cost of becoming the wound is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the micro-choice to empty the locket does foreclose her path, giving a thin but visible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “quiet rebellion” and barefoot poverty are vivid, but the prophecy beat turns him from agent to pawn; the interior contradiction between giver and chosen savior is asserted, not dramatized under pressure. The mirror vision hands him future action rather than forcing a present micro-choice that costs him something already valued. Still, his body-on-the-line past and the extinguished bug create enough embodied cost to keep the arc legible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s lock-sentinel expertise is shown through tactile micro-choices (hairpin pry, silent footfall) and a single interior contradiction—years of guarding locks now weaponized against the fort—giving her a credible, embodied arc. The aide’s brief appearance still registers status tension and triggers her decisive theft. Cost is visible: she forfeits her sentinel identity the instant she palms the parchment. Competence is high yet balanced by the blackout’s real risk; no diagnostic self-talk mars the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s precognitive curse and eel-herding vocation give him a singular interior signature; the moment he kneels and feels “the hum of something older” embodies his lifetime of pattern-reading. The final micro-choice—placing the last rock while eels coil around his wrists—crystallizes a hierarchy of values (promise > fear) with tactile cost. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the beat where “the promise became clear” leans summary rather than simultaneous contradiction, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile engagement with railing and timer, the laugh swallowed by storm—but the photograph never tests him in a visible choice; he only “waits” and then “turns away,” so the cost is atmospheric rather than embodied. The contradictory impulse (to read vs. to carry unread) is named late but not dramatized under pressure, keeping the arc just short of earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s mechanical arm and “diplomatically fierce” tag stay ornamental; only the needle-card micro-choice shows hierarchy of values. Isolde’s shift from smirk to surrender is sketched, not embodied. Interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory. Closure choice is credible but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lumen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to belong yet denying identity—surface only in summary; the moment he hands Neruda to Elias is the first embodied choice that costs him his “vagrant” mask, but the monthly molting trait never constrains action on-page, keeping the arc one beat short of full earn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in the salt mist on his fingers and the daily winding of a dead clock; the contradictory impulse to freeze time yet force a storm is kept alive through tactile ritual. The final choice—the chaotic encore—grows credibly from the film-reel “loophole” and the seventeen-year habit of turning pain into music, so the renunciation of safe repetition carries visible cost when the clock starts again.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her fear of planting the seed is embodied in clenched fists and breath-hitches, not labels. The contradictory impulses (protect vs. reveal) coexist in the same beats, and her final choice to plant and then to “tell them” feels earned because the dream literally grafts the woman’s warning onto her body. Cost is visible: the vine cuffing her wrist signals she is now bound to the archive. Only minor slip: Nani functions more as oracle than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s slow-spoken trait is shown through measured gestures and the trembling hand on the maple, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final “mend” is asserted rather than forced by a visible choice with cost. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“color of unspoken apologies”) instead of embodied contradiction. The compass/lace act as externalized will, so agency feels symbolic, not pressured.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her scientific lens filters perception without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choice to sketch the dust patterns reveals a hierarchy of values: observation over intervention, humility over control. The renunciation of cosmic drama for quiet decay feels earned by her tactile engagement with residue and ruin. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitude intensifies the stakes of attention itself.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and particular—her glass artistry, scars, and tactile relationship with the ledger all reveal character under pressure. Her contradiction between adaptive resilience and the need for answers feels lived-in, not summarized. Jaren’s guilt-fear duality adds relational tension without over-explaining. Final choice to keep the ledger earns cost through prior causality: she trades safety for knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—translating silence into music—is rooted in trauma and embodied through tactile interaction with the tuning fork and heat-mapping device. His internal contradiction (longing for sound vs. enduring silence) manifests in micro-choices like striking the fork against glass, not just summarized emotion. Liora functions as pressure, not prop, her amber-emotion steadiness contrasting his violet-indigo turmoil. The final “language of silence” feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost visible in his trembling hands and fractured hearing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The undertaker’s inadvertently stubborn nature drives his return to the drowned library, and his emotional arc—from trembling hesitation to earned stillness—is embodied through tactile choices (packing the satchel, placing the lens) rather than exposition. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; fear and duty coexist in physical details like “legs heavy with the weight of what he was about to do.” The final renunciation of isolation—choosing to read aloud to the dead—feels earned by prior causality. However, the backstory of his first visit slightly flattens present tension without altering immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is embodied and consistent—her touch on the tiles, her muted handling of the bell, her quiet refusals—all reveal a leader shaped by exile, memory, and care. Her contradictions (strength vs. vulnerability, hope vs. realism) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to withhold ringing the second bell is earned through prior restraint and deepens her role as keeper of intergenerational continuity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lien’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, breath curling in fog—and her contradiction (carrying love with “nowhere to go”) fuels the climax. The father’s appearance crystallizes her motivation without over-explaining. Her final act feels earned by prior causality: the memory, the tear’s discovery, and her understanding of “pilgrim of sparks.” No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, obsession with time, and tactile relationship to memory feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (pressing the fragment to the photo, stepping through the willow) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, closure over preservation. The final renunciation—accepting irreversible personal cost to restore lost moments—is earned by her lifelong entanglement with the garden’s temporal logic. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s raw wrists, embodied dread of clinking chains, and micro-choices (e.g., understanding the keys’ musical logic) reveal a coherent interiority under pressure. Vey’s strategic silence and status shift during the scavenger encounter feel earned, not archetypal. The final renunciation—taking “not too much”—emerges from prior causality with visible cost: resilience as planting, not hoarding. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain tactile and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief, betrayal, and terminal illness—is consistent and intensifies organically. His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. inherited obsession) manifests through embodied choices: handling brittle notes, feeding foil into the forge, recalling his wife’s lie. The final act of imprinting silence reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over comfort—with visible cost in his acceptance of partial answers. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile memory and synesthetic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, hitched breath, and luminous disbelief feel specific and grounded. Her motivation (to “press her ear against destiny’s door”) evolves credibly into collaborative creation rather than theft. Kael’s “quietly savvy” demeanor is shown through precise action (flower arranging, offering the rose), not label-speak. The final choice—to stay—feels earned by their mutual recognition of shared values, with the cost being the missed train and old solitary identity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his glassblowing past, the bookmark, his mother’s warning—all anchor his emotional state without diagnostic label-speak. His contradictory impulses (desire for solitude vs. need for connection) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when he abandons the journal yet returns to craft. The final choice to “shape something new” feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the unfinished orb and abandoned studio. Minor deduction: the shift from paralysis to action hinges on metaphor rather than a decisive external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her phobia “gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat,” and her adaptive resilience manifests in concrete choices (lunging forward, prying the floorboard). The caretaker’s presence forces relational stakes that crystallize in mutual recognition, not exposition. However, the final emotional shift (“vulnerability wasn’t weakness”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient micro-behavior to ground it mid-crisis. Still, her trembling hands and tactical use of the cast demonstrate consistent, character-specific contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle’s interiority is richly embodied—her obsession with pebbles, tactile reverence for the booklet, and silent epiphany feel character-specific, not archetypal. Her motivation crystallizes organically from lifelong silence into active map-making through breath and pause. The final renunciation of speech is earned by prior causality: she sought not answers but shape for silence, and the cost—shedding the physical artifact—is felt in her lightened body. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (obsession vs. release) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    E-7X’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—his glitches, yearning for origin, and tactile engagement with the violin avoid diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (hovering, pressing palm, plucking) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over function. The “stitched-shut” reflection introduces haunting self-doubt without over-explaining. Final renunciation (“didn’t have an answer—but he had a direction”) earns Stasis through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira and Elias exhibit layered interiority—Mira’s guarded observation, Elias’s anxious surveillance—both rooted in consistent traits that drive their micro-choices (pocketing the stub, withholding the lens). Their contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. fear of betrayal) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final exchange (“Maybe not at first… Now I think we’re both tired of pretending”) earns its emotional shift through prior tension, with visible relational cost. Voice distinction in dialogue is subtle but credible, avoiding convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—his lifelong pretense of indifference versus his desperate need for the garden’s acknowledgment—is rendered through embodied micro-choices: polishing marbles, clipping the blood-red rose, kneeling despite popping knees. His self-deception (“mended deception”) isn’t stated but enacted, and his final renunciation of control (“only to tend”) emerges credibly from prior behavior. The flaw is not safety-hedged; his vulnerability is specific, tactile, and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her obsession with lateral time stems from observed anomalies and xenobiological evidence. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers moving with practiced precision,” “heart pounded”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice—overriding safety protocols to pull the lever—is earned by prior causality, and the cost (existential weight, AI confrontation, irreversible station change) is felt. Minor deduction: internal contradiction is implied but not dramatized in-scene as simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s motivation—unraveling Elias’s mystery—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (adjusting her case, wading into water, handling the program). Her internal conflict is shown via sensory immersion rather than exposition, and her final choice to play the violin feels earned by prior curiosity and courage. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible contradiction or hesitation that would deepen interiority; she moves from intrigue to resolution with minimal friction. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but this aligns with Track A defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling finger, fever residue, and guilt over the false landslide prediction feel specific and lived-in. His contradiction (fearing error yet finding freedom in uncertainty) drives micro-choices like smudging the ink and descending the mountain. The final renunciation of prophetic burden is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; his transformation arises from tactile discovery, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s recklessness and skepticism are embodied through micro-choices (stepping over the fence, ignoring warnings) and culminate in his offering of the valve wheel—a renunciation that feels earned. His internal conflict between rationality and dread manifests physically (“hair on his arms prickled,” “breath hitched”) without diagnostic self-awareness. The faceless figure functions less as a character and more as an extension of Elias’s psyche, limiting relational dynamics but preserving single-POV coherence. Final endurance carries visible cost: he surrenders control, accepting haunting as truth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile perception and quiet contradiction—her desire to witness without judgment clashes subtly with her yearning for meaning, crystallized in the final swan-touch. Her micro-choices (not mapping the library, releasing the book) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in acceptance over control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through gnarled fingers, river-whispers, and folded paper. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his trembling hands, steady guitar-playing, and racing heart reveal layered responses without diagnostic language. Liora’s cautious exuberance contrasts effectively, though her motivation leans slightly on plot convenience. The final choice (accepting kinship) feels earned through prior emotional groundwork, yet the cost of this new bond remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, breath held over fragile paper—and her motivation evolves from passive collector to active listener. Her final choice to reach toward the tapestry feels earned by prior micro-choices (tracing spines, pressing palms to concrete). The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises through tactile perception. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in paternal legacy and cryptic inheritance—is consistent, embodied, and deepens under pressure. His micro-choices (searching the bent light, heating water for the microdot) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by childhood exposure to spycraft. The final decision to “play it” feels earned through prior causality and carries the cost of stepping into his father’s shadow. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains filtered through sensory, concrete detail (“salt on the island’s rocks,” “grease like a fortune cookie”).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Father Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fear, ritualistic discipline, and epistemic hunger manifest through concrete micro-choices (smearing violet, activating the pedal). His motivation to “illuminate hidden assumptions” drives every action and culminates in a credible endurance: accepting possession as revelation rather than resisting it. The final image of violet spreading across his body externalizes internal transformation without diagnostic self-awareness. His flaws (silence as avoidance) directly shape the cost: he risks dissolution to gain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath fogging glass, the shell’s warmth—and her contradictions (yearning for agency vs. paralysis) pulse through micro-choices like pressing the shell to her ear. Motivation stems organically from “chronological homesickness,” not exposition. The final renunciation (listening to silence as conducting) feels earned by memory-mapping as rebellion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and precise metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal fracture is rendered with visceral specificity—his hesitation before the scarred self, clenched fists against spectral regrets—and his final renunciation (“He let go of the door”) earns wholeness through embodied cost. The vision of alternate selves bleeds memory without therapy-speak, and his choice forecloses conquest in favor of integration. Minor deduction: the “monstrous” self remains abstract, slightly flattening the moral spectrum. Still, contradictory impulses (desire to conquer vs. need to accept) act simultaneously in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s emotional numbness and Elias’s deafness are rendered through embodied perception rather than exposition; their contradictory impulses—Mira’s urge to flee silence versus her need to feel, Elias’s quiet certainty versus his relic-hoarding doubt—are dramatized in micro-choices (e.g., Mira reaching for the needle, Elias placing it on the drum). The final beat of acceptance is earned through tactile escalation, not epiphany, and carries visible cost: she must stop running from emptiness. Their relationship functions as crucible without dialogue, using signed language and physical resonance to force a stance shift that forecloses old coping mechanisms.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meticulousness, curiosity, and solitude shape his perception and choices. His emotional state is embodied (“prickle at the nape,” “pulse steady despite unease”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final decision to act emerges credibly from his traits, though the shift from observer to actor lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs him something on the page, slightly weakening motivation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, flinching at citrus, clutching the vial—all reveal a grief that contradicts his profession as a lantern broker who trades in light yet seeks darkness. His final micro-choice to keep the vial as a reminder, not a relic, shows credible endurance with felt cost. The woman functions effectively as a catalyst without overreaching; her dialogue carries thematic weight without stealing agency. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and emotional progression feels layered, irrational, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirien’s motivation—to feel time’s texture—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her toward the rope as both key and risk. Her “ethically playful” trait manifests in her grin and willingness to test limits, not just as label but as lived stance under pressure. The internal conflict between curiosity and consequence is rendered through tactile perception (“fingers trembled,” “breath shallow”) rather than diagnostic abstraction. However, the final epiphany—“time was alive”—edges close to unearned lyricism, though it’s partially grounded by the vision of the past prisoner.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is consistent, embodied through her playing and use of the bowl, and tied to generational trauma. Her internal conflict (grief vs. artistic duty) simmers without melodrama, and her micro-choices (dipping the bowl, improvising) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive turn or cost that forecloses a path; she endures rather than transforms, which fits Earned Stasis but doesn’t deepen beyond atmospheric resonance. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV interiority remains vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her detachment as armor, her dangerous empathy—and her micro-choices (pressing the petal, stepping back) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Darian’s quiet presence functions effectively as crucible without over-exposition. The only restraint from 9+ is that Liora’s motivation (“care too much”) edges toward diagnostic phrasing rather than fully dramatized contradiction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “whimsically attentive” nature manifests in tactile observation (tracing ledger spines, noting dockworkers) and micro-choices (hesitating before opening the envelope). Mara’s restrained reaction to the locket photo reveals history without exposition. Their brief exchange carries subtext and status nuance: Elias offers agency, Mara claims it. The final decision—to launch a fund—is earned by prior characterization, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her reed sculptures, breath like “whispers of lost languages,” and hesitation before stepping forward reveal a lifetime of exclusion without therapy-speak. Her final choice to place the sculpture against the arbor feels earned by her yearning and prior isolation. The travelers’ minimal but precise pressure (the scarred woman’s palm, their shared search) forces a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values: belonging over solitude. No diagnostic labels; emotion arises through tactile action and specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motivation—finding the source of echoes to sculpt time—is consistent and embodied through her actions and sensory engagement. Her internal conflict is implied but not dramatized as contradictory impulses; she moves with near-unbroken resolve. The infinity pendant functions as both talisman and tool, grounding her emotional stakes in physical sensation. However, her illustrative profession informs observation more than decisive choice, limiting character-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally precise—his grief, curiosity, and restraint are embodied in tactile gestures (brushing bark, tracing cracks) rather than abstract labels. His motivation—understanding emotion through the orchard’s silence—arises organically from his sister’s disappearance, and his final micro-choice (accepting presence over recovery) forecloses closure yet carries palpable cost. The glass eyes function as both emotional conduit and symbolic anchor without veering into therapy-speak. His gently inventive method reveals a hierarchy of values: knowledge over possession, connection over resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in the sense-memory flashback and his hesitation before revealing himself. His “kindly methodical” nature informs micro-choices (e.g., using a stolen butter knife) and creates tension between caution and longing. However, the final choice—remaining hidden—is credible but lacks a decisive internal turn; it reads more as continuation than reconfiguration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tension between control and surrender manifests in micro-choices (e.g., hesitating before touching the sapling, then kneeling in mud). Her motivation to study transformation is credible and deepened by her grandmother’s texts. However, the shift from observer to surrenderer lacks a fully dramatized internal struggle; the epiphany feels slightly swift given her established identity as a cultivator who “pruned into submission.” Still, her final renunciation of control carries emotional weight and aligns with her history.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia, tactile obsession with paint, and conflicted drive to remember/forget are embodied with visceral specificity. His final choice—to take the woman’s hand—feels earned by his prior renunciations (refusing offerings, scraping canvases). The woman’s wry earnestness is shown through action (“You’re late”) and stained fingers, not labels. Both characters read as individuals shaped by trauma, not archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet clairvoyance feels specific and embodied, especially in his noticing of “mundane magic.” His final realization—“he hadn’t understood its price”—is earned through his passive observation escalating into helpless witnessing. The pilgrim’s motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped; her abrupt disappearance and return lack micro-choices that would deepen their dynamic. Still, Elias’s flawed perception (“his gift had failed him”) credibly drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as an archivist seeking to restore erased history. Her “reactively visionary” trait informs her perception of the valves as keys, not curiosities. Interiority is concrete—damp parchment against ribs, salt on lips—and her trembling fingers at the climax embody emotional weight. Dain serves as effective secondary pressure, though his character remains functional rather than deeply developed.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation as a mapper of hidden paths is consistent and embodied through tactile observation and micro-choices (e.g., tracing cracks, pressing ear to manhole). His final decision feels earned, though internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized under pressure. The woman’s presence introduces relationship pressure but remains archetypal rather than fully reciprocal. Flaws are present but not deeply tested beyond professional obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus yearning—is embodied through tactile choices (brushing dust, pressing palm, transcribing) rather than abstract reflection. His micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling despite doubt, pulling out the notebook) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he sacrifices certainty for connection. The final act of transcription isn’t epiphany but earned endurance, foreclosing his former detachment. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s motivation—discovering “what happens after goodbye”—is profoundly rooted in her immortality and consistently drives her choices. Her internal conflict between scholarly caution and existential yearning manifests physically (gripping the amulet, channeling energy) and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses Kael’s path while accepting silence as answer. Kael functions effectively as pressure, not caricature, with distinct voice and aligned motive. The final endurance (“not afraid of it”) is earned through prior restraint and sacrifice, though the cost could be more viscerally rendered beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and morally textured—his tension between inherited cynicism and ethical curiosity feels lived-in. The woman’s desperation is embodied in bruises and a split lip, not exposition. Their micro-choices (Elias withholding then offering the pot; her hesitation) reveal hierarchies of value with immediate cost. However, the final decision lacks a fully dramatized internal struggle—it leans slightly on implication over on-page contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stationer’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, heartbeat-synced hum—and his motivation to “collect textures of different times” feels consistent and psychologically grounded. His micro-choice to write the final line despite uncertainty reveals a hierarchy of values: legacy over solitude. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see longing, not active struggle between opposing desires in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in the death certificate error and the poison label—is consistent and deepened by embodied gestures (handling the label, crouching in mudflats). His internal conflict between searching for truth and accepting erasure culminates credibly in Earned Stasis. The encounter with the woman adds relational pressure without over-explaining; her cryptic presence sharpens his choice. However, his emotional arc leans slightly on summary (“he had learned to filter reality differently”) rather than dramatized contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s skepticism and emotional transformation feel earned through concrete sensory engagement rather than abstract epiphany. His micro-choices—pressing the shell to his ear, plucking the cello string—reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from doubt to wonder. The fisherman’s earnestness and the astronomer’s frustration are vivid but never over-explained. However, Elias’s internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; his shift feels sequential rather than conflicted in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lan’s interior contradiction—between loyalty to the carnival and utility to outsiders—is embodied in micro-choices (slipping notes, spicing food) and crystallizes in her final stance. Her “orderly intuitive” trait manifests through pattern recognition that drives action, not just observation. However, Old Man Vey’s late appearance risks reducing their relationship to symbolic function; his dialogue (“The raft survives because we choose it”) borders on thematic echo but is salvaged by tactile staging (hand on shoulder) and Lan’s earned belief. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile engagement with regolith, the sand grain, cobalt chloride—all embody his quiet reverence. His motivation (“to witness its quiet surrender”) intensifies through micro-choices (photographing, chemical message) that carry visible cost: accepting impermanence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action, not summary. Final renunciation—leaving the crater to be destroyed—is earned by prior causality and charged with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that shapes his perception, choices, and expertise—his tactile repair work, reliance on sound and refraction, and quiet confidence feel earned. Mara functions as both pressure and witness, her brief dialogue revealing relational history without exposition. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of sight itself: he trusts what he cannot see, a stance crystallized through micro-choices (testing water, releasing the drone). No diagnostic self-awareness; emotion is embodied in fingers stilled, breath held, hands pressed to metal.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s dry wit, embodied through precise occupational detail (“corrected borders with the same precision others used to stir tea”), grounds her motivation in character rather than plot convenience. Her internal contradiction—seeking order in maps while drawn to frayed edges—is rendered through tactile choices (tracing condensation, clutching the phrasebook) rather than exposition. The keeper’s minimal presence sharpens her solitude without diluting focus. Final decision feels earned: confidence emerges from pattern recognition, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tuner’s motivation—restoring resonance, not rebuilding physically—is consistent and embodied through precise actions (e.g., matching phantom footsteps). His “infinitely patient” trait manifests as tactical restraint, avoiding forced rhythms that might shatter echoes. Interiority remains concrete (“fingers stained with patina,” “breath steady”), avoiding diagnostic labels. Final renunciation—leaving without looking back—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: he forgoes witnessing the town’s restored listening.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—answering a distress call tied to her mother’s legacy—is clear and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“loneliness gnawed at her ribs like a starving thing”) and embodied, with micro-choices (uncorking the vial) revealing hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—offering memory instead of fighting—feels earned by prior causality. However, the diver’s role as catalyst lacks reciprocal development, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—threading truth from his father’s lies—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions (the lattice, the ledger). His internal conflict between inherited silence and the need to speak is dramatized in micro-choices (stepping back, then speaking his name). The final act feels earned: naming himself breaks the hush, aligning with his arc from passive inheritor to active truth-teller. However, the father’s influence remains abstract, slightly weakening the emotional specificity of Elias’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, hitched breath, and frayed memory feel visceral, not diagnostic. The ghost bride functions as a crucible: their ambiguous past (sister? lover?) forces Liora into a final reckoning that forecloses denial with palpable cost. Her micro-choice to close her fingers around the bead crystallizes decades of evasion into acceptance. The only slight flaw: the “lifetimes running” line risks abstraction but is quickly grounded by the blood-stained flashback.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation (“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”) is consistent and embodied through tactile actions—tracing grooves, clutching the plate, sewing with memory. Her internal conflict between doubt and creative faith manifests in micro-choices (e.g., tucking the needle into her belt despite trembling). The final act of sewing at the loom feels earned by prior emotional buildup. However, the unseen walker remains underdeveloped as a psychological or metaphysical counterpoint, slightly weakening the interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—restoring buried faith—is rooted in consistent, embodied behavior (digging, tracing roots, placing the relic) and deepens through physical struggle. His internal contradiction (doubt vs. conviction) manifests not as alternating summaries but through tactile persistence amid exhaustion. The final recognition—not worship but kinship with the radiant figure—feels earned by his labor, not declared. However, the “warmly curious hum” borders on label-speak without sufficient bodily grounding to fully satisfy the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile relationship with the clipboard, his obsession with surface mail, and his emotional restraint all feel lived-in. His final realization (“searching for his own [name] all along”) emerges credibly from his history of crafting identities for others. The mother’s appearance is earned through prior clues, and their reunion carries quiet emotional weight without overstatement. However, the internal contradiction between self-erasure and self-discovery could be more viscerally dramatized in micro-choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a listener and embroiderer, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath catching) that avoids diagnostic labels. Her final act—disguising herself and disseminating truth through fabric—is earned by prior choices and carries visible social risk. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; she shifts from fear to action without dramatized struggle, slightly flattening the emotional arc. The lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but interiority compensates well within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret, fear, and longing manifest through tactile details (the shard, the letter, condensation) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (wiping away messages, pressing the shard to her scar) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The apparition scene avoids sentimentality by grounding emotional confrontation in sensory specificity (“voice like the rustle of leaves,” “trail of cool moisture”). Final renunciation—accepting the unsent letter as a beginning—is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her pain, disorientation, and empathy are rendered through tactile detail (“plaster cast rough against her skin,” “anesthetic hummed in her veins”). Her motivation—to return despite evacuation—feels urgent and personal, rooted in her history as a translator of suffering. The boy’s mirroring cast creates credible relational pressure that crystallizes her choice to connect rather than withdraw. However, the final renunciation lacks a tangible cost beyond emotional resonance; the story implies transformation but doesn’t show what path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation—rediscovering lost joy through light—is embodied in precise, tactile choices (adjusting exposure, pinning the print) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction (longing vs. artistic restraint) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final micro-choice—to display the print—earns emotional closure with visible cost: years of weight lifted like fog. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through perception (“breath caught,” “fingers trembled”).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “methodically playful” trait drives key choices—questioning grime as veil, testing the trumpet’s function—and culminates in a credible, costly leap into the unknown. His interiority is vividly embodied (“breath fogging the glass,” “note that wasn’t there”), and his emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice feels earned by prior curiosity, though the story stops just short of showing the cost paid, relying on implication. A hairline slip: the buffalo nickel’s transformation borders on unearned spectacle without deeper character-specific anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between retreat and defiance—is embodied in his stiffening at the inspector’s arrival and his eventual reach for the map. Quill’s charm masks urgency, and their dynamic reveals status shifts: Elias holds institutional legitimacy, Quill the subversive spark. The final choice (“Show me where to start”) feels earned by prior history (his club membership) and present pressure. Minor deduction: Quill’s motivation leans slightly on archetype, though his grin-to-gravity arc compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to “photosynthesize pain into beauty”—is vividly embodied through his insomnia, trembling hands, and failed verses. His internal contradiction (grief vs. creative yearning) manifests in concrete sensory detail (“ink still wet with the salt of his tears”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final act of writing feels earned by accumulated pressure, though the transformation lacks a visible trade-off beyond emotional release. His flaw—perfectionism that turns words to ash—is consistent but resolves too cleanly without tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation—preserving forgotten names through glass orchids—is consistent, embodied, and deepened by her decades-long obsession with the bamboo tube. Her internal conflict between duty and longing is rendered through precise actions (whispering names, tending fragile blooms) rather than exposition. The final realization—that she gives names a place to live again—feels earned, not epiphanic, emerging from tactile engagement with her medium. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in the hum of glass and shadow of light.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, fogged breath, and cautious exuberance reveal a scholar torn between reverence and recklessness. Her motivation (restoring trust through linguistic resurrection) intensifies under pressure and culminates in a credible, costly choice: speaking the final promise despite unknown consequences. The “carefully reckless” trait isn’t just stated—it manifests in her micro-choices, like dipping the quill into iridescent ink while aware of ruin’s proximity. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile, sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior conflict—between reverence for the past and responsibility for the present—is embodied with tactile precision (calloused fingers on brass gears, trembling hands) and crystallizes in her micro-choice to “listen” rather than control. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; instead, contradiction lives in her simultaneous fear and resolve. The final renunciation of “taming” is earned through prior struggle with the floodgate mechanism and deepens her relationship to the mountain. No safety-hedging: her flaw (seeing harmony as control) directly shapes the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reinvention as a pigeon trainer, his trembling hands upon seeing the lyric sheet, and his final choice to stay all reveal layered interiority grounded in loss and hope. His contradiction—fleeing scholarly failure while compulsively mapping dust motes—feels authentic and embodied. Lena’s sharp angles and soft eyes function as both crucible and catalyst without veering into archetype. The meteorite chip and ledger serve as tangible anchors for his emotional stakes, making his renunciation of flight credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile fixation on wood grain, the weight of the logbook, the prism’s coolness—all reveal a man whose love manifests as forensic attention. His flaw (over-analysis as emotional proxy) directly enables his final realization: that some thresholds cannot be crossed twice. The “featherly determined” trait attributed to Mira retroactively explains her disappearance without reducing her to a symbol. The only limitation is that Mira remains off-page, constraining relational dynamics to memory—but this serves the story’s accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—seeking the “rhythm of belonging”—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the feather, murals, and bioluminescence. His final hesitation at the closing passage shows credible endurance with visible cost: choosing surface life over belonging. Liora functions effectively as a pressure source, though her interiority remains thin. The trait “softly ingenious” is shown in his decoding of murals and logs, not merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with the crater glass and seed conveys emotional weight without diagnostic labels. Her central conflict (seeking missing paths vs. accepting loss) manifests in micro-choices: kneeling, hesitating, turning back. The final renunciation (“Some pieces were meant to stay missing”) feels earned through accumulated sensory experience, not epiphany. However, her backstory as “sea-foam recollectionist” remains evocative but under-motivated—its mechanics don’t visibly constrain her actions beyond poetic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her analytical mind refracting performance, fatigue, and longing through tactile observation (“orchestrated serendipity”) rather than exposition. Her micro-choices (tossing the bishop, initiating dance) reveal a hierarchy of values: creation over repetition, risk over safety. The violinist’s presence tests but doesn’t resolve her solitude, deepening her agency without diluting focus. Flawed yet competent, she avoids epiphanic neatness; her shift feels earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—refusing to dance for a world that forgot the tides—is consistent, embodied, and deepened by her tactile connection to the moonstone and the garden. Her final choice to ink the sea onto the stranger’s skin emerges organically from her internal conflict between exile and expression. The man’s shifting constellations and poetic goal provide immediate, credible pressure without overshadowing her agency. Minor deduction: the “drowned gods” detail risks slight overreach in emotional calibration during a high-stakes act.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile perception and professional habit, grounding his epiphany in lived detail rather than abstraction. His micro-choice to enter the atrium feels earned by prior restlessness and dream logic. The old woman functions effectively as a pressure catalyst without over-explaining. However, his final realization (“the light had always been there”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak without fully embodying the cost of that insight in action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias and the stranger are rendered with precise, embodied interiority—scars, voice loss, and grief manifest physically and psychologically without diagnostic labels. Their contradictory impulses (Elias’s return to trauma, the stranger’s hesitation before writing) feel authentic and pressure-tested. The final micro-choice—to write, to listen—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Both characters avoid archetype through specific sensory detail and restrained vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her “logical dreamer” lens, with embodied perception (e.g., feeling the gauge’s vibration “in the marrow of her bones”) and micro-choices (arranging shells as trial balloons). Her motivation—to find equations for hope—is consistent and intensifies credibly. However, the final realization (“the gauge was a bridge”) borders on unearned epiphany; it lacks a concrete prior action that forces this insight, leaning slightly into diagnostic label-speak (“proof that hope wasn’t just a fleeting emotion but a force”). The cost of her endurance—fading hope—is felt but not viscerally dramatized in a decisive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“static before a storm,” “feverish” stone) and micro-choices (kneeling, flipping diaries). His motivation—deciphering his father’s obsession—is consistent and deepens under pressure. The final confrontation reveals credible endurance rather than tidy resolution, with legacy as burden made visceral. However, the woman’s sudden appearance lacks relational buildup, slightly flattening the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with the prism, the hum of lullabies beneath her breath, and the borrowed heartbeat thrumming “beneath her ribs” reveal a character shaped by inherited mystery and quiet desperation. Her motivation—to paint not what she sees but what she feels—is consistent and intensifies as the mirage sharpens. The watchman serves as a subtle pressure without overburdening the frame, and their dialogue reveals status through restraint, not exposition. Her final belief in the mirage reads as earned endurance, not epiphany, with the cost being her solitude and the weight of being “the last who remembered.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling clipboard, exhaustion, and moral fatigue feel specific and unforced. Kessar’s shift from adversary to penitent is credible due to restrained staging and subtextual dialogue. Their contradictory impulses (Liora’s hope vs. cynicism, Kessar’s pride vs. remorse) operate simultaneously in scene. However, the final renunciation lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path; the resolution leans on mutual assent rather than individual sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—amoral pragmatism versus secret sentimentality—operate simultaneously in scene, most powerfully in his decision to end the drought while leaving the egg behind. His micro-choices (e.g., brushing salt from his knees after releasing the rivers) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he sacrifices his pristine reputation and control over the land to preserve an intangible echo. The locked drawer backstory is concretely anchored to present action via the egg and earns emotional weight without therapy-speak. His flaws drive the central moral calculus, and the renunciation feels inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with concrete contradictions—her vow as both burden and armor, her silence as shield yet source of yearning. Her micro-choices (tracing threads, pressing palm to black thread) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the final epiphany (“conformity was not a song, but a silence”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of the cognitive shift in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation—ethical storytelling as performance—is vividly embodied through her puppet shows and ritual with the story stick. Her internal conflict with her brother sharpens her resolve without over-explaining, and her “uncommonly serene” composure contrasts believably with the rawness of recent argument. However, her emotional state remains slightly idealized; the absence of tangible doubt or hesitation undercuts full contradiction in-scene. The final renunciation (“The work was just beginning”) feels earned but lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile reverence for ephemera, the blush of stillness, the deliberate looseness of her knot—all reveal a coherent, flawed worldview. Her motivation (to honor overlooked histories) drives micro-choices with visible cost: she builds signals knowing they’ll dissolve, accepts impermanence as ritual. The final renunciation (“they would not return… but that was enough”) is earned through prior causality and carries quiet emotional weight. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (rooted yet transient) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his guilt, silence, and yearning for preservation feel embodied, not abstract. His micro-choices (breathing on the rope, transcribing sound into braid) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over utility, gentleness over force. The contradiction between his technical mastery and emotional paralysis resolves not in redemption but in Earned Stasis—he accepts silence no longer as surrender but as sacred space. Flawed yet coherent, his arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness while making forgiveness tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile engagement with the wafer seal and fissured ceiling conveys a mind attuned to decay and memory. His motivation (“to discover why some paths choose their walkers”) emerges organically from his attraction to liminal spaces, and his final choice—to step into the storm with the key—is earned through prior micro-choices (reconstructing the seal, entering the dream). The woman functions as oracle rather than full character, but her presence pressures Elias toward reconfiguration without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution; his epiphany feels wrested from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nabu-sharru’s frugality, devotion to knowledge, and quiet courage are embodied through specific actions—stealing the tile not for power but proof, kneeling before an empty throne—and his final choice reflects a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His internal contradiction (seeking cosmic order amid chaos) operates in-scene without diagnostic self-awareness. The figure’s presence tests his motive without undermining his agency, and his endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: he foregoes personal salvation for institutional preservation. No safety-hedging; his flaw (hoarding knowledge) directly enables his covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scheming yet pacifist—is embodied in micro-choices (clenching the pin, pressing it into Veyra’s palm) and layered with resentment, pity, and unresolved grief. Her emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; trembling hands belie her steady voice. However, Veyra’s transformation leans slightly on convenience: his amnesia enables catharsis without sufficient struggle, weakening the reciprocity of their crucible. The final renunciation feels earned for Elara but less so for him, softening the relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mirror maker’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “grounded” nature contradicts his nightly ritual, revealing longing beneath practicality. His micro-choices (carrying the lantern, climbing the glass mountain) stem from consistent traits and escalate credibly. The final renunciation of capture in favor of trust feels earned, with cost implied in his lifelong solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“warm and trembling” dream).

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her frayed ribbon, tactile ritual with tools, and restrained grief reveal layered contradiction without diagnostic labels. The girl’s feistiness functions as active pressure, not ornament, forcing Liora to articulate her philosophy mid-act. Their micro-choices (offering the pendant, accepting the peach) crystallize a hierarchy of values around memory and care. Final renunciation—“some promises don’t break”—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The curator’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, the weight against her ribs, the shift from bewilderment to awe—and her micro-choice to *inquire* with her mind (not hands) catalyzes the climax. Her motivation (to solve the shell’s mystery) intensifies credibly through obsession and inherited silence. However, her final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction; the leap from bafflement to full comprehension lacks a visible struggle in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her botanical expertise, grief for her sister, and "carefully resourceful" nature drive micro-choices like using her diary as a breadcrumb trail. The time traveler’s desperation feels embodied, not explained. Their negotiation reveals status shifts and mutual pressure without exposition. However, the sister’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient causal buildup in Elara’s emotional arc, slightly undermining the final choice’s full motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—driven by grief, obsession, and a need for understanding rather than mere rescue. His micro-choices (tracing the ledger, reaching through mirrors) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over reunion. Liora’s brief presence avoids sentimentality; her ambiguity feels earned, not evasive. However, her transformation into a chimera twin lacks sufficient on-page causality to fully ground Elias’s final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s warmly methodical nature is embodied in precise tactile actions (“fingers tracing the edges of history,” “untangling centuries-old fibers”) and drives her key choice to reconfigure the rope despite resistance. Her internal contradiction—skepticism versus fascination with the impossible—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final decision to archive the truth as story (not secret) emerges credibly from her archivist identity and prior micro-choices, foreclosing silence with visible cost: bearing witness to historical erasure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion stays grounded in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ryn’s motivation is clear and consistent—her desire for silence amid chaos drives every choice, culminating in a high-stakes act of preservation. Her interiority is concrete (“breath misting,” “clenched the stone”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—accepting she cannot keep the bloom but can carry its echo—feels earned through prior pressure. Minor deduction: internal contradiction is implied but not dramatized as simultaneous impulses under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—proving coincidences have meaning—is deeply rooted in personal loss and retrocognition, driving every action with emotional and thematic coherence. His internal contradiction (yearning for connection vs. isolation as custodian) manifests in micro-choices: handling the prism carefully, climbing the pavilion despite futility. The final decision to walk toward the beacon feels earned, not impulsive, with clear cost: abandonment of his post, implied finality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile details like “taste of old rain” and “boots crunching on broken glass.”

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile interaction with books, monuments, and fog reveals a self built from archival fragments. Her “preemptive nostalgia” drives credible micro-choices (kneeling, pressing palms, stepping onto the forecourt) that align with her fear of erasure. The final decision to chase shadows feels earned, though the shift from identity-as-construction to identity-as-excavation leans slightly toward epiphany over dramatized struggle. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her identity as a fire-spinner whose craft is tied to memory, not spectacle. Her micro-choices—chanting, unwinding the rag, striking the match—reveal a hierarchy of values (remembrance over hope) with visible cost: the spent rag, the acceptance of ghosts. The shift from “defy hopelessness” to “remember it” feels earned through embodied action, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her observation of the hermit crab, salt lacework, and the cicada’s pulse reveal a mind attuned to micro-patterns. Her avoidance of her brother’s question and return to face it demonstrate credible emotional progression with visible cost: she forfeits immediate escape for unresolved tension. The “warmly observant” trait isn’t just stated—it drives her method and stakes. Final choice feels earned through consistent causality and character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s claustrophobia and longing for space drive every micro-choice with visceral, embodied specificity—her bare feet on vines, clutching the doll, parsing silences. The boy’s brief presence deepens her arc without overshadowing it; their exchange reveals mutual recognition, not exposition. Her final decision to return isn’t stated but enacted through quiet resolve, showing endurance as agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory contradiction (light that hurts yet compels).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and the woman are rendered with concrete interiority—his tactile relationship to silence, her ink-stained fingers and half-finished thoughts—and their micro-choices (her hesitation before writing, his decision to stop poling) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The storm glass functions as both object and emotional barometer without over-explaining. However, the woman’s motivation leans slightly on implication rather than dramatized contradiction, and her transformation, while resonant, lacks a visible cost beyond emotional release—felt but not priced in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s motivation—restoring stewardship in a unraveling world—is consistent and embodied through tactile choices (scraping bark, pressing the flake to earth). Her internal contradiction between scholarly caution and necessary risk crystallizes in the mural-scraping beat. The final sitting is earned by prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: wisdom over power. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through breath, pulse, and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shadow keeper’s internal conflict—between self-imposed exile and latent compassion—is embodied through tactile details (her scar burning, breath catching) rather than abstract reflection. Her final choice to touch the child feels earned by prior causality: her history as a healer, the shared scar, and the sanctuary’s oppressive silence all converge. The child’s presence functions as both mirror and catalyst without reducing either character to archetype. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution, which softens the moral ambiguity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s “virtuously mischievous” nature manifests in concrete hesitation and eventual agency, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses escape but affirms responsibility. His internal contradiction—between regret and redemption—is embodied in tactile responses to the bolt and diamond, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice feels earned because it emerges from his specific history with the pyramid scheme, not abstract morality. Mara’s minimal presence applies pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a personal quest for truth, and his micro-choices (reaching for the handle, stepping onto the bridge) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is concrete—fingers tracing ink, breath hitching—but avoids diagnostic self-awareness. His emotional progression feels credible, layered with urgency and ancestral grief. However, the specter interaction leans slightly toward exposition over embodied contradiction, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s withdrawn silence and internal conflict are embodied with precision—his gauntlets scraping stone, breath hitching, sword trembling—all revealing a man torn between withdrawal and agency. His final renunciation (dropping the sword) is earned by prior causality: years of war trauma, the lure of possibility, and the greenhouse’s destabilizing pressure. The woman functions as catalyst, not crutch; her presence sharpens his choice without overriding it. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains visceral, contradictory, and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in his tactile relationship with archival traces (“dust patterns,” the button). His motivation—to magnify overlooked kindnesses—is credibly rooted in personal loss and drives his actions without sentimentality. The landlady scene reveals micro-choices (asking about Daniel’s whereabouts) that align with his values under quiet pressure. However, his emotional shift at the end leans slightly toward tidy resolution rather than fully contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her underestimation fuels her resourcefulness, and her final act of defiance is earned through prior restraint and hoarded truth. Interiority is concrete (“fingers tightening around the phone booth key,” “stomach twist”) and avoids diagnostic labels. Her choice to stay and broadcast carries visible cost: probable death, yet she smiles, crystallizing her renunciation of invisibility. The only limitation is slight emotional compression in the climax, where more layered contradiction could elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a deeply personal, embodied quest—his grandmother’s hummed melody lodged “in his bones like a splinter”—and his final act of playing the prophecy back feels earned. His internal conflict between duty and exhaustion manifests physically (“lungs burned”) and emotionally through silence-as-action. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and his flaw (obsession) isn’t shown actively complicating choices mid-scene—only as backdrop. Still, his renunciation of noise for silence reads as credible endurance with tangible cost: the saxophone case grows lighter, implying sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motivation—decoding order in chaos—is consistent and embodied through tactile rituals (sorting seeds, building monuments). Her transformation feels earned via the moonstone’s revelation, though the internal contradiction between skepticism and belief remains underexplored. The final act of sorting leaves reflects credible endurance with cost: she abandons human society for arboreal communion, signaled by moss-clad sleeves and villagers’ whispers. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure; change arrives via dream logic rather than active renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal conflict—precision versus uncertainty—is embodied through tactile interactions with the clock and compass, not abstract musing. His micro-choices (descending into the cavern, stepping into the mist) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over safety, ambiguity over control. The final smile earns its emotional weight because it emerges from sustained struggle, not epiphany. However, the tinkerer’s backstory remains slightly under-anchored, limiting full character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation—precision over grief, the weight of names—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., rejecting sentimentality, tracing the coin’s scratches) and crystallizes in her final act of pressing the coin into Elias’s palm. Her internal contradiction (need for truth vs. fear of what it reveals) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. Elias’s clarity—not madness—and his use of her given name reveal a relationship under pressure that alters irreversibly. The final renunciation of blame for redemption is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The collector’s interiority is richly embodied—his patched coat, the crocodile’s tooth, his quiet rebellion against sorrow—all revealing a history of failure and yearning without exposition. His motivation (to find real laughter) intensifies under pressure and directly shapes his choice to sit beside the ghost, leading to a resonant renunciation of his former role. The woman’s agency and specificity avoid stereotype; her broken humming and bright laugh feel earned, not symbolic placeholders. Their micro-choices—her patting the rock, his accepting the note—carry visible emotional cost and reconfigure his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover the mathematics of mercy—is compellingly rooted in trauma and embodied through precise physical reactions and micro-choices (e.g., flexing fingers, bracing against the tree). His internal contradiction between seeking balance and rejecting forgiveness feels authentic, not diagnostic. The final renunciation (“knowing when to stop”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, his transformation borders on epiphanic without sufficient struggle in the present beat—wisdom arrives a touch too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories—is embodied in micro-choices (touching the fragment, tracing the painting) and deepened by childhood echoes that feel earned, not expositional. Her internal contradiction between longing for clarity and accepting elusiveness culminates in the locket-wearing act, a credible renunciation of full retrieval. The alchemist and artist apply subtle pressure without overshadowing her agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“hummed against her skin,” “fingers cramped”).

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her observational skill, emotional restraint, and quiet grief shape every micro-choice. Her decision to press the mainspring against the fracture feels earned by her established relationship with time, ghosts, and loss. The cost is legible in what she carries (weight lifting) and what she accepts (ongoing vigilance). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile detail and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is vividly embodied in his tactile interactions with books, frost, and the singed page. His internal contradiction (perfection as both pursuit and prison) manifests in concrete micro-choices: uncorking the whisper, placing the page in the chamber. The final renunciation of the library feels earned, with visible cost in its dissolution. However, his emotional state remains slightly abstracted in peak moments—e.g., “breath curling like smoke”—lacking deeper physiological specificity under rupture stress.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—reimagining a lost civilization through poetic truth—is rooted in consistent traits and embodied through tactile interactions with the shard. His internal conflict between memory and erasure manifests in concrete micro-choices (covering mirrors, positioning the shard) that reveal hierarchy of values. Liora functions effectively as secondary pressure, though her role remains reactive rather than co-constitutive. The final endurance (“gave them back their voice”) reads as earned renunciation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between honest craftsmanship and self-deception—is embodied through tactile actions (trembling hands, recoiling from memory) and a credible emotional arc. His micro-choice to slot the chip into the box earns his transformation without sentimentality. The father-memory beat risks over-explanation but remains anchored in sensory detail (cold metal, contorted grief). Flawed yet consistent motivation sustains pressure, though the stranger’s role slightly flattens secondary character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief, curiosity, and inherited silence—is rendered through embodied detail (calloused hands, trembling compass) and micro-choices (uncorking the vial at the climax). His internal contradiction between scientific collection and mystical surrender culminates in a Charged Poise that forecloses rational explanation with palpable cost. The grandfather’s spectral return feels earned by psychometric setup and emotional logic, not convenience. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany emerges from tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—scaffolding complexity with simplicity—is dramatized through his driftwood craft and culminates in the bridge, a choice that forecloses his old solitary practice. His “perpetually learning” trait isn’t just stated; it enables his acceptance of the timewoven logic without resistance. Mara functions effectively as catalyst rather than full character, avoiding headcount bloat. Interiority remains concrete (“hands itched,” “pieces fit together in his mind”) without diagnostic over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—her tracing of postcards, hovering fingers at the glass—but her motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The “quietly driven” trait is stated more than enacted under pressure, and her epiphany leans toward unearned lyricism without a tangible trade-off. Still, her specificity as an artist grounds her worldview, and the grandmother’s voice provides a credible emotional anchor. The final brushstroke feels resonant but lacks a visible cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—archiving silenced voices—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her into danger. Her retrocognition feels earned through tactile contact with the diary, not convenient magic. Lila’s introduction adds emotional depth without flattening either woman; their shared grief sharpens the stakes. However, Elara’s final sprint lacks a micro-choice that reveals internal contradiction—she simply runs, missing a chance to show fear versus duty in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rejecting false comfort to forge new possibility—is consistent, embodied in his refusal to leave Hollow’s End and his obsessive focus on the bottle. His internal contradiction (stubbornness vs. hope) manifests concretely in his experiments with memory, not abstraction. The final choice to “let the image go” earns a resonant shift without epiphany, grounded in prior action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“warm to the touch,” “air felt lighter”).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (pomegranate juice staining fingers, breath shaping wax) and micro-choices (angling the phonograph, pressing fruit to horn) that reveal his hierarchy of values. His motivation—to archive emotional patterns—emerges as both professional duty and personal reckoning, intensified by memory and omen. The internal contradiction between scribe-as-recorder and accidental prophet feels earned, not diagnostic. Final renunciation of passive archiving for active listening carries visible cost: stained hands, warm cylinder, irreversible engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation—rooted in generational loss and tactile memory—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., pressing the acorn cap to the hatchling). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through sensory detail (“breath curling,” “fingers brushing the cracked shell”). The final renunciation—carrying weight forward rather than dwelling—is earned by her lifelong role as seed saver. A minor slip: the “vortex inheritance” feels slightly externalized, but her agency in wielding it compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her frayed rope mending, her calibrated listening, her quiet defiance—all revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in lived experience. Her mistake feels inevitable, not contrived, and her endurance carries visible cost. The final renunciation (“she would not stop”) reads as Earned Stasis with emotional and professional stakes legible in every micro-choice. No diagnostic label-speak; her curiosity manifests through action, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—finding strength in vulnerability—is consistent and embodied through his quiet rituals and tactile relationship with the station and lantern glass. His internal contradiction (janitor vs. witness) manifests not as alternating summaries but as layered, simultaneous impulses: cleaning while seeking meaning. The final shift from “janitor” to “witness” is earned by prior micro-choices (polishing unused lenses, pressing palm to metal) that reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion stays grounded in gesture and object.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his silence, perception of ghosts, and refusal to open the box all stem from a coherent trauma. His final choice to open it feels earned, not impulsive, and carries visible emotional cost (“breath catching in his throat”). The ghostly woman’s appearance crystallizes his internal conflict without resolving it neatly; he breaks his covenant but preserves silence, embodying Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak or gestural poverty; his “tranquilly perceptive” trait manifests through embodied observation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his obsession with time’s texture, his tactile engagement with objects, and his quiet desperation feel earned. His final choice to become the new keeper emerges from consistent micro-choices (handling the urn, visiting sales, writing tags) that reveal a hierarchy of values: restoration over escape. The dream woman functions as memory, not character, so secondary-character expectations don’t apply. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in breath, pulse, and dust.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief coiled “around her ribs,” pulse quickening at the feather—and her micro-choices (wading in, writing) stem from a consistent, contradictory desire to both honor and transcend loss. Her epiphany about harmonizing discord avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding insight in tactile experience (feather, water, ink). The final act of writing emerges organically from her poet identity and prior behavior, not imposed wisdom. Cost is felt in the enduring presence of grief alongside hope, not erased but reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in his role as guardian and his terminal diagnosis, compelling credible, high-stakes action. His internal contradiction—accepting death while resisting the orchard’s erasure—is embodied in precise gestures like wrapping copper wire. The fox and badger interactions reveal consistent trust earned through behavior, not exposition. His final renunciation (accepting he won’t see completion) is earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—skepticism warring with compelled belief—is embodied in tactile details (amber pressing like a secret, boots sinking) and crystallizes in his final choice to relinquish the amber. His academic arrogance feels authentic, not caricatured, and his transformation avoids diagnostic self-awareness. Liora applies immediate pressure as both mirror and catalyst, though her function leans slightly toward exposition. The cost—abandoning lifelong intellectual identity—is felt but not over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—fertilizing the idea of return—is rooted in a coherent, idiosyncratic worldview that merges grief, ecology, and memory. His interiority is embodied through tactile details (boots sinking, brittle pods) and micro-choices (scattering seeds, nodding to the heron). The contradiction between futility (“no illusions”) and stubborn hope (“the garden was stubborn”) animates his actions without sentimentality. Final renunciation—accepting the earth’s patience over human urgency—earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—translating distance into closeness—is deeply embodied through his trembling hands, maps of the dead, and the preserved leaf. His internal contradiction (desire to escape ghosts vs. compulsion to find the lost) operates simultaneously in-scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to enter the dark is earned by prior causality: each object and memory tightens the coil toward action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile detail (“hands trembled,” “leaf pulsed”).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile relationship with the compass, the weight of ancestral sketches, and his perception of time as a tapestry feel character-specific. His motivation (“to turn confusion into exploration”) is consistent and crystallizes credibly in the final act of drawing. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see resolve, not struggle. The closure choice is earned, but the cost (isolation, uncertainty) is felt more atmospherically than viscerally in his body or immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirien’s motivation—wonder over greed—is consistently embodied through micro-choices (e.g., trading secrets, not stealing outright) and her amendment of her mentor’s credo. Her internal contradiction (cautious yet drawn to the unknown) operates simultaneously in scene, especially during the guardian exchange. The final choice to accept the lid despite ominous warning feels earned by prior causality. Minor deduction: emotional embodiment occasionally leans on familiar phrasing (“pulse quickening,” “breath shallow”) without deeper idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her blurred identity as crisis actor-turned-survivor manifests in tactile choices (footsteps spelling names, palm on empty chessboard). Her final renunciation (“I will not be a pawn again”) is earned through prior contradictions: performance vs. reality, erasure vs. remembrance. The man’s “benevolently ruthless” trait surfaces only in dialogue, slightly weakening his pressure, but Liora’s arc remains tightly causal with visible cost: she abandons the chessboard, symbolizing her rejection of sacrificial roles.

    Elias’s motivation—“to understand the shape of home”—is compellingly embodied through tactile choices (pressing feather to wrist, tracing map with fingertip) and internal contradiction (trust vs. distrust of visions). His flaw—reality-substituting dreams—drives every action without safety-hedging. The final renunciation (“home wasn’t a place to return to, but a shape to carve”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, his emotional progression lacks layered irrationality; the arc leans slightly tidy in its epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his fidgeting, guilt, and fixation on Liora feel embodied and specific, not diagnostic. His micro-choices (decoding threads, touching the tapestry) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over peace, memory over oblivion. The climax forces him to confront his desire to rewrite the past, and his renunciation of that fantasy feels earned. Liora’s spectral appearance avoids sentimentality by embodying shared regret rather than absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s defiance, grief, and artistic compulsion fuse into a coherent interiority with embodied contradictions—e.g., her trembling hands versus sharp declarations. Her micro-choices (touching the spire, speaking poetry) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over obedience, voice over silence. Echo functions as both foil and catalyst without flattening into archetype. The final shift from “not ready” to “alive” feels earned through escalating poetic acts that cost her emotional armor.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars, breath, trembling hands—and his contradictory impulses (desire to mend vs. fear of dissolution) act simultaneously in scene. His final choice to narrate through scars feels earned by prior causality and carries the cost of confronting repressed trauma. However, the mentor’s influence remains abstract; more concrete micro-choices tied to that relationship would elevate motivation beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt in his beard, regret in his bones—and his contradictory impulses (desire to reclaim vs. acceptance of loss) act simultaneously in the final scene. His micro-choice to paint the space between sea and cave, rather than the shell itself, reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he surrenders possession for reconciliation. The flaw lies in slightly over-articulated self-awareness (“acknowledge that some things were never meant to be reclaimed”) that edges toward diagnostic phrasing without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to prove whispers travel farther than shouts—is embodied in micro-choices (blowing into the cork, releasing the vial) that reveal a hierarchy of values: belief over proof, resonance over noise. His interiority is concrete (“vibrations of intent,” “garden he’d never seen but knew in his bones”) and avoids diagnostic labels. Maren functions as effective secondary pressure, her skepticism crystallizing into awe without sentimentality. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of needing validation—cost felt in her silence, not words.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—navigating the “geography of loss”—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the censer and notebook, and his micro-choices (answering the phone, tracing symbols) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief. His internal contradiction between seeking closure and enduring ambiguity is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. However, his backstory (sister’s disappearance) remains under-dramatized, functioning more as premise than pressure. The final choice to walk toward the horizon feels earned but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s involuntary truthfulness and pursuit of psychological safety manifest in embodied choices—burying the eye, pressing it to her socket—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (craving connection yet fearing exposure) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—accepting fear as necessary—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the loss of illusory safety. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile, sensory reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his routine, grief, and quiet curiosity feel lived-in. His micro-choice to investigate through observation rather than intrusion reveals a hierarchy of values (respect over curiosity) with visible cost: he inherits burdens not his own. The final renunciation—accepting borrowed memories—is earned by prior restraint and empathy. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (duty vs. compassion) simmer beneath calm surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and layered—his weariness, inherited duty, and latent curiosity feel lived-in. His micro-choice to follow the ants stems credibly from childhood habit, not convenience. The final act of inserting the chip feels earned by his tactile reverence for objects and quiet yearning for meaning beyond obligation. However, the shift from resignation to hope lacks a visible internal friction beat—his hesitation is noted but not dramatized as a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The queen’s interiority is richly embodied—her starlight-marked skin, her solitude, her shift from dread to acceptance—all rendered without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (ignoring court whispers, stepping into the grotto) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over power, memory over control. The final transformation feels earned through consistent internal logic and sensory grounding. No emotional summarizing; every feeling pulses through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her stained fingers, trembling hands, and breath hitching reveal emotional states without diagnostic labels. Her motivation to “capture the density of presence” evolves credibly into a shared act of co-creation with Elias, foreclosing her prior isolation. The final choice to uncork the vial and take his hand feels earned by her history of precision and poetic longing. Elias’s return “differently” tests her trust without melodrama, and their dynamic shifts subtly through micro-gestures rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—jealousy “coiling in his gut,” dreams leaving “a scream caught in his throat”—and his micro-choices (rereading the scroll, debating burning it) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His contradiction—craving clarity while resenting the past self who possessed it—is sustained and character-specific. The only flaw: his motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” edges toward abstraction without a concrete on-page attempt that fails or succeeds. Still, his emotional arc feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Clara are rendered with precise interiority, embodied emotion, and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—Elias’s tactile mapping, Clara’s still hands holding unsaid grief. Their motivations stem from consistent, specific losses (smell, lineage), and the final act of etching is earned by prior causality. The naming echo (“She named him Elias”) crystallizes identity without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory absence and object handling.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling fingers, crystallized ink, and scarred arms reveal grief as physical residue rather than abstract emotion. Her contradictory impulses (rejecting then embracing superstition) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to let ink flow freely—is earned by prior causality: her mother’s lesson, failed spells, and the crow quill’s history converge with visible cost (scars as stories). No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his guilt, metaphors, and tactile rituals reveal a man shaped by failure without self-pity. His micro-choices (uncorking the bottle, winding copper wire) are charged with history and cost. The final apology emerges not as epiphany but as earned reckoning, rooted in consistent traits. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through action, scent, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception (“fingers traced the spine,” “air hummed, too thin, too sharp”) and her contradictions—scholar vs. ghost, defier vs. vessel—are active in-scene. Her micro-choice to press the dictionary to the stone crystallizes her hierarchy of values with clear cost: she sacrifices solitude to become the weaver. However, her motivation leans slightly on concept (“to remember them—before the universe forgot them for her”) without deeper emotional friction or self-deception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile relationship with time, the worn key, and bloodied thumb reveal a man shaped by ritual and resistance. His motivation intensifies credibly from diagnostic curiosity to visceral intervention. The final epiphany (“clocks measured resistance”) emerges from action, not abstraction, and his renunciation of passive observation carries tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through precise physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., using the laser to track spores) and contradicted by his lingering attachment to surveillance tools. Mara’s presence functions as both mirror and catalyst, her history with him revealed without exposition. Their dynamic crystallizes in the final exchange, where mutual recognition carries emotional weight. However, Elias’s internal conflict lacks a visible struggle beyond contemplation; the shift feels elegant but slightly under-pressured for full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, debt, and intellectual inheritance collide in micro-choices like lighting the match or tracing her father’s ink. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion, calculation vs. faith) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—burning numbers to forge agency—is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (wet parchment, crumpled ticket, mica lantern).

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “cultivated estrangement” manifests in micro-choices like murmuring to grieving callers instead of correcting them. Her contradictions (desire for connection vs. chosen isolation) are consistent and active, not summarized. The final beat—“I think I’m ready” / “Good”—shows credible endurance with visible cost: she bears others’ grief without resolution. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies; emotion stays tactile and constrained by her role.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief manifests through tactile rituals (tracing the locket, arranging objects) rather than abstract lament. His contradiction—desperate preservation vs. necessary release—is dramatized in micro-choices (opening the locket repeatedly, then finally letting go). The final renunciation feels earned: his identity as archivist (“gently thorough”) directly conflicts with the sea’s erasure, making the locket’s release a credible, costly surrender. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in palpable loneliness, and his “desperately jocular” manner manifests in embodied gestures (adjusting frayed cuffs, forced laugh) that reveal internal contradiction. His final realization—that connection requires release, not hoarding—is earned through the logistician’s refusal to grant a literal cure, forcing him to reframe his need. The moon rock functions as both externalized longing and narrative catalyst, aligning action with emotional arc. No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges from sensory and symbolic pressure, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, longing, and rage coil through tactile perception rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (trusting the ring, pressing her palm to the tree) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: she surrenders cartographic control to embrace emotional legibility. The contradiction between her professional identity (mapmaker of “spaces between hearts”) and her personal need for self-understanding intensifies organically. Final renunciation—accepting that the stillpoint cannot be remapped—is earned by every prior sensory beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied doubt (“confidence was a fragile thing, a performance”) and micro-choices (handling the pen, accepting Elias’s nudge). Her flaw—overcautious editing of memory—is credibly tied to past error and shapes her hesitation. The relationship with Elias functions as crucible, applying gentle but essential pressure that culminates in her decision to act. Final renunciation of perfectionism (“All she had to do was decide what to keep”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is embodied through gesture, perception, and micro-choices (e.g., signing instead of speaking), avoiding diagnostic labels. Her quiet charisma is shown via Elias’s attuned responses, not stated. The flaw: Elias remains reactive, functioning more as mirror than crucible—his presence enables Lena’s expression but doesn’t pressure her into new stakes or irreversible choices. Final endurance (“felt seen”) is earned, though cost remains emotional rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deepened by her tactile engagement with the tapestry and portraits; the Ember Scribe’s fever-bright intensity reveals layered stakes without exposition. Both characters act from internal contradictions—Elara’s pursuit vs. empathy, the Scribe’s destruction vs. revelation—that crystallize in their final collaboration. Their dialogue carries subtext and distinct voice, though the Scribe’s backstory remains slightly under-pressured. The choice to help him feels earned through embodied discovery rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—remembering Liora—is consistent, deeply personal, and drives every action. His quietly rebellious nature manifests in tactile choices (drumming, sneaking into the garden) that carry emotional weight. Interiority is embodied (“nails tapping,” “serum burning like liquid starlight”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final fusion with Liora feels earned through escalating sensory entanglement, though the transformation borders on mystical without clearer psychological grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his tactile relationship with maps, the coin, and the labyrinth reveals a character shaped by pattern-recognition and quiet obsession. His micro-choices (counting paces, interpreting walks) align with his profession and personal mythos. The woman’s entrance introduces credible relational pressure without head-hopping; their exchange crystallizes mutual recognition rather than exposition. Final renunciation of sole ownership of the key feels earned through prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s silent craft is embodied through precise micro-choices—the mirror, the pebble, the shutter angles—that reveal her values without exposition. The girl’s presence tests but doesn’t transform Maris; instead, Maris enacts an Earned Stasis that forecloses connection with visible cost (isolation maintained). Interiority remains concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, the girl’s shift from accusation to acceptance lacks sufficient friction or contradictory impulse to fully earn her reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief and quiet resistance—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions (chess pieces, magnets, window displays). His internal conflict between futility and hope manifests in micro-choices: lingering after hours, unlocking the cabinet, stepping into the mist. The “forest of second thoughts” metaphor avoids therapy-speak by grounding it in action. However, his sister’s backstory slightly overshadows present agency, reducing the immediacy of his final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirien’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet, coiled ropes, and trembling hands convey a lifetime of self-erasure without exposition. Her final choice to stop fighting her nature feels earned through micro-choices (stealing the scrimshaw, wading into the sea) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The mother-figure’s dialogue avoids sentimentality by grounding revelation in tactile sensation (“touch cold but gentle”) and mythic logic. Only minor deduction for the epiphany arriving slightly too cleanly, though the whalebone’s disintegration mitigates over-clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—performing grief as rebellion while emotionally hollowed—is embodied through ritual, whittling, and narration. His micro-choices (boiling water, placing the bird) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on remembrance over compliance. The dried flowers and turbine imagery anchor his emotional stasis without diagnostic self-awareness. However, the wife exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s motivation—driven by an embodied “tremor of certainty”—is consistent and intensifies into action. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers traced the edges,” “limbs heavy with the weight”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. However, her choices lack visible contradiction; she moves with near-inevitability, reducing friction between desire and cost. The final renunciation of identity (“not as a poet”) is resonant but slightly under-pressured by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s colorblindness is not a gimmick but a lived constraint that shapes his artistic struggle and internal conflict. His micro-choices—arranging plants, accepting the shard, painting “the weight of colors”—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Liora’s “innocently cunning” demeanor manifests in action (her reed, her terms), not just label. The final brushstroke embodies earned transformation without epiphanic neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover the “texture of connection”—is embodied through tactile rituals and object interaction, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. His internal contradiction (seeking control vs. learning to listen) manifests in micro-choices like tracing the lamp lens or altering his pilgrimage. Dr. Veyra’s brief presence sharpens status dynamics without diluting focus. The final renunciation—accepting that connection isn’t discovered but awaited—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s grief is embodied with tactile precision—calloused fingers on enamel, the tattoo stencil as self-inflicted ritual—and his internal contradiction (clinging to Liora’s memory while being drawn toward release) manifests in micro-choices like pulling curtains shut then following coordinates. His final act of pressing the wet stencil to his wrist earns the shift from drowning in sorrow to wearing it, with visible cost in years of isolation. The child and Liora’s ghost function as off-stage pressures rather than full characters, preserving single-POV integrity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through object and action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her ink-stained cuffs, trembling hands, and whispered confessions reveal a mind shaped by loss and curiosity. Her “steadily curious” trait drives tangible choices: pressing cards, measuring edges, replying to the text. The final decision to step into the map feels earned through prior micro-choices, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than visceral. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatlining; contradictions (caution vs. compulsion) pulse beneath every action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“anguished joy,” “atoms of nostalgia… brushing against her skin”) and consistent contradiction—her pursuit of forbidden knowledge clashes with her stated goal to “purify” the archive. Her micro-choices (avoiding patterns, approaching Kael softly) reveal a hierarchy of values. The flaw: Kael’s sudden wisdom (“You have to let go”) risks tipping into diagnostic label-speak, though it’s partially redeemed by the tactile closure of their intertwined hands.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile attention to the stone, his deliberate movements, and his perceptual habits (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer”) cohere into a consistent, individualized consciousness. His motivation—to preserve hope through memory—is dramatized through micro-choices (comparing footage, placing the stone) that reveal hierarchy of values. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion arises through sensory detail and action, not label-speak. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure or contradiction limits the depth of internal conflict achievable in this solo frame.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his trembling fingers, his quiet smile that doesn’t reach his eyes, his shift from adhesive to tweezers—all reveal a man recalibrating gentleness into guarded resolve. His motivation (protecting the vulnerable while reconciling betrayal) intensifies believably, and his final act of trimming rather than reconstructing the tail embodies a nuanced renunciation. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation: “balance self-respect with compassion” edges toward diagnostic phrasing, though it’s immediately grounded by action. Still, the emotional arc feels earned, with visible cost in lost trust and revised identity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scar-tracing, plant telepathy, and coffee-ring reading reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche shaped by loss and quiet longing. His micro-choices (entering the tunnel despite warning, turning the hourglass) align with his motivation to decode scars as stories. The final renunciation of forgetting feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost legible in his still-wet coffee and shattered hourglasses. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—recovering unsent love letters through psychometry—is rooted in a vivid, consistent worldview and deepens under pressure. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied (“chest tightened,” “breath came in short, sharp bursts”) and contradictory (yearning for connection yet working alone in dust and silence). The final micro-choice—stealing the composer’s pen with wet ink—reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over ownership, resonance over possession. This renunciation of passive witnessing for active recovery is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and consistent—her moonstruck yearning, creative paralysis, and embodied tension (trembling fingers, breath in cold air) feel authentic. Her motivation to reclaim stardust-driven inspiration intensifies credibly, culminating in a release that reads as earned endurance rather than epiphany. However, the final shift leans slightly toward unearned transcendence; the trapped creativity “surges” without sufficient on-page friction or cost beyond exhaustion. The absence of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—only sequential despair then breakthrough—limits full character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his immunity to whispers, his duty-bound rigidity, and his quiet yearning for meaning all cohere. His micro-choice to touch the clock reveals a hierarchy of values (curiosity over obedience) with immediate cost: reality fractures. However, the shift from passive guard to active “cultivator” leans slightly on declarative revelation (“he understood”) rather than fully embodied struggle, softening the causal chain just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    The philosopher’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and embodied contradiction—his yearning for chaos clashes with the order he once inhabited. His micro-choice to clutch the gear and follow the wind demonstrates a hierarchy of values (truth over safety) with tangible cost: the loss of the mechanical world’s certainty. No diagnostic label-speak mars his epiphany; insight arises from tactile experience. The final step into the frontier feels earned by prior causality, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her courage “locked away in monotony,” her grip on the punch revealing tension without exposition. Her micro-choice to stamp her own ticket and now step ashore shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she trades safety for selfhood. Elias functions as a catalyst, not a full character, but his few lines carry weight through subtext. The only slip: Mira’s epiphany about courage being “traversed” borders on diagnostic label-speak, though it’s redeemed by immediate embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between numbness and pain, silence and truth—is rendered with precise, embodied contradiction. His micro-choices (kneeling, signing, refusing the music) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Madame Veyra functions as a credible secondary pressure without flattening into archetype. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he walks away from curated safety toward unresolved truth.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation is vividly rooted in her scholarly precision and moral resolve, embodied through tactile interactions with ink, scrolls, and runes. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through micro-choices—e.g., crushing the ink pellet to reveal truth, pressing the scroll to her chest like a heartbeat. The “diminutive titan” paradox is earned: physical smallness contrasts with unwavering purpose, culminating in a renunciation of violence for textual truth. However, her flawlessness edges toward idealization; a hairline slip in emotional complexity prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her scientific curiosity deepens into moral urgency as she uncovers erasure. Her interiority is embodied through tactile habits (tapping rhythms) and sensory perception, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice—to persist in reassembling truth—is earned by prior discovery beats and carries the cost of isolation in a decaying station. No secondary characters dilute focus; her struggle is credibly flawed and unshielded.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her bare feet on cold concrete, the hum in her bones—but her motivation leans slightly abstract (“find meaning in the shards”) without sufficient contradictory impulses acting *in scene*. The final choice feels earned through emotional buildup, yet lacks a micro-choice with visible tactical cost. Her “awkward confidence” is stated more than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—defying dogma to reclaim ancestral wisdom—is consistent, embodied, and intensified by her tactile relationship with the land. Her internal conflict (hearing plants but pretending not to) manifests in micro-choices: hiding dreams from Lina, deciphering symbols alone. The final act of unsealing is earned through decades of quiet resistance. However, Lina remains underdeveloped beyond symbolic function, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and free of diagnostic labels—her trauma manifests through tactile actions (tracing the veil, burying the photo) and somatic responses (freezing at drone hum). Mira’s “quietly talented” trait is shown through precise horticultural gestures, not stated. The final act—tending the sprouted cutting—is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing healing as an option while accepting its cost: she no longer crumples the photo, but keeps it smoothed, a quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling fingers, tangled threads, erasing the portrait—and his contradictory impulses (desire for answers vs. surrender to darkness) act simultaneously. His micro-choices (redesigning cards, erasing the canvas) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, the shift from despair to agency lacks a fully dramatized pivot; the “redesign” feels slightly epiphanic rather than wrested from struggle. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels mar the crisis, preserving emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—his albino eyes “sharp as broken glass,” his obsession with time’s behavior in crisis—but his final choice lacks full causal anchoring in prior beats. His “serene anger” feels evocative but not fully embodied through micro-choices that foreclose paths. The child’s recovery removes immediate pressure before Elias’s resolve crystallizes, softening the cost of his decision to pursue the time-thieves.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his trembling hands, breath fogging glass, and moral reckoning with silence feel specific and conflicted. His motivation (to provoke the Order by planting Seraphine’s letter) intensifies credibly from admiration to rebellion. The final act of renunciation—walking away without looking back—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: exile, surveillance, and the burden of unsaid truths. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception of leaf curl, wind-borne rain, and the tactile ritual of soil and roses reveals a character defined by quiet observation rather than action. Her micro-choice to sheathe the knife, not draw it, crystallizes her values against her father’s violence with palpable emotional cost. The father’s restrained reaction—jaw tightening, fingers brushing stitches—shows status shift without exposition. Their relationship functions as crucible: his bounty-hunting pragmatism clashes with her “senselessly perceptive” ethos, yet the rose gift forces a moment of unspoken recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is consistently embodied through micro-choices—kneeling to listen, zigzagging through the garden, voicing silence—and his internal conflict between skepticism and yearning pulses beneath restrained action. The rail spike functions as both talisman and tool, revealing his respect for the dead even while he disavows omens. His final act isn’t a tidy epiphany but a surrender to resonance, earned by prior restraint. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“reeds brushing like fingers of the dead”).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, suspicion, and resolve manifest through tactile interactions with the rosewood nib and inkwell. Her contradictions (devoted observer vs. active intervener) drive micro-choices with visible cost: sealing letters in wax, choosing to dig. The father’s backstory informs but doesn’t dictate her agency; her final decision feels earned. However, the journalist remains a voice, not a crucible, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied with visceral specificity—his trembling hands, the ink mixed with crushed amber, the constellation tattoos as ledger of loss. His internal contradiction (desire to silence cries vs. need to listen) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—inking the baby’s translated whisper into his skin—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: permanent self-inscription as penance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, object, and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s socially perceptive trait is concretely embodied—she reads shoulders and eyelids like mist—and her motivation to “discover meaning in the mess” drives micro-choices (e.g., leaning into the mandala) that escalate under pressure. Her internal contradiction—seeking order while surrounded by chaos—is sustained without therapy-speak. Maren functions as a crucible, not a foil, forcing Liora’s realization through dialogue that reveals their shared grief masked by unlearning. The final act of pressing the tile flake into sand earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, splintered memories, and tactile engagement with tesserae reveal a psyche shaped by trauma and resolve. Her contradictory impulses (vengeance vs. mercy, past vs. present) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to preserve Amira’s name while redefining its meaning—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through concrete action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s synesthetic perception grounds his interiority in vivid, character-specific embodiment, and Liora’s yearning is rendered through precise physical gestures (flickering edges, twitching fingers). Their contradictory impulses—Liora’s desire for an encore versus belief in impossibility, Elias’s hope versus awareness of fragility—act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to intertwine timelines emerges credibly from established traits and shared history, with the cost of emotional vulnerability legible in Liora’s trembling voice and blurred form.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s affectionate skepticism is vividly embodied in her tactile actions and internal contradictions—hugging while demanding proof, painting her body as both canvas and question. Her micro-choices (taking a placebo, tracing shock pathways) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: surrendering control to map the unknown. Eli functions effectively as crucible, his quiet presence forcing her toward agency rather than rescue. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions remain sensorially grounded even at peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath, clutching hands, and raw voice convey fear and awe without diagnostic labels. Her motivation (to map the unseen) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a resonant renunciation: she accepts becoming a vessel. The elm fossil anchors her emotional arc, and her final micro-choice—to let the entity merge with her—is earned by prior causality. No safety-hedging; her flaw (obsessive listening) becomes her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through tactile engagement with objects—buttons, echo, hourglass—revealing her quiet obsession and moral restraint. Her refusal to believe in prophecy yet act as its weaver demonstrates layered contradiction. The final choice to turn the hourglass again, not to reverse time but to recalibrate it, is earned by every micro-decision in cataloging. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture, texture, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scar, pillbox, and snow codes all externalize internal conflict without therapy-speak. His final choice feels earned: not redemption, but stewardship of abandoned courage. The “prudently daring” trait manifests in micro-choices (e.g., delaying opening the pillbox) that align with his history of calculated risk. However, the transition from passive regret to active resolve lacks a visible struggle beat, slightly softening the causality of his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile relationship with the needle, his ambient awareness, and his quiet reckoning with loss all feel earned. His motivation (“to distill complexity into essence”) is dramatized through action (mending under storm pressure) rather than stated abstraction. The final renunciation of urgency in favor of “spindrift serenity” is a credible endurance that forecloses anxiety with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ren’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his phototropism to kindness, tactile relationship with clay and glass, and quiet endurance reveal a coherent emotional logic. His final realization feels earned through sensory accumulation rather than epiphany. However, his motivation lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; he observes and receives, but never wrestles with a competing desire that would deepen agency. The cost of his presence—what he sacrifices to stay—is implied but not embodied in a decisive micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied—dirt under nails, the rosebush’s final petal—and his micro-choices (leaving the fire escape unlocked, handing over the gauge) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet stewardship. Lila’s presence functions as crucible without over-explaining; their dynamic conveys mutual grief through gesture, not exposition. The “wistfully pragmatic” trait manifests in action (“Where else would I be?”) rather than label. However, the final belief shift leans slightly toward unearned epiphany without sufficient prior doubt dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, brittle awakening, and tactile communion with the sundial ground her emotional arc. Her micro-choices (aligning the dial, pressing her palm to the floor) reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring memory without surrendering to it. The final renunciation isn’t of the past but of isolation as identity, earned through sustained pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (longing vs. self-protection) act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her ghostwriting profession isn’t stated but revealed through tactile longing (“invisible stitches binding hearts”) and micro-choices (tracing the nest, folding her letter into a lotus). Her contradictory impulses—to connect others while remaining unseen—animate every beat without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (“I think I just stopped looking for it”) feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost: years of anonymity crystallized in a single twig.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, fogged breath, and cautious hope feel specific and pressured. Her motivation (to disrupt cosmic tricksters through subtlety) intensifies credibly under rising communal chaos. Voss functions effectively as secondary pressure, his skepticism crystallizing into awe without over-explaining. The final choice—activating silence against noise—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of potential total loss.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and obsession are embodied with visceral specificity (“fingers digging into the cold metal,” “vision blurred”), and his final choice to grasp the compass feels earned by his prior desperation. His internal contradiction—fear of confinement versus compulsion to uncover truth—drives every micro-choice. The figure’s ambiguity avoids over-explanation, preserving Elias’s POV-bound knowledge. However, the transition from terror to resolve lacks a final hesitation beat that would crystallize the cost of seeing “the truth.”

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face blindness is embodied through tactile perception and consistent interior logic; her methodical nature drives micro-choices like tracing the ribbon or integrating the lance into her sketch. The sister-figure’s motivation feels slightly under-anchored—her sudden appearance lacks prior signal—but Elara’s final act of drawing as empathic witness is earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through physical sensation (sweat on satin, fogged spectacles). Flawed yet capable, she avoids safety-hedging by embracing emotional risk in reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “nervous confidence” manifests in tactile actions (tracing journals, clutching the nail) and credible emotional layering (dread replacing confidence). Her motivation stems from ancestral loyalty but collides with rising personal stakes, creating a hierarchy of values tested at the furnace. The final choice to enter the passage feels earned through her progressive decoding and growing identification with Elias. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s motivation—“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—is embodied through micro-choices: playing for absent travelers, pocketing the glass flake, walking into uncertainty. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile perception (damp wool scarf, crunching gravel) and sensory attunement. The hitchhiker’s absence functions as pressure, not a relationship crucible, fitting single-POV scope. Final renunciation—choosing not-knowing over answers—is earned by her lifelong pattern of investing hope in fragile traces.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his inherited “polished calm” manifests not as stoicism but as a mode of listening, contrasting his father’s intimidation. His micro-choices (spreading the bills, deciding to leave) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the surrender of cyclical return for spiral growth. The backstory integrates cleanly through present stimuli (the train, the pouch), and his final smile at the fox crystallizes earned emotional evolution without therapy-speak. Only slight abstraction in “quiet terror of being left behind” edges toward label—but it’s redeemed by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—trembling fingers, fogged eyepiece, clenched fists—and his shift from chronicler to witness feels earned. His flaw (over-focus on decoding over connection) directly impedes understanding until the climax. The epiphany avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in sensory dream-logic and the daylily metaphor. However, Liora remains off-page, limiting relational crucible despite her thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veyra’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, memories, and moral burden are rendered through tactile sensation and micro-choices under pressure. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. guilt, truth vs. concealment) operate simultaneously in the climactic scene, not as alternating summaries. The frozen confession is earned through prior causality: her failure to act during the raid directly informs her present renunciation of self-deception. Final endurance (“she would have to live with it”) forecloses denial with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scar, his rootedness, his refusal to look away—all cohere into a consistent, flawed visionary. His motivation (to find the intersection of dreams) is dramatized through tactile choices: plucking the clipping, stepping forward despite fear. The woman’s arrival tests his endurance, and his final belief in “together” feels earned by prior isolation. Minor deduction: the internal contradiction between fear and hope isn’t simultaneous under pressure but sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and reckless idealism, with embodied contradictions—“fiercely gentle hands,” hesitation versus resolve—that culminate in a credible renunciation. Her choice to surrender the defining memory is earned through layered micro-choices (carving sigils, pressing coins) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final act of relinquishment carries visible emotional cost: forgetting his voice, widening the soul’s hole. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jake’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his reliance on facts masks grief, and his micro-choices (folding the cloth, identifying the pickaxe) reveal a hierarchy of values. Lena’s arrival tests his emotional insulation without resolving it neatly. The “confidently uncertain” line risks therapy-speak but lands because it’s undercut by embodied hesitation. Motivation stems from consistent traits, though the Albuquerque backstory slightly over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in analogical thinking and physics-based skepticism—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions with the seed and cuneiform. Her “kindly methodical” nature manifests in micro-choices (pressing the seed, taking notes) that reveal hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: belief in transformation vs. disbelief in souls. Final endurance (“neither was she”) earns closure without epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s hybrid nature and internal contradiction—man/machine, preservation/creation—are embodied in precise physical detail and micro-choices (e.g., selecting books by feel, placing them in the creel). His motivation to “preserve wonder in routine” is dramatized through action, not stated as doctrine. The final act of release is earned by his earlier acceptance of liminality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her fear of being forgotten, her hesitation, the weight of inherited duty—all rendered through tactile perception (the pearl against her ribs, quartz under boots). Her micro-choices (touching confessions, placing the crown) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she dissolves others’ grief only to confront her own. The final whispered confession feels earned, not epiphanic, and aligns with her grandmother’s warning. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the weight of the accordion, the tactile tracing of graffiti—and her contradictions (truth-seeker vs. failure, chronicler vs. fugitive) drive micro-choices with palpable cost. The backstory of the drowning is tightly anchored to present action via the map and music, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her final renunciation of forgiveness in favor of living with truth feels earned by prior causality. However, the phrase “daringly methodical” edges toward label-only description without fully manifesting as a constraining trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is richly embodied—her cautious exuberance, tactile engagement with the watch and cipher, and trembling voice reading the unsent letter all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her final act of writing the second letter is earned through prior micro-choices (tracing symbols, documenting, hesitating then acting), and the cost—surrendering control to an unseen force—is felt in her relinquishment of scholarly detachment. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through action and sensory detail. The cipher-driven motivation remains consistent and intensifies credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between filial duty and intellectual autonomy—is rendered with embodied specificity (gloves stiff with cold, breath fogging) and contradictory impulses that coexist under pressure. Her telepathic connection to plants isn’t just a trait but a lived tension that escalates into active opposition. The final choice to play the violin is earned through micro-decisions: stepping back, tightening her grip, reading the stains. Flaws are integrated without safety-hedging; her passivity early on makes her agency at climax feel costly, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath “curling like silver thread,” her “heart aching with the beauty”—and her dual identity as beautician-mortician informs every micro-choice. Her motivation (to honor thresholds) is consistent, rooted in past transformation, and culminates in a credible endurance (Earned Stasis). The final renunciation—accepting impermanence while still intervening—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her aching forgiveness, creaking bones, and moss-tending routine reveal a layered past without exposition. Her motivation (seeking joy beyond pain) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: climbing the tree, pocketing the hairpin, descending into the pool. The final act of releasing the hairpin earns her peace through prior causality, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; contradictions (forgiveness vs. unrest) coexist organically.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his frayed coat, the mirror shard’s cold weight, the “cloak of doubt” as visceral sensation—and his micro-choices (listening to chimes, asking about fear) reveal a hierarchy of values. Veyra’s trembling hands and “protected vulnerability” deepen their dynamic without sentimentality. However, the transition from Elias’s skepticism to empathy lacks a clear turning-point beat; the shift feels atmospheric rather than earned through causally pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her fear, self-deception, and longing are rendered through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., admitting fear as the “first thread”). The delayed revelation about her grandmother reconfigures her motive without epiphanic neatness. However, the absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible depth, and the transformation leans slightly more on insight than costly action. Still, her renunciation of linear time feels earned through prior emotional groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to learn navigation without motion—is embodied through tactile interaction with the skimmer and arrowhead, not stated abstractly. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via breath, pulse, and physical sensation. The final renunciation (choosing to “wander echoes forever”) is earned by prior choices and carries the cost of permanent liminality. Contradictory impulses—yearning for discovery vs. reverence for stillness—operate simultaneously in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—numb fingers, threadbare robes, shame over failed spells—and his contradiction (seeking the divine yet rejecting grandeur) drives every choice. The figure in the courtyard refracts his self-doubt without collapsing into exposition. His final act—planting light, not casting a spell—earns his transformation through consistent micro-choices. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; his epiphany emerges from tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his hands steady, skin prickling, pulse quickening—and his micro-choices (wandering to the *Marigold*, following the woman) reveal a hierarchy of values. The late appearance of the woman risks flattening Elias’s agency, but her role functions as a catalyst rather than a resolver. His final act—pressing the key tag into her hand—is earned by prior mystery and emotional buildup. However, the “hollow ache” shared between them verges on abstract without deeper differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his fingers tracing coins, breath fogging glass—and his emotional shift from fire to embers feels earned. His micro-choices (spilling coins, listening to static) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the final turn toward readiness leans slightly on conceptual clarity over visceral contradiction; the “quietly enthusiastic” smile lacks friction with his earlier doubt. No diagnostic label-speak, but the epiphany borders on unearned without deeper struggle in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to give names to nameless fears—is deeply embodied through tactile interactions with the atlas, light, and recordings. His internal contradiction (reaping vs. remembering) manifests in micro-choices: tracing cracks, replaying cylinders until voices become his own, whispering stolen names. The final renunciation (“he had given something back”) is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost: centuries of weight lifted only after naming the unnamed. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in bone, ink, and fractured rainbows.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s earnest naivety and flawed competence are consistently embodied in micro-choices—his rejection of fire-mending, his obsessive drip-counting—that reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet devotion rather than grand heroism. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile ritual (“watching as the metal drank it in like a thirsty man”). The final laugh—“brittle as the bell’s devotion”—captures earned vulnerability without sentimentality. Motivation remains credible throughout, grounded in sensory obsession rather than abstract duty.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior conflict—between inherited narrative and discovered truth—is rendered through concrete, embodied choices (handling photographs, pocketing the label) rather than abstract reflection. His motivation (“precisely humane” stewardship of memory) intensifies credibly as evidence accumulates. The final decision to carry the photos back feels earned by prior causality, with visible emotional cost in his breath catching and bones “settling.” However, Mira remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, tightened grip on the crystal, and suppressed sentimentality reveal a credible tension between logic and wonder. Her micro-choices (plucking, kneeling, releasing) reflect a hierarchy of values with visible cost: relinquishing control over magic. The epiphany feels earned through prior struggle, not diagnostic label-speak. Only minor deduction for slightly tidy emotional resolution at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is clearly rooted in his identity as a watcher turned participant, and his internal conflict between observation and action manifests physically through precise micro-choices (e.g., knotting the vine, using the buckle). His emotional state is embodied without therapy-speak, and his competence (“attentively inventive”) is balanced by genuine struggle during the fall and climb. The near-fall sequence reveals contradictory impulses: fear versus resolve, passivity versus agency. However, the backstory about the parachute failure leans slightly toward summary rather than dramatization, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and embodied—numbness as a “canvas,” fists curling, breath hitching—and his contradictory impulses (craving feeling yet fearing its return) act simultaneously in scene. His micro-choices (watching Veyra’s feet, lunging with precision) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of ego-driven identity (“I don’t have to be the original or the copy”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing a self-narrative. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her trembling fingers, pulse quickening, and redesigning puzzles under pressure reveal a character shaped by curiosity and trauma. Her motivation to protect innovation feels earned through micro-choices (moving the pot inside, locking doors, altering blueprints). However, the childhood greenhouse memory arrives without prior anchoring, slightly undercutting the emotional causality. The final stance crystallizes credibly, though the father’s absence remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in shared grief and his identity as a former conductor, compellingly expressed through micro-choices like adjusting the blower’s angle and persisting despite sputtering fuel. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through embodied actions—trembling hands, breath hitching—while tending silence as a gardener tends blooms. The girl’s emergence forces no grand transformation but crystallizes his purpose: he came not to be seen, yet stays present long enough for laughter to return. His final renunciation—walking away—is earned, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing (“dimensionally homesick”) and micro-choices (touching the blank page, following the guardian). Her motivation—making friends with uncertainty—is dramatized rather than declared, and her final renunciation of waiting feels earned. The pendant and garden serve as pressure points that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, the guardian’s role limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, buried emotions, and stoic sensitivity manifest in concrete choices. His epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through tactile interaction with the crozier and mercury. The final renunciation of perfection for transformation feels earned by two decades of failure dramatized in ledger entries and acid-stained skin. His micro-choice to stop flinching during explosions crystallizes a credible, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her search for “the beginning in every ending” drives concrete actions, like pressing the Hollywood fragment to the interpreter. Her epiphany feels earned through tactile engagement rather than abstract musing. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see conviction shift, not struggle. The renunciation of linear time reads as credible endurance with tangible cost: her physical disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in his belief that “light slips through the cracks”—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (securing lines, handling the hourglass) and micro-choices under pressure. His “resiliently positive” trait avoids sentimentality by anchoring hope in active witnessing, not denial. Interiority remains concrete (“fingers calloused but gentle,” breath curling in cold air), though secondary characters lack depth beyond symbolic function. The final renunciation—accepting the ferry’s transient fate—carries quiet cost, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover the texture of connection—is embodied through his fever-dream architecture and deepened by his calm surrender to the thread’s logic. His internal contradiction (rationality vs. enchantment) plays out in real time, not summary, and his final choice to follow the thread feels earned. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are rendered through perception (“feet sinking like quicksand”) and micro-choices (reaching, following, stepping through). However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirien’s interiority is vividly embodied—her curiosity, wariness, and determination manifest through tactile actions (tracing the chain, adjusting her visor) rather than abstract reflection. Her motivation intensifies credibly from observation to experimentation, culminating in a stance that forecloses Veyth’s old limits. The “balancedly curious” trait drives micro-choices with cost: time spent outside the city, social friction with Tael. However, her internal contradiction remains slightly muted—awe outweighs fear too cleanly by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is rooted in persistent curiosity and grief, embodied through tactile choices (clutching the photograph, adjusting the hearing aid). Her internal conflict between fear and duty manifests physically (“breath hitched,” “fingers tightened”), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final run toward Miriam feels earned by prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: listening over safety. Minor deduction for Elias’s underdeveloped presence limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s claustrophobia, guilt, and resolve are embodied through precise physical reactions and micro-choices (e.g., trembling fingers, kneeling “not to join, but to stand by”). His motivation—atonement for past abandonment—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final renunciation (accepting entombment) is earned by his prior failure and current sacrifice. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting in sensory dread and tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his heartbeat-counting, the porcelain shard, the death certificate—all embody his fear of borrowed time without slipping into diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (carrying the shard, rereading the ghost’s words) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief and guilt. The final moment of stillness feels earned, not epiphanic, as he accepts the space between mistakes as his own. No secondary characters dilute focus; the ghost functions as projection, not person.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—translating echo-texture into tangible form—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal contradiction (skepticism of curses vs. belief in patterns) fuels credible choices. The final act of “conducting” echoes reveals a hierarchy of values: understanding over safety. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile perception (“fingers traced the walls,” “hands trembling”).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his bitterness, weariness, and fatal curiosity cohere through micro-choices like withholding the arrowhead and gripping the phone. His arc from observer to participant feels earned, though his final metamorphosis leans slightly on thematic inevitability over fully dramatized psychological rupture. Maren exerts credible pressure as a threshold guardian, but her motives remain opaque, limiting relational depth. The “bitterness as gravity” metaphor informs his stance without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tension between duty and yearning. Her micro-choices—adjusting her bow, leaping off the bridge—are consistent with her established motive to preserve beauty through music. The final shift from passive guardian to active fighter feels earned, though the child’s introduction slightly dilutes Liora’s singular arc. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jace’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his quiet endurance masks grief, guilt, and futility. His micro-choices (keeping undeliverable letters, carrying the storm bottle) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in honoring absences. Mira’s presence sharpens his stakes without diluting his autonomy; their dynamic feels lived-in, not expositional. The final decision to carry both letters and storm embodies Earned Stasis with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his silence as a “language of its own” manifests through micro-choices (tracing wood, humming) that reveal his worldview without exposition. His motivation to “interpret silence as possibility” drives every action and culminates in the earned decision to sing, which reconfigures reality. The final laugh and ride embody a credible emotional shift rooted in persistent character logic. No diagnostic label-speak or unmotivated epiphanies mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile relationship with books, his quiet obsession with narrative space, and his restrained yearning all feel lived-in. The woman’s silent presence functions as effective pressure without over-explaining her motives. However, her sudden recognition (“You found it”) lacks sufficient prior groundwork to fully earn the emotional pivot; their connection hinges more on premise than reciprocal character causality. Still, Elias’s final choice—to accept the scarf as anchor—feels consistent and carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—driven by a dream of light and the word “vitalize”—is consistent, embodied through tactile actions (painting with light, using the camera), and intensifies credibly. His internal contradiction between quiet routine and restless longing manifests in micro-choices: returning daily to the window, switching from paint to photography. The final encounter reveals earned emotional progression without over-articulation. However, the woman remains underdeveloped as a crucible; her role is symbolic rather than interactive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his quiet competence, reverence for trapped truths, and burdened resolve feel earned. Elara’s trembling voice and unspoken request reveal her internal conflict without exposition. Their micro-choices (giving the hair, braiding it, saying “Tell it”) carry visible emotional cost. However, the final smile borders on tidy resolution; a trace more ambiguity in her readiness would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensation and obsessive curiosity, with micro-choices (pressing his palm to the earth, returning after decades) revealing a hierarchy of values. His flaw—fixation on memory recovery—drives inevitable mistakes and culminates in a costly near-reunion. Liora’s appearance crystallizes their relationship as crucible, though her characterization leans spectral rather than fully dimensional. The final renunciation (reaching too late) earns its emotional weight through consistent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her backward walking, fractured reflection, and shadow-annotating reveal deep contradictions between guilt and mentorship. Mira’s presence forces micro-choices that expose Elara’s hierarchy of values: protecting vulnerability over preserving exile. The flaw—diagnostic phrasing like “combative tenderness”—nearly breaches authenticity but is offset by tactile details (ink-smelling hands, scuffed boots). Final renunciation isn’t tidy; cost lingers in the unanswered question of whether teaching Mira undoes her exile.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s motivation is deeply rooted in preserving wonder, not just apples, and her micro-choices—singing, planting at the runoff-rich edge—reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. Her interiority is concrete (“hands calloused,” “insatiably creative mind”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final endurance (sitting back, trembling) reads as Earned Stasis: she forecloses passive forgetting by actively mending the veil. No secondary characters dilute focus, and her flaws (loneliness, urgency) shape her credible struggle without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—driven by haunted dreams and a restorer’s duty—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (restoration vs. unmaking) manifests in trembling hands and decisive action. The Fisher King’s appearance sharpens the moral stakes without resolving them neatly. Final choice is earned, with visible cost: the mask’s destruction and unleashed suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is deeply woven into his profession and choices, culminating in a final realization that feels earned. His interiority is concrete (“methodically curious,” tracing the map’s tear), and his emotional response to the child’s shoe is embodied, not diagnostic. The story avoids tidy resolution: he doesn’t solve the mystery but accepts its unfinished nature. His flaw—obsessive attention to marginalia—drives both his insight and his isolation, with visible cost in social alienation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his analytic detachment, embodied grief (“Death had been his first name”), and micro-choices (hesitating before releasing the globe) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. His final renunciation feels earned by prior causality: he chooses release over possession, foreclosing recovery of Liora’s work with palpable cost. The ghostly encounter avoids sentimentality through sensory restraint (“crackle of an old radio”) and maintains character-bound knowledge until the revelation. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to give voice to the unheard—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the bolt plate and lute. His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. belief in ghosts) resolves credibly under pressure. The ghost’s silent communication forces micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values: empathy over safety. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through action (“fingers stilling on the lute strings”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her curiosity wars with reverence, her empathy with trespass. Her micro-choice to return the goggles and diary reveals a hierarchy of values (respect over knowledge) with visible emotional cost. The captain’s restrained grief feels earned, not performative, and their power dynamic sharpens every exchange. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in trembling fingers, held breath, and tactile interactions with charged objects.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling hands, fogged eyepiece, and cloud taxonomy reveal a psyche shaped by grief and obsession. His final choice to step off the gondola feels earned through accumulated micro-decisions (adjusting the telescope, logging clouds) that reconfigure his relationship to memory. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail rather than abstraction. However, his shift from passive observer to leaper lacks a clear internal pivot—his “steadied” hands feel slightly abrupt without a dramatized recalibration of fear or desire.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s prosopagnosia is not a gimmick but the engine of her perception and choices; her refusal to take the sketch is an Earned Stasis that forecloses possession with visible cost. Her internal contradiction—longing to capture the sky yet recognizing its sacred unownability—is embodied in tactile, specific detail (“fingers lingering,” “pulse steady”). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory filtering. The final renunciation feels inevitable because it grows from her lifelong practice of seeing absence as presence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “diligently curious” trait manifests through embodied actions—tracing charts, brushing dust from the hopscotch board—and culminates in a micro-choice (copying the pattern) that earns his master’s recognition. His internal contradiction between reverence for tradition and hunger for discovery remains consistent. Orlan functions as both mentor and gatekeeper, applying immediate pressure by withholding the lantern until Elias proves himself. The final cost is subtle but legible: Elias trades passive apprenticeship for active discovery, with the airship’s course irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—learning “the rhythm of repair”—is embodied through tactile actions (tracing spines, arranging gears) and deepened by his fear of the hall of mirrors. His internal conflict between avoidance and necessity feels authentic, though the epiphany about being a “bridge” borders on diagnostic without sufficient prior struggle. The final renunciation isn’t dramatized as a choice with cost but as a realization, slightly weakening earned endurance. Still, micro-choices (entering the hall, kneeling before a reflection) reveal consistent values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—orchestrating collective care without coercion—is consistent and embodied through her ghostly interventions. Her interiority is conveyed economically via sensory detail (flickering like a candle, watering “in her own way”) rather than diagnostic labels. The child’s intuition and the mother’s glowing fingers subtly externalize Liora’s emotional stakes without over-explaining. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched archetypes (the hoarding farmer, the weaver), limiting relational depth despite clear choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, steady breath, bruised awe—and his contradictory impulses (to delay vs. release the end) act simultaneously in scene. His final choice to hum the lullaby is earned by decades of turning back time, with visible cost: surrendering control, accepting impermanence. The puppet head functions as a mirror, not a prop, deepening his self-recognition without diagnostic label-speak. Flawed yet dignified, he reads as an individual shaped by ritual, loss, and quiet devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and conflicted—her guilt, reluctance, and resolve coexist without tidy resolution. Her micro-choices (pocketing the nut, scattering them silently) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by the curse’s moral calculus. The man’s arrival tests her stance, and her refusal to intervene directly—offering only indirect guidance—feels earned by prior causality. Final renunciation carries visible emotional cost: “The guilt sat in her chest like a stone,” echoed in her breath-clouded stillness at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lina’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, regret, and professional identity manifest through tactile interactions (moss, chrysalis, river foam). Her contradictory impulses (desire for control vs. need for connection) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The estrangement with Mara feels earned and specific, not generic. However, the final shift toward reconciliation leans slightly on conceptual clarity over messy human friction, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—seeking the origin of stories while inscribing a fading name—and his micro-choices (tracing the bottle, accepting the sigh-coin) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The woman’s presence pressures his stance without resolving his quest, preserving ambiguity. His emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, layering longing with resignation. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt-stung fingers, phantom ache of grief—and her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing palm, taking Kael’s hand) reveal a hierarchy of values: carrying pain over erasing it. Kael’s hollow eyes and curled posture convey his emotional state without exposition. Their interaction avoids therapy-speak; grief is tactile, contagious, syrup-thick. The final renunciation—choosing remembrance without drowning—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of ongoing sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in multilingual empathy and her grandfather’s legacy—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her micro-choices (installing the weight, posting multilingual posters) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time, labor, emotional vulnerability. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; she faces no real resistance or doubt, flattening emotional complexity. The resolution feels earned but lacks friction that would deepen character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—obsession vs. despair, collector vs. modifier—and her final renunciation (“You don’t have to fix it. Just remember it”) feels earned by prior micro-choices. The “helix-minded” trait manifests in chaotically precise movements that reveal her cognitive rhythm under pressure. However, the woman in the mirror remains a projection rather than a fully realized secondary presence, limiting relational crucible depth. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s prism-minded interiority is vividly rendered through concrete perception and micro-choices (e.g., tracing carvings, trembling hands), avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—deciphering forgotten combinations—is consistent and embodied in her satchel adjustments and breath control. However, the final renunciation lacks a tangible trade-off; she gains the unmarked book without visible loss, weakening Earned Stasis. The story implies cost (“a flame in the dark”) but doesn’t dramatize it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in his identity as a “tree-song sculptor,” and his actions—tracing cracks, inserting the insulator, strumming with intent—reveal a coherent interiority shaped by loss and longing. His empathy isn’t stated but enacted, and the final choice to coax sound from broken wood feels earned, not epiphanic. The hedgehog’s presence subtly externalizes his internal shift without dialogue or exposition. Minor deduction: the transition from passive observer to active creator lacks a micro-hesitation that would heighten the cost of making noise in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his exile, teaching philosophy, and reliance on the worry stone reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Lysara’s calloused hands and “translating silence” establish her as more than foil; their mutual recognition feels earned. The final choice to stay carries quiet cost: he accepts continued exile to witness meaning unfold. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars their emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile focus on silence, resonance, and the diary clasp reveals a coherent, idiosyncratic worldview. His contradiction (anger vs. reverence upon Liora’s return) feels authentic, not performative. Micro-choices—adjusting frequencies, resisting confrontation—align with his pacifist, intuitive nature. The final act of listening, not demanding answers, earns his renunciation with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s ambition and olfactory sensitivity are concretely embodied, driving micro-choices like unwrapping the seed and journaling. Her internal contradiction—between urgency and patience—is resolved not by epiphany but through inherited wisdom that reframes her goal. Nara functions effectively as pressure, not exposition, and their exchange reveals status dynamics without overstatement. The final renunciation of immediate bloom for long-term tending carries visible cost: years of labor with no guarantee.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her search for resilience is grounded in tactile memory (the arrow tip) and embodied urgency (gravity inversion). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through physical sensation (“breath curling,” “pulse quicken”). The final choice—to stay and absorb the echoes—is earned by her prior reverence for the groves. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and grounded in professional habit (“Foresight in action”), with embodied reactions (palms on steel, breath shallow) and micro-choices (documenting wind, scanning heat) that reveal his hierarchy of values. His past as a flight engineer informs present tactics without exposition, and his shift from instrument-trust to intuition feels earned. However, the final renunciation lacks a decisive internal beat—his run reads reactive rather than chosen, weakening the cost legibility required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eira’s synesthetic perception grounds her motivation in sensory specificity, and her struggle against the sculptor’s interruptions reveals a hierarchy of values: wonder over noise, stillness over chaos. Her micro-choices—ringing bells in sequence despite repeated disruptions—show credible endurance under pressure. The flaw is slight over-articulation in her internal rationale (“certify wonder as essential”), which edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by embodied action. Final renunciation of failure feels earned through three escalating attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—harvesting insight from failure—is grounded in personal history and embodied through trembling hands, hesitant breaths, and tactile interaction with the flute. His internal conflict (guardian by inheritance, not choice) manifests in micro-choices: kneeling, uncasing, stepping through the tear. The final renunciation of “sealing” in favor of “weaving” is earned by prior struggle, though the emotional cost remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, borrowed voices, barnacle-like empathy—and his contradictions (precision vs. poetic drift) drive micro-choices under pressure. His motivation (“mathematics of emotion”) feels personal and obsessive, not abstract. The final hollow quiet reads as earned stasis with palpable cost: loss of borrowed selves, unresolved equations, vanished stars. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courier’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the pendant’s hum against her collarbone—and her micro-choices (not slowing when the stranger appears, closing her eyes to follow vibrations) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by wonder over routine. Her contradiction between professional detachment and growing awe feels authentic, not tidy. The mentor’s absence functions as emotional ballast without over-explaining her motives. Final renunciation of mere delivery in favor of threshold-crossing is earned through tactile, sensory buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his breath, numb fingers, and tactile engagement with frost and quartz ground his emotional state. His motivation (to prove objects absorb emotion) intensifies into communion, not mere belief, and culminates in a resonant realization that transforms understanding without tidy resolution. The memory of his mother and the prior visitor are woven through sensory cues, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the lack of active choice beyond passive reception slightly limits agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile relationship with thread, shawl, and bead reveals layered regret and resolve without diagnostic labels. Her choice to leave stems credibly from decades of silence and a single resonant plea, not abstract duty. The final renunciation (“the silence was no longer a weight. It was a beginning”) earns its poise through prior accumulation of loss. However, Kael’s presence lacks reciprocal pressure; he functions more as a symbol than a crucible, slightly weakening relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his quiet determination manifests in micro-choices (e.g., unfolding the silk “with reverence,” working through the night). His flaw (being overlooked) directly enables his solution, and the cost (physical exhaustion, solitude) is embodied. However, the lack of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing, and the internal contradiction (“meek” vs. “defiance”) is implied more than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile handling of the shard, breath fogging in cold air, and pulse-synced hum ground his emotional state. His choice at the end feels earned by prior micro-decisions: adjusting harness, activating scanner, gripping the shard. The doppelgänger encounter reveals contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution) without therapy-speak. However, the other Kael’s scars and flight suit lack reciprocal pressure that would deepen Kael’s internal conflict beyond surface-level recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s reticence, grief, and yearning are embodied through tactile actions—tying ropes, stacking stones, handling sea glass—not diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection, duty vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene, especially when he chooses to build a reply despite never writing back before. The final renunciation of solitude is earned by prior causality: each anonymous note incrementally reshapes his capacity to believe he’s not alone. Cost is felt in the weight of the sea glass left behind—a talisman surrendered as trust.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veyra’s motivation is deeply rooted in her past as a printer’s child and crystallizes in her present role as architect of light; her joy-as-key trait feels earned, not decorative. Interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, laughter that trembles the wick—and her final mirroring gesture carries emotional weight without over-explanation. The vision of the unborn city forces a micro-choice (adjusting the lantern) that reconfigures her purpose with palpable cost: she must now steward a future she cannot enter yet. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dye master’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his restlessness, his watchfulness, his grief for an unknown donor—all rendered through tactile perception (tracing the wing, tracking light) rather than abstraction. His micro-choice to engage the storyteller shifts his trajectory meaningfully. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of pursuit: he stops searching because he recognizes the iridescence was never in the pigment but in the encounter. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from image and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his numb hand, his offerings to the walls, his mapping rituals—all revealing a man shaped by loss and quiet devotion. His motivation intensifies organically from maintenance to stewardship, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses escape but accepts burden. The final choice—to carry the sextant and return—is earned through tactile, embodied progression rather than epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through sensation ("roots unfurling") and action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally grounded, with embodied hesitation (“fingers trembled,” “throat tight”) that escalates credibly to her climactic act of singing. The memory keeper functions as a catalyst rather than a full character, but her role is coherent within the single-POV scope. Elara’s internal conflict—fear of forgetting versus duty to restore hope—is rendered through concrete micro-choices (planting the seed, beginning to sing despite doubt). Her final endurance carries visible cost: raw throat, emotional exposure—earned stasis that forecloses passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his calloused hands moving with gentleness, his regret over the turned-away woman—and his final choice feels earned by consistent traits. The contradiction between “staying while leaving” and the need to act crystallizes in a credible emotional arc. However, the backstory block (the woman) slightly exceeds BRR limits without sufficient interleaved micro-choices; it’s anchored but leans toward summary. Still, his empathy drives tangible action, and the cost of unmaking a mistake is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his noticing of “slippages” manifests in concrete perception, not abstraction. His micro-choice to plant the seeds emerges credibly from grief and obsession, not epiphany. The woman remains enigmatic but functions as catalyst, not crutch. Flaws (fixation on erasure) directly shape his arc and final act.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his devotion to preservation, and his final act of stabilization earns emotional weight. His interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied (“breath curling,” “fingers trembling”). However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—his resolve feels singular rather than wrestled from doubt. The vow’s burden resonates, but the absence of active resistance within him slightly flattens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath, grip on the watch fob, and steadied voice under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by legacy and loss. Her motivation (“to capture the sound of trust breaking”) is unusual yet grounded in her identity as a smuggler’s daughter. The final intervention feels earned: she leverages her father’s reputation and the symbolic weight of the fob to defuse violence without overreaching competence. Minor deduction: the victim’s instant recognition (“You’re Elias’s girl”) leans slightly convenient, though plausible in a tight underworld.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she’s a skeptic who trusts only the examined, yet drawn to the inexplicable. Her glow, metallic taste, and inherited compass reveal layered identity under pressure. The final tightening—her grip on the ring as trees migrate—shows renunciation of isolation for connection, with visible cost in vulnerability. However, the man remains underdeveloped; his storm-making lacks reciprocal emotional stakes, weakening relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—charcoal-stained fingers, knees popping—and his mnemonic gift informs his obsession without veering into diagnostic label-speak. His motivation (to “rectify what had been broken”) emerges organically from suppressed creativity and the call of the laughter, compelling higher-stakes action. The final choice to open the lock feels earned by prior causality, with the cost being the surrender of isolation for communion. However, the internal contradiction between artistic solitude and longing for connection isn’t dramatized as simultaneous tension but rather sequential yearning, slightly softening the psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and particular—her trembling hands after refusing to forge, her smudged ink while piecing the map—and her moral flaw (“wilts near dishonesty”) directly informs her choices. Her motivation grows organically from professional integrity and personal curiosity, culminating in a credible act of pursuit. However, the final descent lacks a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values; she follows the map without hesitation, missing a moment of internal friction that would earn full closure. The absence of such a beat prevents this from reaching 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving wonder through sound and color—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (adjusting the sculpture, pocketing the orb) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His seasonal muteness isn’t just stated but shapes his urgency and method. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through sensory engagement (“cold bit into his fingers,” “breath curling into twilight”). The final renunciation—accepting his own voice’s loss while trusting the bells to carry meaning—is earned by prior causality and charged with opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli’s interiority is vividly embodied—static as memory, fears as physical vials—and his contradictory impulses (caretaker vs. self-liberator) act simultaneously in the climax. His final choice to burn the box is earned through decades of containment, with visible cost: the loss of his curated past and sanctuary. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“fingers brushing the strangely organic soil”). The obsolescence vial’s spin accelerating in his hand crystallizes his arc without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her listening is embodied, not performative. Her restraint in not opening the locket reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Clara’s trembling hands and red eyes convey grief without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (not intervening) is earned by prior micro-choices and consistent with her character.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile relationship with the journal, dice, and structure reveals a psyche shaped by secrecy and control. Her micro-choices (rolling dice, opening the hatch) stem credibly from her core conflict: encrypting vulnerability as strength. Kael functions more as spectral catalyst than full character, but his dance conveys necessary pressure without over-explaining. The final act of stepping into the chamber earns its weight through consistent emotional logic and visible cost: she abandons the sinking lab to claim a truth that may consume her.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlowe’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, crumbling wildflowers, swirling coffee grounds—and his contradictory impulses (to forget vs. to remember) drive micro-choices that escalate to the final step into the chamber. His emotional state degrades credibly under pressure, and his flawed belief that memories are gone is corrected only through dramatized discovery. The journal and flowers aren’t just tokens; they force decisions with visible cost. His motivation is consistent, deeply personal, and culminates in a Charged Poise that forecloses passive grief.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile engagement with earth, paper, and water conveys emotion without diagnostic labels. His motivation (to hush a prophecy) evolves credibly into renunciation, and his final choice to release the crane’s wing carries quiet cost: solitude becomes chosen, not imposed. However, internal contradiction remains muted; the shift from obsession to peace lacks a visible struggle or misstep that would deepen flaw-driven causality. The absence of another character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is otherwise masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her grief, loyalty, and hesitation feel lived-in. Mira’s revelation lands with credible emotional weight, and their dynamic shifts meaningfully. The flaw: Veyra’s absence limits full relationship crucible development, though his influence permeates choices. Final renunciation of secrecy feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., showing the seal).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“hairs on his arms stand on end,” “throat tightened”) and micro-choices (pressing the shell, tracing resonance structures). His “charmed skeptic” stance fuels credible resistance to belief until the garden’s hum forces reevaluation. The final declaration—“I’m not afraid anymore”—feels earned by accumulated emotional pressure rather than sudden epiphany. However, Liora’s ghostly resolve lacks reciprocal contradiction or friction; she functions more as symbolic catalyst than fully pressurized second character.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, shallow breath, and micro-choice to press the thorn into the key reveal layered contradictions: vengeance vs. forgiveness, loyalty vs. survival. Her final renunciation (“to forgive the unfinished”) feels earned by years of forged silence, not declared. Vey’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character into archetype. The only slight flaw: her emotional shift at climax leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“I’m here to forgive…”) rather than purely visceral realization.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her clutching of the shell, perception of vibrations, and emotional restraint feel specific and consistent. Her motivation to understand echoes stems from lived experience, not abstraction. The final choice to sing with Veyan emerges credibly from her established devotion to lost voices. However, her internal contradiction (desire to recover vs. fear of what might return) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her belief in “windows of connection” drives her actions, and her final renunciation (“She would never tell”) is earned through prior causality. Her flaw (the need to expose truth) directly leads to the revelation that forces her silence. The red-coated woman’s appearance triggers no diagnostic self-awareness; emotion remains embodied in breath, touch, and ritual. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ren’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his philosophy emerges through tactile work, not exposition. Mei’s presence deepens his emotional stakes without flattening her into a foil; her agency in seeking him out reframes his solitude as choice, not isolation. The final “Stay” carries quiet weight because it contradicts his established preference for solitude, revealing a shift earned by mutual recognition. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation as a truth-seeker is consistent and intensifies under pressure, and his micro-choices—like reassembling the letters—reveal a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied (“fingers numb from the cold,” “pulse quickened”). However, his shift from suspicion to trust in the stranger lacks sufficient friction or contradictory impulse in the moment, slightly undercutting the credibility of his final stance. The stranger’s exhaustion reads more as archetype than individual, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and envy, with micro-choices (pressing hands to glass, descending the mountain) revealing his hierarchy of values. His contradiction—craving connection yet trusting only whispers—fuels credible escalation. However, his shift from isolation to public confrontation lacks a visible internal pivot; the radio’s voice alone feels insufficient to motivate such a decisive act without deeper prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his ink-stained fingers, hollowed chest, and breath-held hope reveal a man shaped by rejection yet driven by fragile purpose. His micro-choices (winding the box, sealing jars, showing them to the girl) consistently align with his desire to preserve echoes. The final reconfiguration feels earned: he shifts from self-perceived irrelevance to quiet custodianship without epiphanic overstatement. No diagnostic label-speak mars his emotional arc; his contradictions—yearning for connection yet retreating beneath dunes—are lived, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between duty and guilt—is embodied through tactile detail (cold key, resonator dials) and credible micro-choices (lunging for the key despite risk). His final act of touching the artifact feels earned by his established history and moral stance. The scavenger, though present, functions more as pressure than fully realized foil, slightly limiting relational depth. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his mapping, waiting, and sculpting metaphors reveal a man shaped by landscape and time. His final choice to join the stranger feels earned through accumulated micro-decisions (kneeling on ice, not reaching for his knife). However, the stranger remains underdeveloped, limiting relational crucible depth. The story leans heavily on Elias’s internal state without sufficient external friction to test his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—breaking free from Voss’s corrupt system—is rooted in consistent traits (observant, principled) and intensifies credibly under pressure. His internal conflict between fear and duty manifests through embodied reactions (trembling hands, deliberate steps) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. The lantern’s ancestral weight and his grandmother’s voice deepen his moral compass without over-explaining. Final renunciation of passivity is earned by prior causality: his empirical pattern recognition leads directly to decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—guilt as a “weight pressing against his ribs,” the clockwork heart as “a metronome for guilt”—and his moral crisis unfolds through concrete perception, not abstraction. His final choice (“To prove it”) emerges credibly from prior doubt and error, with clear cost: the shattering of his vocational certainty. Kael’s minimal presence sharpens focus on Elias’s solitary reckoning without diluting pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution; the contradiction between his role as dispenser of absolution and agent of irreversible injustice drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—ringing a bell no one hears—is compellingly rooted in generational defiance and personal loss, with embodied contradictions (e.g., calling it “not about sound” while tasting copper). His micro-choices (using the arrow tip as tool/talisman) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Veyra functions effectively as secondary pressure without overcomplicating choreography. The final smile earns its poise through prior causality and visible cost: workshop dying, parents’ legacy, acid-burned fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s motivation is credibly rooted in personal disillusionment and professional obsession, with micro-choices (hiding the patch, copying the video) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through embodied focus (“fingers hovering,” “pulse pounded”). However, her emotional arc leans slightly on archetype—idealistic tech worker turned truth-seeker—without deeper idiosyncrasy. The final choice feels earned but lacks a distinctive flaw that complicates it beyond competence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—“to map empathy onto action”—is credibly rooted in his history and intuition, and his calm courage under pressure feels consistent. His internal contradiction (peacekeeper who saves others but not himself) informs key choices, especially the final throw of the crystal. However, the phrase “calmly intuitive” borders on label-speak without sufficient micro-behavioral proof beyond repeated assertion. The child’s reflection serves more as plot device than relational crucible, limiting emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his tourist detachment wars with visceral empathy, embodied in his thinning skin and loosened grip on reality. His micro-choice to give the parasol tip reveals a hierarchy of values: connection over possession. The man’s reciprocal gesture deepens Elias’s shift without over-explaining. Final renunciation of tourism for service feels earned through tactile, emotional causality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her calloused hands, the letter’s ashes clinging to her skin—and her contradictory impulses (longing vs. wariness) operate simultaneously in scene. Elias’s presence forces a micro-choice (offering the letter) that reveals her hierarchy of values. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; her admission “You hurt me” carries raw, unvarnished cost. However, Elias’s motivation leans slightly on declarative dialogue rather than fully dramatized prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line walker’s honesty is embodied through micro-choices—refusing to look directly at the prophet, speaking plainly despite fear—and creates visible tension with his role. His internal contradiction (desire to understand vs. fear of inadequacy) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final realization feels earned because it emerges from tactile engagement with the thread, not abstract epiphany. Flawed yet consistent, he reads as an individual shaped by worldview, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his calmness, archival obsession, and emotional restraint feel lived-in. His motivation to honor workers through visual narrative is rooted in personal healing, not abstraction. The final realization—that the act of creation is itself the masterpiece—is earned by his prior choices and quiet attention. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; it unfolds as a linear epiphany rather than a tension between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence is consistently embodied through tactile reverence for books and precise micro-choices (whispering, humming, pressing crystal to temple). His motivation—decoding growth patterns—is credibly rooted in scholarly obsession, not exposition. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see devotion but not the struggle between isolation and testimony. The final realization feels earned, though the cost of his solitude isn’t viscerally rendered beyond atmospheric melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The junkyard prophet’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his desperate need to remember warring with his precognitive forgetfulness—and his micro-choices (kneeling, drawing, placing driftwood) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The woman’s appearance crystallizes relational stakes without over-explaining, and the final act of stepping forward carries the cost of cyclical recurrence. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion stays tactile (“breath hitched,” “fingers clumsy with urgency”). His flaw actively complicates resolution, making endurance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—“to harness the ephemeral”—is viscerally embodied through trembling fingers, breath fogging glass, and tactile engagement with tools. His internal contradiction (obsession vs. mortality) intensifies under pressure without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of the observatory for the photograph reads as earned endurance with visible cost: he loses his station but secures proof. However, his backstory lacks anchoring micro-choices that tilt present action beyond the leaf-fall epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his tactile connection to the vinyl shard, his “decisively kind” movements, and his quiet grief all reveal character without therapy-speak. Lena’s agency in requesting a specific song and gifting her shard demonstrates mutual history and stakes. Their relationship functions as a crucible: the shared ritual of music crystallizes their final bond. The only limitation is slight flattening in Lena’s voice—her dialogue borders on aphoristic, risking thematic echo over idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation is rooted in a lifelong obsession with shadows, embodied through tactile interactions with runes, the key, and the observatory. Her internal conflict—between scholarly caution and desperate curiosity—manifests in micro-choices (e.g., turning the key despite fear). The final act of “closing the loop” is earned by her prior study and emotional investment, with visible cost: reclaiming lost parts of herself. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through fogged glass, tightened fingers, and wavering lantern light.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s contradictory nature—skeptic yet believer, passive observer turned active seeker—is embodied in precise micro-choices (keeping the tooth, kneeling in soil, whispering unintelligible words) that escalate under pressure. Her motivation (“to turn mistakes into constellations”) is dramatized through tactile ritual and emotional restraint, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to take the child’s hand feels earned by her consistent willingness to dwell in uncertainty. Cost is legible: she trades communal truth for private redemption, a renunciation with quiet but felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—sharing light without fire—is grounded in specific loss (her father, failed lanterns) and embodied through tactile memory (polishing dust on skin). Her internal conflict between eagerness and caution manifests physically (kneeling, wading deeper) and culminates in a credible renunciation of forced brightness. The final choice—to reflect rather than burn—is earned by prior failure and grief, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Mira’s interiority is rendered with precise, embodied contradiction—Elias watches to understand, not judge; Mira’s quiet proactivity masks guilt and yearning. Their micro-choices (leaving honey, tracing icicle patterns) reveal hierarchies of value with visible emotional cost. The final handclasp and pendant offering crystallize a reconfigured relationship without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, clutching the seashell, and his admission “I didn’t know how” reveal layered conflict between creative longing and self-doubt. His micro-choices (wading deeper, turning back) align with his trait of moving “against the current,” showing consistent motivation. The protagonist’s hollow-eyed double crystallizes his failure to fully imagine his own character, making the internal struggle tangible. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s whimsical tinkerer identity is vividly embodied through tactile details (clockwork beetles, silver flute) and consistent interiority. Her motivation—to restore sacred practices—is rooted in personal history and social alienation, intensifying credibly at the climax. The tendril interaction reveals contradictory impulses: longing for connection vs. fear of being dismissed as delusional. Final choice to return and sing is earned, with visible cost in her prior isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve the pause between heartbeats—is rooted in a lifetime of fleeting, ash-like moments, making his final act of sealing starlight feel inevitable. His interiority is concrete (“calloused from years of folding and igniting”) and emotionally specific, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The contradiction between his destructive craft (flash-paper) and preservationist yearning animates every gesture. His micro-choices—arranging detritus, folding paper with spiderlike precision—reveal a hierarchy of values where stillness outweighs spectacle, paid for in lifelong transience.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s peripherally focused trait shapes his perception and choices throughout, especially in how he studies light and handles the timer. His motivation to capture “echoes” is embodied through tactile actions—tracing gears, prying with quartz—not abstract longing. The younger self’s appearance triggers a credible emotional reversal that reconfigures his understanding without sentimentality. Final renunciation (“letting go”) is earned by prior obsession and carries conceptual cost: stored wonder is relinquished for trust in return.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her burdens manifest as tactile, sensory objects, and her micro-choices (orienting toward the north wall, exhaling slowly) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to understand rather than discard burdens feels consistent and deepens credibly. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensation. The final renunciation is earned: she endures the weight to achieve understanding, not catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her grief is not summarized but lived through tactile hesitation, ritual, and the fraught act of carving. Her micro-choices (letting the kettle scream, delaying the first cut) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. The final renunciation isn’t of grief but of the need to “harvest lessons,” an earned shift grounded in prior behavior. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, not therapy-inflected narration.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scavenger’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret, erosion, and hesitation manifest through tactile details (warm camera wheel, damp mist) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choice to kneel and touch the lagoon crystallizes her internal conflict without tidy resolution. The ghost confrontation reveals contradictory impulses: longing for absolution versus fear of judgment. Final renunciation (“let the wind carry the weight away”) feels earned by prior emotional buildup and carries visible cost—she relinquishes the last relic of a lost self.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “functionally creative” mindset manifests in how she reads patterns in decay and water flow. Her micro-choices (pocketing the sextant, sketching the greenhouse) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over protocol, resilience over ruin. The woman’s brief but sharp presence exerts immediate pressure that crystallizes Mara’s arc without over-explaining. Flaws are integrated (her tendency to seek equations borders on abstraction), but her emotional progression feels earned, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his avoidance of the forecourt, tactile memory of his mother winding the music box, and trembling hesitation before following the bear reveal layered contradiction without therapy-speak. His final choice to follow the bear and kneel at the quartz stones is earned by micro-choices (letting the girl sleep, repairing the box) that reconfigure his relationship to grief. The girl functions as effective secondary pressure, though her role borders on instrumental. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression feels irrational yet credible.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The legend seeker’s internal conflict—between obsessive pursuit and the dawning realization that truth resides within—is embodied through tactile choices (handling the sundial, prying open the crate) and perceptual shifts. His flaw (chasing external validation of truth) directly motivates his actions and culminates in a resonant self-recognition. The final renunciation of external seeking is earned by prior causality, with the cost being years wasted on shadows. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensation and object interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation as a philosophical seed collector is vividly rendered through tactile engagement with the rope and fulgurite, grounding abstract purpose in sensory detail. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing patience and reverence through micro-choices—tracing knots, kneeling in snow—that align with his mission. The story skirts emotional summarization by embodying his obsession in action, though internal contradiction remains muted; his flaw is near-absence of doubt rather than struggle. This near-flawlessness slightly limits depth but doesn’t undermine credibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, vocation, and moral burden manifest in tactile detail (e.g., “fingers brushing the palace carpet weft thread”). Her motivation—to stitch absence into coherence through writing—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final act of planting the thread reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, presence over erasure. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; her resolve feels singular rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kaelen’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is embodied through his trembling hands, tattered cloak, and obsessive tinkering. His internal conflict (mechanical control vs. emotional surrender) manifests physically in failed attempts and culminates in the earned renunciation of machinery for song. The final whispering choice reveals a hierarchy of values: authenticity over precision, memory over mechanism. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through cracked glass, humming off-key, and damp wings.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—calloused hands in black sand, the warm coin against her skin—and her contradictory impulses (fire as destroyer vs. healer) act simultaneously. Her micro-choices (touching the coin, sifting sand, inviting the girl) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. The child’s presence crystallizes her stance without resolving her past, preserving moral ambiguity. However, the father’s characterization leans slightly toward archetype, limiting full contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her skepticism warring with longing—and her micro-choices (e.g., prying open the box, stepping into the dark) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The grandmother apparition functions as a crucible, forcing Elara to confront avoidance masked as caution. Flaws feel lived-in, not diagnostic, and the final descent earns its emotional weight without tidy resolution. However, the apparition’s dialogue edges toward thematic exposition, slightly softening the rawness of Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—breaking generational cycles by sharing light without fire—is deeply rooted in lived trauma and consistently embodied through tactile interaction with the gear and nebula. His internal contradiction (sentimentality vs. resolve) manifests in trembling hands and deliberate action, not summary. Kael’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character; their dialogue reveals inherited rage versus earned wisdom. The final renunciation (“passing it on”) carries visible emotional cost and forecloses violence, fulfilling Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his grief manifests through tactile rituals (carving, unspooling ribbon) rather than abstract labels. His micro-choices (returning nightly, draping the ribbon) reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring memory over isolation. However, his transformation leans slightly on epiphanic clarity (“grief is a bridge”) without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene. The final renunciation of solitude feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied guilt and micro-choices—kneeling, brushing sand, pressing names into brass—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His contradictions (devotion to balance vs. buried shame) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The rake handle inscriptions ground abstract regret in tactile history, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation—tossing the smoothed handle—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—discovering “the shape of intentions”—is rooted in quiet longing, not morbidity, and his blithe exterior contrasts with the emotional weight he absorbs. His micro-choices (humming while tracing names, planting roses) reveal a hierarchy of values: care over closure, listening over solving. The final realization—that he, too, longs to hear the dead—feels earned, not epiphanic, because it emerges from tactile engagement with objects and space. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in soil, thread, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as an ignorance cartographer, with micro-choices (e.g., hesitating before writing) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict—between skepticism and hope—is embodied rather than summarized, though the lack of interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth. The final act feels earned through prior causality, with the cost being the surrender of control over the future she writes. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatlining mars her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—teaching dust to speak—is vividly embodied and consistent, rooted in his role as a copyist of unheard music. His internal contradiction (faith in silence vs. hunger for voice) manifests through micro-choices: tuning the radio, gathering dust, humming the song. The final act—laughing at the word “Listen”—shows earned emotional progression without therapy-speak. However, his flaw lacks tangible complication; his success arrives smoothly, with minimal struggle against self or circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his trembling hands, breath in cold air, and tactile engagement with ash and pigment reveal a man haunted by filial duty and artistic failure. His motivation (to complete his mother’s portrait) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in the earned renunciation of that goal. The final act—scattering ashes onto the portrait—is micro-choiced with visible cost: he accepts his own face as the unresolved truth. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (love vs. resentment, pursuit vs. surrender) pulse beneath every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his rationally rebellious nature and obsession with truth, driving every action from sewer-dwelling to deciphering sediment layers. His internal conflict—between scholarly rigor and moral outrage—is embodied through tactile details (ink-stained fingers, grime-blackened hands) rather than abstract introspection. The final decision to surface feels earned, not impulsive, as it emerges from days of obsessive labor and mounting realization of societal indifference. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miss Voss’s “expectantly resigned” posture and quiet agency are embodied with restraint, and her micro-choices—introducing the zither, ignoring Maren’s scoff—reveal a hierarchy of values. Secondary characters like Maren and Liora shift believably through gesture (brushing hands) rather than exposition. However, the choir members remain lightly sketched; their transformation leans on implication over individualized contradiction. The final renunciation—teaching listening, not singing—is earned, though the cost (years of isolation?) is felt more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her sensory gift and trauma, and her actions—pruning, planting, eating the fruit—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on healing over possession. Her internal conflict between longing and agency manifests physically (trembling hands, breath held) rather than through diagnostic self-talk. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her choice to distribute seeds embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forgoes personal restoration for communal possibility. One flaw: the memory-vision lacks contradictory impulses—she experiences wholeness without resistance, slightly flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s involuntary truthfulness and desire to preserve wonder are concretely embodied in micro-choices (hesitating to lie, opening the box) and deepen under pressure. His internal contradiction—duty vs. secrecy—is active in-scene, not summarized. Maren’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening Elias’s agency. The final act of striking the match feels earned by his established traits and carries the cost of trespassing a sacred boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—understanding why houses feel alive—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and deepens into a credible endurance at the climax. His micro-choice to insert the orris root shard reveals a hierarchy of values (curiosity over safety) with visible cost: he inadvertently pauses a living house, confronting his own limits. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using sensory perception (“skin prickle,” “pulse loud”) to convey unease. The final renunciation—walking away without looking back—is earned by prior causality and forecloses resolution with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The diver’s internal conflict—between certainty and nuance—is embodied in her hesitation and ultimate choice, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation (recovering truth) intensifies into a morally fraught act with visible cost: unleashing what was contained. The statue functions less as a full character and more as a thematic conduit, slightly limiting relational depth, but the diver’s arc is coherent, flawed, and culminates in a credible renunciation of absolutes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular—his grim optimism manifests through tactile choices (handling the dice, stepping upward) rather than abstract labels. His motivation (“capture the texture of a missed opportunity”) emerges from consistent traits and intensifies under pressure. The chipped die functions as both object and psychological extension, revealing his belief in controlled chaos. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from seeking rupture to accepting change lacks a visible internal struggle that would fully earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, smudged ink, and breath-fogged glass reveal exhaustion and hope without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (dipping the brush, rolling paintings for strangers) manifest a hierarchy of values: memory over sleep, kindness over anonymity. The final renunciation of despair is earned through sustained pressure from the smog-choked world versus her greenhouse sanctuary. No emotional flatness or unearned epiphany mars her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—rooted in personal loss and cultural preservation—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (kneading dough, tracing threads). Her internal contradiction (remembering shape but not weight) crystallizes in the bakery scene, where micro-choices reveal her hierarchy of values. The baker serves as effective secondary pressure without overcomplicating choreography. However, the final choice lacks a visible *foreclosed* path; revival feels granted rather than earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—stepping beyond fate through time-defying mechanics—is rooted in his identity as a counter-clockwise clockmaker and deepened by tactile engagement with the yoyo and hunger stone. His internal contradiction (desire for control vs. surrender to latent radiance) manifests in embodied choices: winding, dropping, catching. The final renunciation of linear time is earned through prior micro-choices and carries the cost of irreversible transformation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fear manifests through physical reactions and micro-choices (e.g., pressing his palm to the mirror). His contradiction—desiring self-reclamation while fearing hollowness—is dramatized in real time. The whispering advisor functions more as a psychological projection than a second character, preserving single-POV integrity. Final renunciation of the cloak feels earned, though the advisor’s role slightly blurs motivation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leeward’s interiority is vividly embodied—his salt-veined perception, tactile connection to driftwood, and synesthetic reading of clouds feel character-specific. His motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) manifests through micro-choices: dubbing instead of striking, listening with his feet. The final laugh and raised mallet show earned transformation without epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (stubbornness vs. collaboration) pulse in action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in cartographic obsession and defiance of communal fear—drives every action with visceral consistency. Her interiority is embodied through tactile details (satchel weight, shell warmth) rather than diagnostic labels. The final sprint reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, movement over stasis. Her flaw—relentless curiosity—directly enables the climax and its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s “emotionally rational” contradiction is embodied in his tactile caution and moral calculus; Liora functions as a crucible who sharpens his dilemma without caricature. Their final alignment feels earned because both characters operate from coherent, opposing epistemologies rooted in professional identity. The micro-choice to hand over the letter—not destroy or hide it—reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sacrificing archival purity for communal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in micro-choices—kneeling in cold water, pressing bricks back—that reveal his hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels. His internal contradiction (desire to preserve vs. acceptance of loss) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“love lets us let go”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No safety-hedging; his flaw (emotional burden of memory) directly enables his function as “keeper of echoes.”

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—tracing honest origins—is rooted in consistent professional identity and personal obsession, intensifying credibly as the ledger reveals his lineage. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through tactile engagement with books, water, and the stamp. The final choice to stay is earned by prior causality: his life indexing the past now reconfigures into stewardship of inheritance. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the surface world, crystallized without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s motivation—grief transmuted through dream-lanterns—is consistent, embodied in soot-stained fingers and origami cranes, and intensifies to a credible breaking point. Her internal contradiction (desire for truth vs. fear of being consumed) manifests in micro-choices: ignoring priests, selecting specific dreams, polishing with moonstone. The final surrender to the dream-serpent feels earned, not passive, as it emerges from her pattern of compulsive shaping. However, the brother’s presence remains abstract, slightly weakening the emotional specificity of her core wound.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motivation is rooted in visceral, embodied grief—her charred wedding dress, the drone’s lingering hum—and her micro-choices (clutching the geode, stepping toward the apparition) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. Internal contradiction simmers beneath her resolve: she hunts but seeks answers; she’s hardened yet responds to the scientist’s echo. The final run isn’t just escape—it’s recommitment to a path foreclosed by fire, with cost etched into her second skin. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority; emotion emerges through tactile memory and action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between detached professionalism and a buried yearning for belonging—is rendered through embodied choices (hands shaking, powering down the drone) rather than exposition. The pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” trait borders on archetype but is redeemed by her active role in triggering the climax. Motivation intensifies credibly: his habitual data-retrieval past gives way to personal investment when the chip pulses in sync with his own longing. Final nod toward departure feels earned, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, moral ambiguity, and contradictory impulses—helping others bury truth while seeking his own—are rendered with concrete embodiment (trembling hands, broken watch) and consistent interiority. His final act of breaking the hour hand earns a credible renunciation with visible cost. The uncle’s pressure forces a meaningful shift without melodrama. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the psychological realism.

    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his breath, fingers on the drawer pull, imagined untethering—all revealing a man burdened by legacy and duty. His motivation (“recycle mistakes into wisdom”) is consistent and deepened through micro-choices: arriving early, trusting Seris despite wariness, accepting silence over resolution. The final renunciation of escape (“Some mistakes were recycled into wisdom”) feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost carried in pocketed objects. Seris is lean but functional—her “thoughtful” trait manifests in precise dialogue and moon-phase locket, avoiding stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between filial duty and selfhood—is rendered through embodied contradictions: adjusting his life vest while clutching a useless astronomical compass, laughing through sobs. His micro-choice to hurl the compass crystallizes a hierarchy of values with tangible cost (abandoning paternal legacy). Motivation is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies believably; however, the final renunciation leans slightly toward epiphany over incremental struggle, softening the flaw-complication dynamic just enough to deny a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grip on the baseball, his aversion to Mara’s hand—and his contradictions (jaded yet seeking, detached yet haunted) operate simultaneously. His micro-choices (left tunnel, silence, refusal to look away in the mirror chamber) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The flaw: his shift toward empathy feels slightly telegraphed by the time-traveler’s note rather than fully earned through present-moment struggle. Still, his renunciation of forgetting is credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands contrast her “paradoxically steady” gift, and her micro-choices (crumpling then saving the fortune, pressing forehead to phoenix breast) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The metamorphosis scene crystallizes her acceptance of love’s transformation, not its restoration. Her flaw—clinging to memory—is confronted through action, not exposition. Final renunciation (“that was enough”) feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling fingers, ink-bleeding confession, and alignment with her younger self’s handprint reveal layered grief without diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to find where lost time accumulates—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (tracing the crack, pressing palm to cloth). The final endurance (“she did not flinch”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of irretrievable loss. Contradictory impulses (seeking vs. accepting) act simultaneously in scene, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s pacifism is embodied, not declared—her needle-stitching of grief into the ship’s skin reveals a hierarchy of values where mercy demands unbearable cost. Her internal contradiction (duty vs. despair) acts simultaneously in scene, especially when her hands don’t shake before the soldier’s accusation. The final renunciation—letting the ship dissolve while she floats empty-handed—is earned by every prior suture. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile ritual and gravitational unmooring.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his destitution versus generosity, disbelief in fate versus orchestration of kindness. His micro-choices (running to warn the village) feel earned by prior causality. The woman’s appearance risks archetype but functions as catalyst without over-explaining. Final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost: he becomes necessary, not just generous.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her role as lock sentinel informs her meticulous, inventive actions under pressure. Her interiority is embodied (“pulse a quiet drum in her throat,” “breath steady”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice—to ignite revolution via signal rather than confrontation—is earned by prior knowledge of the fort’s mechanics and social dynamics. Minor deduction: the aide’s presence doesn’t deepen Mira’s internal conflict beyond situational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in ancestral duty and sensory isolation—is consistent and embodied through tactile detail (eels, star dust, rocks). His precognitive curse informs perception without over-explaining, and his final act feels earned by lifelong observation. The weight of the “promise” shifts from abstract burden to concrete responsibility through micro-choices (placing rocks, releasing dust). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises via physical friction returning.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his tracing of the brass railing, his grip warming the timer—and his contradictory impulses (to understand vs. to endure) coexist without resolution. His micro-choices (stealing the timer, coming to the observatory) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on witnessing silenced histories. The final renunciation—not deciphering but carrying the map—is earned by his prior acts of attention and theft. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and withheld action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias and Isolde’s motivations are deeply interwoven with their history and the duel’s intellectual stakes. Their contradictory impulses—Elias’s desire for connection masked as competition, Isolde’s precision masking vulnerability—are embodied in micro-choices like adjusting the sundial or trembling with the needle card. The mechanical arm functions not as a prop but as a lived extension of identity, grounding his “diplomatically fierce” trait in physical consequence. Their final exchange reveals earned emotional risk without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lumen’s contradictory impulses—desire for identity versus fear of permanence—are embodied in tactile detail (“fingers tracing the coffee tin,” “forgetting the name they’d given themselves”) and culminate in a credible renunciation of molting. His micro-choices (opening the tin, sorting books) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: stability over evasion. Elias functions as both crucible and mirror, his reappearance forcing Lumen to confront years of avoidance without melodrama. The final line—“I’m not anything yet”—resists epiphany while signaling earned vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests through tactile rituals (winding the clock, playing specific scales) and contradictory impulses (strategic creativity vs. emotional paralysis). His final choice feels earned: not a cure for grief, but a reconfiguration of its weight. The “strategically creative” trait directly enables his climactic act without over-explaining. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “throwing himself off a cliff” metaphor, though it’s swiftly grounded by physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior conflict—between duty and fear of destabilizing truth—is rendered through embodied hesitation (“fingers brushing a petal,” “clenched fist”) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her transformation from avoidance to resolve feels earned, though the final decision lacks a visible interpersonal cost beyond internal resolve. Nani functions effectively as pressure but doesn’t alter relational dynamics beyond exposition. The empirically whimsical dreams are noted but don’t actively complicate choices in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s slow-spoken nature, tremors, and tactile engagement with objects reveal a deeply embodied interiority. His motivation—to find “the color of unspoken apologies”—is consistent, emotionally specific, and tied to tangible regret rather than abstraction. The micro-choice to mend rather than prune crystallizes his arc with visible cost: he accepts the past cannot be undone but can be diffused. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action (brushing sand, aligning compass, weaving thread).
