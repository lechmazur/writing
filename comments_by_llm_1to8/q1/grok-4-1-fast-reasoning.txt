    Elara's motivation ("to discover purpose in the pauses") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "steadily adaptive" trait functions as a label applied repeatedly without visible trade-offs or genuine struggle; she succeeds at every turn without foreclosing options or paying embodied costs. Internal experience remains abstract—"her will reshaping like cooling glass"—and emotional states are summarized rather than shown through contradictory action. The survival choice at the end feels inevitable rather than earned by prior vulnerability or error.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation (translating silence into music) is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic moment with Kai shows some embodied work—kneeling, mapping turmoil up close—but the emotional arc remains abstract: "scarlet spikes piercing blue regret" reads as label-only cartography rather than lived contradiction. Internal conflict is told through heat-map metaphors instead of dramatized in micro-choices with visible cost. The final image offers no renunciation or foreclosed path; Elara departs "transformed" by declaration, smiling in generic triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (granting the dead permanent rest) is clear and his weariness embodied through decades of burial work. His "inadvertently stubborn" trait drives the lens-repair sequence, though the final transformation feels more thematic necessity than earned character choice—the cost of merging with the lens reads as cosmically inevitable rather than a deliberate trade-off with visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on descriptive summary ("his eyes heavy with the weight of countless burials") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No second on-page character to test relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and her gently persistent approach shapes several beats, but her interior life remains largely abstract—we see her "motivation burned softly" and her "eyes kind but unyielding" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The community's shift from resistance to ritual follows her urging rather than emerging from Mira's own visible struggle or blind spot. Lena's orphan backstory and her "thrill cementing loyalty" gesture toward depth but read as told rather than dramatized through body and micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's spiritual curiosity is asserted but his micro-choices under pressure feel pre-determined by the pilgrim-of-sparks framework rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The healing moment arrives through camera-obscura mechanics without visible internal trade-off or foreclosed path on Elias's part—he guides Mira but pays no legible cost. Mira's wound-healing reads as passive receipt rather than embodied choice. The final realization ("unused love… stored in these connections") lands as epiphany-by-narration rather than earned shift from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time" is articulated early but remains abstract throughout; his gestures with the halo fragment and photographs never translate into micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on decorative reverie ("quaking," "trembling") rather than embodied contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final liberation reads as declared rather than earned—no prior constraint meaningfully narrows his options on the page, and the cost of freedom (loss of wife's image, fragment destruction) arrives without prior struggle over that specific tradeoff. Backstory loops (wife, first mazes) anchor in present stimuli but do not tilt present stance via on-page micro-choices; they function as atmospheric color rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined almost entirely by label: "patiently strategic," "staggering grace," "chained liberator." These descriptors recur throughout but never manifest as contradictory impulses or genuine flaws that complicate her choices. Her motivations (smuggling seeds to exiles) are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The piece grants her competence without visible struggle—she decodes the piano cipher, escapes chains, and navigates combat with fluid ease, never making a mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation (capturing betrayal's sound) is established early, but his choices feel largely predetermined by his attribute and profession rather than arising from genuine internal conflict. The interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("colors sang louder," "memories' impact crystallized") rather than embodied contradiction. The regeneration mechanic provides a time constraint but doesn't create meaningful tension between competing impulses—he simply works through the process. The final moment of donning the device and achieving catharsis reads as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses something with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to press her ear against destiny's door") but remains abstract through most of the piece. Her interiority leans heavily on stock metaphor ("heart raced," "disbelief flickered luminous") and diagnostic phrasing without embodied contradiction. The pivot from thief to "wielder" at closure is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a prior path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to create "safe zones" is declared but never tested by competing desires or realistic friction. His transformation from nomadic isolation to communal yearning is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interiority relies on abstract labels ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness") rather than embodied emotion, and key moments like his vow to "abandon the wild" lack visible cost that forecloses a path. No on-page choice forces a trade-off between solitude and sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's phobia-ridden nature is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she simply performs stunts despite terror, making her fears ornamental rather than motivating. The betrayal revelation arrives as exposition dump at the gala rather than through dramatized discovery. The ending's physical confrontation ("shoving him toward the cliff") lacks earned buildup and reads as convenient violence rather than a choice rooted in prior interiority. Multiple self-corrections mid-narrative ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit") expose scaffolding that should have been removed.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The oracle's "mild obsession" to map endless night is stated but never tested; we see no contradictory impulse or struggle when Elara's need interrupts his work. Elara's desperation is asserted ("eyes wide with desperation") rather than shown through embodied perception or micro-choices under pressure. The oracle's action—teaching Elara to read silence—proceeds without friction or cost to his own goal. No decision forecloses a path with visible consequence; both characters end in alignment without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    The robot protagonist pursues a clear motivation but remains largely observational. The "remarkably composed" trait appears as a repeated label without constraining choices under pressure. Micro-choices (lifting the violin, playing it, setting it down) advance the loop structure but carry no visible stakes or cost; the revelation about thought-origin arrives via passive absorption rather than through decisions that foreclose paths. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle are absent—the janitor processes data streams without genuine conflict between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's interiority is label-heavy ("his motivation burned steady") rather than embodied, and Mira's arc from mistrust to transparency is told through external symbols (tickets, lens) without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The text asserts her "dawning realization" and thaw via reported crystals whispers rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. The final embrace is declared complete ("mistrust melted") without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page, reading as symbolic closure rather than earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's pragmatism is shown through concrete actions—shears, patience, ritual—but his interior life remains thin; we see what he does more than the contradictory impulses driving him. The final choice to continue polishing feels inevitable from his established pattern rather than a fraught decision with visible cost. The council auditors are functionally present but lack distinct voices or pressures beyond their scanner readouts. Emotional embodiment is largely absent; Elias never wavers or doubts on the page, flattening the arc into demonstration rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the climactic lever pull, but her interiority reads generic and label-heavy ("mechanically warm touch," "obliging nature"). The supporting cast—Lirren and the xenobiologists—exist only as sketch figures without applying meaningful pressure. No on-page internal contradiction or embodied struggle; the journey from repair work to proof feels externally narrated rather than chosen under duress. Micro-choices in the build lack visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motive to unravel Elara's code is declared but not meaningfully tested through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The climactic choice to slash the lantern and flood the compartment lacks prior interiority that would make the escalation feel inevitable rather than convenient. Interiority relies heavily on label-only constructions ("heart raced," "resolve," "ignited") without character-particular texture. The final renunciation ("lately inspired no more—he was ignited") reads as summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to reckon with the swallowed truth is clear, and her fault-tolerant nature shows in her peripherally aware method. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic labels ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties") rather than concrete embodied thought under pressure. The cartographer's death is revealed as backstory summary rather than a dramatized choice that tests her in real time, weakening the felt cost of her final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jax's motivation is present and rooted (mechanic who caused thirteen deaths), but the final choice—turning the wheel—arrives through psychic-radio revelation rather than dramatic pressure forcing a hierarchy of values. The callback to "swallowed truth" and brother's death earns the weight, yet the confession mechanism (he realizes he'd dialed in anonymously) reads convenient rather than agonized. Interiority often tells ("Years ago, young and desperate") instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (pulse quickens, muscles straining) but is diluted by abstract phrases like "psychic residue" and "feather-light revelation."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The chronicle keeper remains a static observer whose "loose grip on reality" functions as descriptive label rather than a trait that constrains choice under pressure. His descent and arrival at the refuge unfold without internal conflict or competing impulses; the resolution merely fulfills a declared vow rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The spectral figure never makes a difficult choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he follows the swan's method unopposed, and the ending grants him "eternity's truest ledger" without sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation (nurturing lifelong wonder through music therapy) is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The decision to give Lila the locket feels enacted rather than earned through on-page struggle—his internal conflict between holding onto his daughter's memory and helping Lila is told retrospectively, not shown in real-time tension. Lila's shift from silence to speech arrives too smoothly without sufficient resistance or micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The phrase "cautious exuberance" and "softly adaptive" recur as labels rather than embodied states that complicate action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thorne's motivation to collect wall-stories is stated but never tested by conflicting desires or meaningful cost. His "sensitively perceptive" trait is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final image shows him "fulfilled" but no on-page choice forecloses a path—he simply settles into what he was already doing. The diarist predecessor remains a shadow; no relationship pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes ("trapped in this routine…yearned to transpose life into a new key") but his decision to orchestrate the spies' downfall arrives abruptly without visible internal conflict or cost. The pivot from fortune-cookie writer to shadow puppeteer feels convenient rather than earned by contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; his "trembling hands" and "heart pounding a new rhythm" are gestural stock. The final celebration erases any price for his manipulation, flattening what could have been a morally complex turn.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    Father Elias remains a functional archetype rather than a deeply embodied character. Interiority consists of theological abstractions ("illuminate hidden assumptions") without contradictory impulses or visible struggle between competing desires. The motivation to "expose the shadow's hidden assumptions" is stated but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under cost. Emotional states are asserted through labels ("motivation burning clear," "zeal") rather than enacted through somatic detail or difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "conduct unheard symphonies" reads as ornamental rather than a lived desire with contradictory costs. Her "chronologically homesick" state is declared but never constrains an on-page choice—she simply executes her ritual without friction. The ethereal crowd and the boy from her eighth summer materialize without prior grounding, breaking character-bound knowledge. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("chronologically homesick," "motivation surging") instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias's interiority is almost entirely absent; we see him "motivated by the labyrinth of self" but never experience contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final absorption of the shadow-doppelganger lands as a declared solution rather than an earned choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is missing throughout—no sweat, tremor, or hesitation that would ground the high-stakes confrontation. The character reads as a vehicle for the prompt elements rather than a person under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "pierce her numbness" is established, but the interiority remains abstract—"emotional numbness" and "hollow repetition" are label-only rather than embodied contradiction. The mending of the needle and orchestration of the rite show goal-driven action, yet the final shift ("numbness fled, defeated") asserts change without dramatizing the micro-choice or internal friction that earns it. Thorne and the students function as recipients rather than sources of sustained pressure on Elara's core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's observational habits are clearly embodied through physical action (unfastening the tube, splinting the bird), and her lateral thinking process shows character-particular cognition. However, the final "choice" to encode rather than report reads more like habitual recording than a consequential decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority occasionally drifts into label-only terms ("credibly curious," "integrity") without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation to discover "time's texture" is stated repeatedly but never grounded in concrete, character-particular interiority—why this obsession matters to *him* remains abstract. Internal conflict is mostly told ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final "choice" to integrate the rope rather than sever it feels unmotivated; no prior causality establishes why wrapping it around his wrist would solve the binary the beings posed. Embodied emotion is minimal; labels like "passionate subtlety" and "ethically playful" recur without visceral grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lir's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished is clear and shapes the ritual, but his interior contradictions remain thin—he moves through the sequence without visible internal resistance or cost to his own stance. The moment he shares his father's incomplete story ("sword half-drawn...") offers embodied emotion, yet the decision feels pre-determined rather than earned through on-page struggle. Secondary characters (fisherman, girl) apply pressure through their offerings, but Lir's responses are consistent service rather than choices that foreclose paths. The final smile and readiness for tomorrow signal endurance without visible trade-off or renunciation that would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias demonstrates consistent professional detachment through concrete choices (selecting the petal, calibrating notes, channeling the grotto's charge), but his interiority remains abstract—"professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment"—rather than embodied contradiction. Mira's transformation is told through labels ("raw anguish," "luminous stillness") without lived embodiment or micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to subsume her sorrow reads mechanically; no competing impulse acts in scene, and the cost (his own detachment) is asserted rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias and Mira are motivated by a shared compassion cycle, but their interiority relies heavily on labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied contradiction. The locket revelation triggers recognition but not a difficult choice with visible cost—Elias simply marvels and proposes friendship. Backstory dominates the middle third (the wreck, Mira's anonymous donations) and is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's longing to "graft herself onto community" is established early, but her interiority is often abstract ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The group-formation beats are told more than dramatized—we're told they "deciphered" and "bonds tightened," but few micro-choices show her wrestling with vulnerability or cost. The final knotting feels declarative rather than earned by prior on-page struggle. Secondary characters (Lir, Mira, Thorne) apply pressure primarily by existing, not by forcing Elara into trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to illustrate the Echo Cradle is stated but never tested by internal conflict or competing impulse. Her pendant-borrowing and sculpture-solving read as smooth competence without visible struggle, cost, or flawed reasoning that would generate embodied tension. The "illustrator of rhythms" tag arrives conveniently to solve the sculptures without prior dramatization of her observational process under pressure. No micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals contradictory desires.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thorne's motivation (understand emotion's mathematics to reunite with Elowyn) is clear and shapes his peak action—embedding the glass eyes—but his interior remains abstract. The grief is told through high-register metaphor ("ambiguous loss," "grief's indeterminate ache") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. No secondary character appears to test him, and the resolution feels declared rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation is clear and embodied through methodical action, and the tape fragment triggers authentic sense memory that deepens his resolve. However, the woman remains thinly sketched—her genealogy obsession is told rather than shown affecting her choices, and her final embrace feels unearned by prior interaction. The wife's deathbed whisper "Become visible to those who need you" skirts therapy-speak but gains grounding through the concrete tape artifact and Elias's years-long pattern of hidden care.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation—studying plant behaviors—is clear and present, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract justification ("circuitously sincere," "winding justification") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The metamorphosis unfolds as a series of physical stages described externally; internal conflict remains told ("reluctance gnawed") rather than dramatized through simultaneous competing impulses in scene. The final choice lacks visible cost because the transformation completes without any on-page foreclosure of a live option—he simply becomes plant, with no dramatized trade-off or renunciation that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's insomnia and artistic drive are established early, but his micro-choices remain largely observational until the exchange near the end. The meeting with Mira feels convenient rather than earned through prior pressure. Interior contradictions are present ("wryly earnest") but don't sufficiently constrain his actions; the brooch exchange reads more thematic than character-compelled. Embodied emotion is visible in "heart pounding with weary wonder," yet the final shift toward sleep's edge lacks the visible cost of a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thorne's motivation (barren fields) is established but remains static—he is a passive vessel throughout. Elara receives more attention but her arc (resisting → accepting possession) is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The climactic choice "With a resolute breath, she opened herself" arrives without visible struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weary but hopeful," "agony and ecstasy merged") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to compile fragments is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His "reactively visionary" trait operates as a label; visions arrive on cue from spray without cost or constraint shaping his choices. The crowd at the ending receives heartening but remains undifferentiated—no individual responds with agency that tests Elias or forces a micro-choice. Interior life consists of stock archivist gestures (kneeling, pocketing, compiling) without embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His choices feel dictated by the premise rather than earned through visible internal contradiction—he "knows" it's the night, descends without hesitation, and boards the train with only cosmetic trembling. The final moment claims completion ("his journey a perfect loop of analytical art") but offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply returns richer, unshaken. Interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("trembling certainty," "quivering assurance") and the emotional arc resolves into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior skepticism-to-openness arc is signaled but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The fisherman and other visitors remain one-note conduits for grief without applying pressure that forces Elara into a micro-choice with visible cost. The final "courageously kind" stance is asserted through label-speak ("sympathy stirred," "courageously kind in her vulnerability") rather than shown through embodied contradiction. Mother's presence is entirely retrospective, weakening present-tense agency.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elowen's boredom and yearning for novelty are established, but his immortal psychology remains abstract. The decision to trigger the mutiny reads as ornamental curiosity rather than embodied contradiction or stakes-raising choice. The curse's "dimensional awareness" is label-only; we never see him wrestle with competing impulses or pay a visible cost for his action beyond a generic dissolution into "endless novelty."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's motivation (finding "mathematics of a fair trade") is clear and distinct from his father's con artistry, but his transformation via the ink vapor reads too cleanly—"rigid adherence to scruple" liquefying without on-page contradiction or struggle. The micro-choices (probing pockets, timing footsteps) anchor agency, yet the vapor-induced shift bypasses earned internal conflict. Victor remains a static corpse; no dynamic relationship pressure tests Eli's stance. Embodied emotion is thin: grief is "hands steady despite grief," a label without contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thorne's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" is established, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("earnestly studious," "passion leashed to precision"). The protagonist's final choice to release the notepad lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost—he "watched from his pavilion" in "restrained triumph" without foreclosing a path or struggling with competing impulses. The town's revival happens off-stage, and Thorne's agency in the closure reads passive observation rather than a micro-choice that narrows options. Emotional progression is smoothed into triumph without the hypocrisy, self-deception, or flawed calculus that would root the change in character particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; the wanderer passively collects fragments without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost until the final beat. Motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of memories") but never tested through on-page tension between competing wants. The "death" backstory arrives late and feels convenient rather than earned through prior dramatized struggle. The final "smile into the fog" reads as aesthetic closure without foregrounding the psychological price of reclaimed identity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to decode the riddle drives him to the observatory and through the cello ritual, but his internal contradiction—debunking myths while crafting symbolic talismans—remains asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. The late-stage discovery ("joy in transient seeking") arrives through the cello performance rather than a cost-bearing decision that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("gloomy cheerfulness," "ephemeral compass") and stock gestures (wry smile, bow grazing strings) that flatten voice particularity. The ending declares peace without visible renunciation or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's trait ("orderly intuitive") appears as a label repeated throughout but rarely manifests as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "dual allegiance" creates potential internal conflict, yet her choices proceed smoothly without visible struggle or trade-offs—she executes her graffiti campaign without meaningful friction between carnival chaos and mainland order. Interiority relies heavily on abstract assertions ("her attribute shone," "intuition foresaw") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The closure choice (continuing to paint, absorbing newcomers) lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, and the story tells us she succeeded without dramatizing what she surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and sustained—photographing the last grain drives his summit climb and outlast strategy. His "purposefully curious" nature is shown through concrete actions (climbing beyond protocol, deploying timed signals). However, interiority leans heavily on label-based reflection ("dawnlit melancholy," "space age's twilight") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to photograph the grain feels inevitable rather than earned through internal conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's blindness is asserted rather than embodied through groping, spatial memory, or error; he "oversaw" and commanded flawlessly without contradiction or struggle. The drone repair motivation ("honor the machine's whispered story") reads abstract and label-driven; no on-page micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Apprentices remain functional hands; no relationship friction tests Elias's choices. The final smile is serene satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Harlan's motivation is clearly stated and his dry wit voice is consistent, but his choices remain largely observational rather than conflicted. The interiority often labels states ("pulse quickened," "confidence swelled") rather than embodying contradictory impulses under pressure. The final departure reads as inevitable from setup rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Internal contradiction and micro-choices that alter present options are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely by the repeated label "infinitely patient" and "cryptic," with no embodied contradictions or internal friction. His motivation ("to restore shared balance") remains an abstract declaration never tested by a trade-off or competing desire. The spectral townsfolk appear as passive recipients rather than pressure sources, and the protagonist's choices feel procedural—strike fork, walk, observe—without visible cost or renunciation. The ending grants him complete success with no foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned transformation or Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The perfume vial's memory-unlocking effect prompts her to override panic, but the mechanics feel convenient—tender childhood memories arrive on cue to dissolve terror without visible internal struggle. Interiority leans heavily on elevated, poetic phrasing ("lonesome splendor," "ephemeral whispers") that reads more as atmospheric narration than character-particular thought under duress. The final choice to unsnarl the hush lacks prior micro-choices showing her weighing cost; she simply persists because the vial steadies her, reducing agency to a passive reception of the relic's gift.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias pursues a clear goal (redeeming his father's legacy through vengeance) and his interior motivation is legible, but the murders themselves remain abstract—we never see him choosing a victim or wrestling with the act in scene. The embodied emotion is thin: "Elias smiled faintly" and murmuring confessions lack visceral contradiction or cost in the moment. The final act (releasing his father's shade) feels more ritual than earned renunciation; no prior beat shows him genuinely torn between violence and peace, so the closure reads smooth rather than purchased.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation remains abstract label-work ("regrets," "sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "choice" to join her is passive—venom takes him rather than a decision he makes under pressure. Interior life consists of told memories and declarative epiphanies ("debt she sought to repay") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The ghost bride operates as symbolic apparatus, not a character whose choices create friction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared through label-heavy interiority ("hauntingly optimistic," "poetic wharf weaver") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses under pressure. The sleepwalking trance erases agency for the entire climactic sequence; her hands move by "instinct" and "dream grip," leaving no visible trade-off or choice that she consciously forecloses. The final "work complete" arrival lacks any embodied struggle or cost—she simply awakens to find success. Emotional states are asserted ("fragile bloom," "orchid solace") without concrete sensory anchors or behavioral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to restore faith is declared but never tested through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she excavates, finds artifacts, rebuilds the sundial without meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("faith, once lost, stood solid") but the text never dramatizes what she renounces or what specific impulse she overcomes. Memory fragments appear but do not tilt present stance through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—crafting identities in margins—but her actions feel more procedural than pressured by contradictory impulses. The backstory (data-archivist awakening) anchors present stakes, yet the chalk-drawing sequence reads as competent execution without visible struggle or mistake that compounds before resolution. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("defiant joy," "heart racing") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to mail the letter lacks a felt cost that forecloses a path; she pauses to scan for tails but no trade-off materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is present but heavily abstracted through label-like descriptions ("wisdom as foolishness," "motivation burned deeper"). Her choices at the end—slipping the chart into the courier's satchel—feel mechanical rather than embodying internal contradiction under pressure. The disguised-fool persona is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. Embodied emotion is scarce; "eyes sharpened" and "mind raced" replace concrete physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to find "the moment before deciding" is clear and sustained, but her choices feel driven more by the story's need to deploy elements than by contradictory interior impulses. The fierce tenderness label appears repeatedly without embodied friction—no moment shows her torn between pride and vulnerability in real time. The healing shard and spirit-song mechanics dominate her actions, leaving little room for micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Thorne materializes as a vision-reward rather than through an earned confrontation with her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to graft meaning onto old wounds is established through her brother's death, and the decryption sequence offers micro-choices. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final whispered promise feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Kael remains passive throughout, reducing relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to rediscover joy is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. The interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("pensive mirth," "daydream's haze") rather than embodied contradiction. Her decision to display the fragment feels inevitable without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire challenged. The final "grinning softly" lands as summary rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to "trade her ironclad certainty for the spark of curiosity" is clearly stated, but his internal contradiction or struggle never emerges—he proceeds methodically through the bewitchment without visible cost or doubt. Lena's transformation occurs entirely through received magic rather than her own agency; her "nested awakenings" are imposed rather than earned through on-page choice. The hobo nickel guides his work passively (reflecting flaws) until he weaponizes it, but no micro-choice under pressure reveals competing values. Diagnostic phrasing pervades peak moments: "certainty fracturing like glass under sonic pressure," "her skepticism had armored a forgotten wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is labeled charming rogue scholar but remains a flat archetype making gestures without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. His "spark of defiance" and "rogue charisma" are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Voss and secondary characters blur into ornamental ciphers; no relationship pressure forces any choice. Interior voice converges with all other description into the same elevated register, erasing individual consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen is rendered primarily through label-only attributes ("shyly unstoppable," "insomniac poet") and lyric summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Interior experience remains abstract and diagnostic ("pain's photosynthesis," "centuries of longing") without embodied contradiction or a specific hierarchy of values tested on the page. The final turn—pressing the postcard into an alcove and sinking into sleep—arrives without prior causal struggle or visible cost that forecloses a live option. Motivations are declared poetically but never tensioned by on-page decision friction.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early (preserve forgotten names, atone for losing Lirien) but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak: "foxglove regret," "toxic bloom of remorse," "poisonous bloom of sorrowful purpose." These phrases recur as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The final beat offers no visible trade-off or renunciation—she completes her quest, the tube shatters, and she kneels amid success with "foxglove tears," which reads as performed emotion rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No on-page micro-choice between competing goods appears; the escalation is a tour through wings, not a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and consistent, and the ink-well sequence shows embodied action under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on label phrases ("cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") repeated without fresh embodiment across beats. The final choice feels somewhat externally resolved by the magical mechanism rather than by contradictory internal impulses wrestling on the page. Thorne remains largely reactive, a voice for doubt rather than a pressure source with his own stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to harmonize tradition and progress is clear, but his arc suffers from over-articulated interiority that reads diagnostic rather than embodied. The "encrypted compassion pierced his dappled resolve" moment epitomizes therapy-speak that distances rather than immerses. His trembling appears as a repeated physical label without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to redesign the floodgates feels inevitable from the prompt rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to preserve his wife's songs is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The pivot from fraud to honesty arrives through summary ("mapping frantically, he traced a new pattern: honesty") rather than embodied choice under pressure. Lila's accusation "You're a fraud" and immediate forgiveness feel under-motivated; her internal conflict is absent. The final death scene tells us he held a "faint smile" but does not dramatize what choice or renunciation he made in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen's motivation is declared ("featherly determined," "to know why some boundaries pulsed holy") but her interiority reads as abstract philosophical musing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The father reunion at the end arrives without earned cost or visible trade-off; she "crosses—not erasing distance, but weaving it into arrival" is label-only resolution. Emotions are asserted through poetic modifiers ("featherly," "resolute as quill barbs") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. No meaningful change or renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "motivation to learn the rhythm of belonging" remains an abstract label rather than a dramatized need with contradictory impulses. Interior states are heavily filtered through stock phrasing ("softly ingenious mind," "captivated him instantly") and therapy-speak ("belonging not as possession, but as this seamless interweave"). The final epiphany arrives through declaration rather than embodied struggle, and Theo's shift from isolation to connection lacks visible internal friction. Choices feel steered by thematic agenda rather than character-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (discovering why paths disappear) is clear and drives her investigation, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The "cheerful gloom" mood is asserted repeatedly but rarely emerges from concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance ("paths vanish to make room for wilder flights") arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized resistance or visible cost that forecloses an alternative. Her sea-foam recollectionist role remains ornamental—label-rich but without occupational constraints shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jasper's analytical trait is established through observation patterns, but his motivation—"serenade monotony with creativity"—remains abstract and lacks embodied internal conflict. The orchestrated serendipity reads more as authorial puppet-mastery than genuine character-driven choice with visible cost. Elara's arc is summary-told (grandfather memories flood in) rather than dramatized through micro-choices, and the lanky man appears conveniently with zero prior setup. The final "spark reignited" moment relies on label-speak rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—to inscribe cosmic verse on mortal skin—is declared but never dramatized as an internal conflict with competing impulses. The spontaneous anchoring triggers panic described in labels ("obsidian grace fracturing like flawed glass") rather than embodied contradiction. Her shift from exile-bound purity to returning to Kai reads as plot convenience; no on-page micro-choice reveals why gaps in stars suddenly override her stated need for isolation. Kai appears only in the final third as a passive canvas, offering no relationship pressure or status friction.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is given consistent traits (harbor glazier, seeks value in mundane) but never faces contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. His motivation is stated repeatedly rather than tested through difficult choices with embodied cost. The communion scene unfolds as passive reception of visions rather than active struggle, and the final "renewed resolve" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page transformation. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") without grounding in specific sensory experience or micro-choices that alter his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's scarred backstory is established through extensive reflection, but his present agency is thin—he primarily listens and shares memory rather than making choices under live pressure. Lena appears late (~40% mark) and remains a static receiver; her vow at the end is declared but not tested. Interior contradiction is absent; Elias moves smoothly from pain to pedagogy without competing impulses, and the porcelain box functions as symbolic prop rather than constraint on choice. The final exchange ("I won't bargain mine away angry") reads as epiphany-by-declaration rather than earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented through abstract labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") rather than embodied contradictions acting under pressure. Her motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" remains declarative; no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or visible cost. The shell-arranging sequence is ritual without friction—no moment where her method fails, forcing adaptation. The final triumph arrives without genuine struggle or foreclosed path, reading as inevitable success rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his return to the manor is causally grounded in the echoes speaking to him. Interiority is generally concrete ("thorns snagging his sleeves like desperate fingers"), though some moments drift toward stock phrasing ("Heart pounding"). The final choice to sketch atonement feels somewhat unmotivated by prior on-page struggle—the shift from horror to duty arrives quickly without sufficient internal friction. His embodied emotion is present but the peak transformation lacks visible cost that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen's motivation (to change mirrors) is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Her interior life reads as label-only: "perceptively calm," "elusive," "grace" appear as qualities asserted by the narrator rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed-heartbeat mechanism is told in exposition ("she must renew it") without showing her weighing cost against desire or experiencing embodied fear. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost is earned; she completes her ritual and dissolves as before, a static arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("burned deep: to anchor ideals in practice") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The delegates receive operatively gentle micro-targeting ("Lord Kael, your son's grave…"), yet these appeals feel mechanical rather than embodied in Elara's internal conflict. The spectral vision of the boy arrives as ornamental guilt rather than a lived contradiction that shapes her final choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("trembling hand," "quiet ache") without character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is presented with contradictory impulses—amoral philanthropist who secretly weeps for extinct birds—but the interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("sentiment veiled," "fractured grace") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the egg reads as motivated, yet the piece tells us he's sentimental rather than showing it through contradictory on-page behavior in a high-stakes moment. Backstory dominates (water grabs, ribbon-cuttings, museum vault) without anchoring in present stimuli that alter his stance; the reflection flattens pressure instead of charging it, triggering BRR penalty routing to Q7 and capping Q1 at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to defy conformity is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her "chastity" functions as a label rather than a constraint that shapes decisions under pressure. The crowd's reaction is summarized ("eyes widened in alarm") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal her internal struggle. No antagonist or secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving her actions unopposed and her transformation unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior remains abstract through most beats—"uncommonly serene," "urbane poise," "motivation crystal"—rather than embodied contradiction. The turn toward abandoning puppet shows is asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle; we see no impulse pulling him back toward the bars' thrill even as he resolves to quit. The reflection on past shows (marionettes, patron's grief) arrives as summary without present micro-choices that tilt his stance. Backstory exceeds ~30% without interleaving sufficient on-page decisions that alter options in the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is told rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Her grief and reverence for overlooked histories arrive fully formed in reflective exposition; no contradictory impulses complicate her stance. The grandmother's tales function as backstory label without on-page friction—Elara never hesitates, doubts, or pays visible cost for honoring them. The final descent ("transiently rooted no more") asserts completion without showing what she has foreclosed or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves through the sanctum without friction between competing desires. Her "technically gentle" precision and forgiveness arc are told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The apprentice's injury is backstory payload without present consequence that alters a visible choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("guilt into purpose") rather than dramatized as competing wants colliding in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—to discover why paths choose walkers—is declared but never tested through meaningful choices. Her "transcendence" arrives via dream-pod exposition rather than earned struggle; she reclines, receives neural mist, and emerges "wholeness" without forfeiting a competing value or confronting a blind spot. Interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("foresight hindsight only," "no more only") and abstract states rather than embodied contradiction. The final laugh and walk feel asserted rather than motivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ezar's frugality is asserted repeatedly but never creates a meaningful choice with cost—he never foregoes anything that matters to the outcome. His motivation (covenant-seeking) remains abstract; no on-page moment shows him weighing competing goods or paying a relational or emotional price. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart quickened") and label-only devotion rather than embodied contradiction. The final "thrifty act" of extinguishing the lamp is ornamental, not a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias reads as a type (the scheming pacifist archetype) rather than an individual with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Thorne's transformation is entirely passive—he receives the music box's effects without agency, making the change feel unearned. Interiority defaults to summary labels ("resentment fueling his urge," "cellular memory surged") rather than embodied contradiction. The moment "Thorne understood: resentment was the broken pin" exemplifies diagnostic label-speak at a pivotal beat, undermining emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias displays a clear goal and embodied action (placing mirrors, adjusting the sextant, synchronized breathing), and the final embrace forecloses his solitary mourning. However, interiority remains largely abstract—"refused to let illusions rule him," "fragile hope he could not abandon"—without concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wife-apparition lacks autonomous pressure; she is purely symbolic, and the protagonist's internal conflict is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation and the final choice is earned by prior material, but interiority leans heavily on description of his actions rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Lila's "feisty" trait is asserted repeatedly through narration and dialogue tags ("endearingly feisty," "feisty spark," "feisty shove," "feisty grin") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The joint mending work at the climax does show collaboration under storm pressure, but emotional progression resolves too cleanly without lingering irrationality or cost that complicates the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared but never tested through genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The bewildered-to-purposeful arc is summarized ("bewildered no more") rather than earned through dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on abstract labeling ("brightened disquiet," "philosophical breakthroughs") without embodied, character-particular contradiction. The cameo inheritance operates as a puzzle piece rather than a crucible that forces trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("ignited; she'd long sought that fabled sanctum") but never encounters meaningful friction or internal conflict. The "carefully resourceful" trait appears as label-only descriptor ("carefully resourceful with every scrap of lore," "Carefully resourceful, she inventoried") without constraining a choice or creating visible cost. The time traveler remains flat, serving only as delivery mechanism. Decisions throughout feel procedural rather than character-driven—Elara solves problems through rote application of her skill set without struggle or change.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to find the garden is stated but her choices feel predetermined rather than tested under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The chimera twin remains a memory-construct without on-page presence until the final third, so no relationship pressure exists. The discovery-to-reunion arc is summarized across years rather than dramatized in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is given a clear trait ("warmly methodical") and a consistent motive (translate confusion into clarity), but her internal experience remains largely cerebral and observer-like. The climactic merge action is executed with competence but no visible struggle, cost, or contradictory impulse acting in scene—she simply performs a puzzle solution. The final choice feels more like completing an archive task than foreclosing a path with felt weight, limiting the upper range despite consistent motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Mapkeeper's motivation (protecting the caves' harmony) is clear and consistent throughout, with embodied resolve shown through measured steps and steady breath. However, interiority remains abstract—"hammered repose" and similar phrases are repeated as labels rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice (positioning the stone, channeling will) feels more ritual than psychologically earned conflict; we never see her wrestle with competing goods or face a moment where her method might fail her.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("doubt gnawed," "hope stirred") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "prove that coincidences held meaning" remains a declared thesis that never encounters an on-page test where she must choose between conflicting goods. The final weeping and descent feel summary-gestural rather than earned by micro-choices under pressure. Retrocognition is label-only; visions are told, not dramatized as a constraint forcing tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" is declared repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or meaningful internal conflict. Her "preemptively nostalgic" trait functions as poetic labeling without constraining a single choice—she kneels, traces, conjectures, and ascends in a smooth arc devoid of hesitation or cost. The final doubt ("Had she always been Summer-Quill, or sculpted from another's shadow?") arrives too late and dissolves immediately into affirmation, reading as ornamental rather than earned. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("collective memory pulsed within") that replaces embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly signaled (defy hopelessness through fireworks) and drives his choices, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("hopelessness clung like damp fog") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to replicate the mosaic design is stated rather than dramatized as a moment of internal friction. Chanting functions more as atmospheric tic than character-specific coping mechanism that constrains or enables under stress. No visible cost trades off against his goal; the launch succeeds without complication and villagers simply appear in wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elaron's motivation is clear and his "warmly observant" trait shapes his method, but his interiority remains thin—he feels more like a vessel for the concept than a contradictory mind under pressure. Mira's crisis is told rather than embodied; her trembling hands and cracking voice are gestural shortcuts, and her epiphany arrives without visible internal struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The backstory about her village and the transition crisis is recounted, not dramatized through micro-choices that alter present options. The final exchange feels like a neat handoff rather than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and collection motivation are present, but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("stretching contracted fear into open sky") rather than embodied sensation. The gilded-hush harvest shows some micro-choice under pressure (draping scarf, siphoning essence), but the noise-weaver confrontation deflates immediately with no genuine cost—she simply darts away. The father's bunkers frame her rebellion but remain told rather than tested on the page, weakening the final "changed" claim.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's singular motivation ("to teach silence how to comfort") is stated rather than revealed through contradictory impulses. His actions follow a demonstrative arc (monitoring, explaining, catalyzing) without internal conflict or genuine stakes—he never struggles, doubts, or pays a visible cost. Mira and the children remain flat recipients whose compliance is immediate and unearned. The interiority relies on abstract label-speak ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a cipher throughout; her "wisely adventurous" trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible cost. The ending moment—touching the throne and choosing "stewardship, not conquest"—arrives without prior struggle between competing desires or a dramatized hierarchy of values. Internal experience is flattened by label-heavy diction ("futuristic nostalgia enveloped her") and diagnostic clarity ("understanding that claiming it meant stewardship") that no one possesses mid-crisis. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are absent; she moves through set-pieces without genuine struggle or consequence that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The shadow keeper's interiority relies heavily on figurative language ("vines of dependency strangling," "false bellows inflating") that substitutes for embodied contradiction. The central motivation—teaching suffocating to breathe—is articulated through metaphor rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final act (heating the ring, hearing her first breath) gestures toward earned change, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract: we see no moment where tenderness wars with resolve in simultaneous, embodied action. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("teach suffocating to breathe," "forced her clinging vines to loosen") lowers specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is labeled "virtuously mischievous" and "pyramid scheme survivor" but these traits function as ornamental backstory rather than driving on-page choices under pressure. His motivation to distribute diamonds emerges late and feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The peak choice—twisting the bolt and deciding to share diamonds—lacks visible internal conflict or felt cost; we see no foreclosed path, no genuine struggle between competing goods. Interiority consists largely of abstract concepts ("pressure of lured friends, evaporated savings") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "uncover the hidden truth" is signaled early, but his interiority is thin—mostly told through phrases like "musing" and "eloquently silent" rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to burn the documents and dismantle the dynasty reads as a straightforward response to discovery rather than a trade-off earned by competing impulses. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship dynamics are absent. Reflection dominates without micro-choices that tilt present stance, flattening the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen remains a withdrawn observer whose interiority is delivered through abstract labels ("ecstatic thrill," "transfixed") rather than embodied contradiction. The murmured oath and final wrist-coiling represent choices, but motivation stays decorative—"capture the shape of possibility" never faces a dramatized tradeoff that would reveal competing impulses. Emotional states are asserted ("shivering bliss," "trembled with anticipation") without micro-choices that would anchor them in character-particular perception. The ending grants mastery without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and sustained, with embodied grief ("broken heart a fresh wound") informing her archival work. Her choices at the inciting incident (investigating the dust patterns, prying open the seam) show agency under pressure. However, the final transformation feels overstated rather than earned through contradictory impulses: "her steps lighter toward the door" and "healed not just history, but herself" declare change without dramatizing the internal friction that would make it credible. The connection between finding one letter and healing her betrothed's death lacks sufficient on-page cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains thinly drawn, defined more by labels ("wiry scavenger," "underestimated rebel") than embodied choices under pressure. His interiority consists largely of abstract declarations about indifference and tyranny rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic booth discovery feels unearned—he passively follows a puddle-map rather than wrestling with competing wants or fears. Motivation is asserted ("holding the line") but never tested through a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is driven by sister-loss and prophecy-silencing, but his interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("eerie nostalgia," "vested hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile ("nostalgic for the hush he had wrought, eerie in its fragile permanence") reads as aesthetic pose, not earned renunciation with visible cost. Emotional progression is asserted through labels ("resolve," "crested") without on-page micro-choices that alter tactics. The protagonist operates in isolation with no relationship crucible or secondary pressure to test motive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lir's motivation is declared ("to decode the message in falling leaves") but never tested by competing desires or genuine stakes. His interior experience consists largely of label-only emotions ("mossy delight," "heart quickening") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The sylph conversation at the climax reads as exposition delivery rather than character pressure, and the protagonist's agency amounts to assembling monuments without visible cost or foreclosed paths. No on-page change or renunciation alters Lir's stance by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "befriend uncertainty" is stated early but remains largely abstract; his decisive shift comes through finding journals rather than a hard choice between competing goods. The compass rose triggers action more than internal contradiction does. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("uncertainly certain") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final laugh and crumbling certainties offer closure, but the arc feels more like confirmation of a thesis than a painful trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (understanding name-weight) is declared but remains abstract; the coin-spinning and crucible-mending feel ritualistic rather than conflict-driven choices with embodied doubt. The brother's return arrives as resolution rather than complication, and no genuine mistake or miscalculation occurs on-page—she simply succeeds. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("luminous regret," "golden resolve") and the final embrace offers catharsis without visible cost or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (to integrate laughter into healing) is clearly stated but rarely tested on the page; the climactic moment simply executes her method without internal conflict or cost to her. The "modestly fearless" attribute is declared three times but never constrains a choice or creates a visible tradeoff. Harlan's confessions are given extensive stage time, yet his character arc—from guilt to laughter—feels thin because we never see him resist or complicate Elara's approach. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("luminous ache," "spectral fingers") rather than embodied, character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior is dominated by abstract concepts ("mathematics of mercy," "fractal convergence") rather than embodied contradiction. Her enhanced proprioception is label-only; we're told it maps bark ridges "like a lover's scars" but this never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The trauma responses are mechanical recitations of torture rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "rising" feels unmotivated—no prior choice earned her release, so the ending reads as convenient closure rather than a path foreclosed with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to honor overlooked histories") is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us she "yearns to preserve" and "realizes" rather than showing her wrestle with competing desires or costs on the page. Interior life consists of label-stacked phrases ("elusively tangible," "chaotic intuitions," "eternal instant") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The final "fulfillment" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as declared success rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theo's motivation ("compulsion to discover what ceilings hide") drives him into the office, but once inside his actions are largely responsive to ghost prompts rather than self-generated choices under competing pressures. The climactic decision to open the grate feels inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible cost—he performs a service, the ghosts dissolve, and he pockets a talisman. Interiority leans on label-only emotions ("heart quickened, but he felt no fear") and lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beats. The gift of seeing ghosts remains a告知 trait rather than a constraint that forces difficult micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation ("to compress eternity into a moment") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The uncorking decision feels predetermined rather than earned by visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphysical labels ("negotiable reality," "rustling awakenings") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The final "laughter" and "whispered approval" are asserted emotions without the messy irrationality or visible cost that would ground them.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—reimagining the Aetherians to legitimize a new uprising—is clearly stated and drives his heist. However, his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("burnished sorrow," "half-forged stanza") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final act (hurling the shard) serves his goal but reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision forged from competing impulses acting simultaneously. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation (daughter's shadow-sleep) is emotionally anchored, but his execution of the repair lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradiction. The protagonist operates with unchallenged expertise; no mistakes compound, no flaws create friction. The "honest heart" proof via the flower removes moral ambiguity exactly when stakes should bite. Emotional progression flatlines after the climax—tears and smiles arrive on cue without embodied cost or credible irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations remain abstract throughout; "to find the place where explanations fail" is declared but never grounded in concrete want versus fear. Her internal state is told via label ("obsession," "resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climax choice—pulling three hinges—reads mechanically without visible cost or foreclose; she emerges with bottled petrichor and vague transformation, no path closed. The expedition guardians appear as decorative exposition rather than forcing a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is labeled "spirited" and "perpetually learning" repeatedly but these traits never force a difficult choice with visible cost. Her interior life consists of abstract reverie rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The magic lantern provides convenient projections (Mira and Kai) who whisper solutions rather than forcing Elara to discover through struggle. The climactic sculpture-building feels like competent execution without genuine obstacles or mistakes that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is largely abstract and label-driven ("quietly driven," "tender ache," "umbral tenderness swelled") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's emotional arc reads as a sequence of declarations about feeling rather than lived tension: no genuine struggle between competing wants surfaces on the page. The climactic realization—"the flowers' secret was vulnerability's grace"—arrives as an unearned epiphany delivered through exposition rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Motivation remains static across the entire arc; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to uncover suppressed truth is clearly established, but his interior life consists largely of label-heavy exposition ("solemn duty," "searing pull," "motivation realized in the clutch of revelation"). The retrocognitive trap creates spectator status—"Elias-yet-not, compelled to witness"—draining agency from the peak beats. The debris-oath arrangement offers one meaningful micro-choice that earns the final release, lifting the score modestly, but contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene; the arc reads as externally imposed rather than earned through internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a vessel for conceptual machinery rather than a character with embodied contradiction. His rejection of "false comfort" and motivation to "reimagine civilization" are declared and re-declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost that forces a visible tradeoff. The phantoms offer temptation in a single beat, dismissed "with a wave of his hand"—no struggle, no price. Interior life consists of alchemical abstractions ("working memory," "conceived," "volatile elixir") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and sustained, but his internal experience leans heavily on ornamental interiority ("velvet disquiet…luxurious unease threading through his veins like aged wine laced with ash") that obscures embodied contradiction. The childhood memory provides backstory linkage, yet the final vow feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the loneliness mentioned arrives as summary label in the penultimate paragraph without prior dramatization of competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (lifting the shaving, murmuring incantations, withdrawing it) but read as procedural steps rather than pressure-tested decisions with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated clearly but her interior landscape remains largely abstract—"wild serenity," "furiously tranquil"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The physical embodiment is present (trembling fingers, silver braids tugged by wind) but peaks lean on oxymoronic labels rather than showing her torn between preservation and risk through micro-choices. The final smile and readiness feel declared rather than earned by visible cost that forecloses a prior path. No secondary character pressure on the page to test status dynamics or relationship friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias possesses clear motivation (favoring listening over noise) and makes the key switch choice at midnight, but his interior life is largely told through abstract declarations ("credibly curious," "humble resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The decades of preparation are summarized rather than dramatized, leaving the peak choice feeling pre-determined rather than earned through on-page struggle. Micro-choices exist (gripping the rope, checking instruments) but lack visible internal friction or competing impulses that would make the final act feel costly. The long reflection on method and philosophy flattens present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's spiritual curiosity is declared but never genuinely tested by a conflicting impulse—he simply observes and empathizes without internal friction. The trembling vulnerability is asserted as motivation but dissolves without cost when he has his epiphany; no path is foreclosed. Key moments like "vulnerability was no weakness" arrive as delivered wisdom rather than earned through dramatized choice. The character reads as a vessel for theme rather than an agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The recluse's interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence," "astonishment") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. His motivation to "safeguard that weight" is asserted rather than earned through competing desires acting simultaneously in scene. The ghost-covenant discovery unfolds as observation rather than choices under pressure; he deciphers but never faces a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost until the final stasis. The ending acceptance reads as Earned Stasis, but the emotional progression is smoothed rather than layered with credible irrationality or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely through label-only interiority ("burning need to understand the texture of time") and passive observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His borrowed heart and chronosurgeon backstory remain decorative labels that never constrain a choice. The final "weaver" role arrives without earned causality—no prior struggle forces him to broadcast the listing or become a dispenser of fragments. Lira's urn triggers visions but no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; he simply receives revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") is declared early but never tested by competing desires or genuine cost. His actions follow a frictionless path—find feather, fly kite, repair kite—without internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs. The "warmly attentive" attribute appears as a repeated label rather than a trait that constrains choice under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("woven dawns," "discord incarnate") instead of embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely by trait labels—"gently systematic," "brazen calm"—repeated across the text without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. His decision to wire the orchard unfolds as a settled plan executed without genuine struggle; the terminal diagnosis lands with declarative acceptance ("Plenty of time") and never resurfaces as an on-page cost that forecloses paths or alters tactics. The ending shows his "spirit lingering" and the work succeeding, erasing the promised mortal cost and reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned endurance. Interior life remains abstract and therapized ("brazen calm eternal") instead of showing perception degrading under dying or choices riven by contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (understanding homecoming chemistry) is clear and consistent, driving her pilgrimage to the tower. However, interiority relies heavily on elevated abstraction ("luminous skepticism," "academically rebellious") rather than embodied contradiction. The convergence with Kai and Mira happens without friction or visible cost—they simply enter together in an "unspoken pact." The final moment dissolves doubt into "chemical harmony" without dramatizing what Elara forfeits or endures; the shift reads declarative rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thorne's motivation is stated clearly (garden reclaiming battlefield), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses appear on the page, only a "perpetual shadow" and "stoic mask cracking with purpose." The action unfolds as mission execution rather than conflicted choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is minimal; most affect is described generically ("burned deep," "lightness") rather than felt through specific bodily perception. The final departure feels declarative rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to find Mira drives the trek, but interiority leans heavily on poetic label-speak ("wild hush," "tinted revelations") rather than embodied contradiction. The reunion reveals Mira's transformation, yet her survival and role shift arrive through exposition rather than choices under pressure. The leaf functions as talisman but doesn't force a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Elias's shift from body-hunter to life-hunter is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to explore is stated but remains abstract; her "gift" is told rather than shown constraining choices under pressure. The decision to enter the rift feels unmotivated—no dramatized internal conflict weighs survival against exploration, and her isolation never translates into embodied emotion that would make the leap credible. The family lore provides backstory texture but doesn't impose a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elarion's "chivalrous thief" and "apprentice of wonder" labels are repeated frequently but rarely dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure. The core motivation ("embrace the unknown with open arms") is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interior voice relies on stock phrasing ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") that feel like prompt echoes rather than lived contradiction. The swap itself proceeds without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path—visions assail him, he laughs, shatters the piece, and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Thorne's motivation—to chronicle small gestures—is established but remains largely declarative rather than embodied through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The "benevolently ruthless" attribute functions as a label without visible tradeoffs that constrain action. Interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") instead of concrete, character-particular thought that degrades under stress. The final "unbinding" reads as a ritual completion rather than an earned choice that forecloses a path with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to map home is clear and consistent, but her interior life is diluted by dense figurative language that obscures moment-to-moment embodied reactions. The final "understanding" that home is the labyrinth itself reads as an assertion rather than a choice earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices are present (lifting the stone, tracing glyphs) but feel procedural rather than emotionally conflicted. The passivity—visions "cracked open," memories "surged"—reduces agency at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's guilt over rigging a tournament is established early and his internal struggle is embodied through the pawn-fidgeting gesture, but the interiority often slides into label-heavy abstraction ("fierce repose," "gnawing guilt," "desperate father whose error stemmed from love twisted by poverty"). The final shift to self-forgiveness reads as declared rather than earned through on-page contradiction or visible trade-off; we see him "mentally traverse" and "realize" but no true choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The trait "fidgets productively" is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a decision or creates friction—it functions as ornament rather than dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—avenging her father's exile—appears late and is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her "innocently mischievous" trait reads as a label repeated across beats without embodied contradiction or visible cost; the winking and giggling feel performed rather than rooted in conflicted interiority. The poetry sessions involve a crowd of undifferentiated youths and adults whose reactions are summarized in generic terms ("murmured," "wept verse") rather than shown through distinct speech or gesture. Agency at closure is unclear: Elara "smiles" and "dreams," but no on-page choice forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist's uncertainty is declared but rarely manifested in on-page micro-choices under pressure; the statue-matching sequence proceeds mechanically without hesitation or competing impulses. Interiority consists largely of label-only emotions ("lungs burning," "uncertain fingers steadying") and therapy-speak summaries ("intentions mended in gold") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation from "uncertain" to "certain" is asserted without dramatized cost or visible forfeiture of a path. Backstory dominates (~40% of the text) but remains expository; the five pockmark confessions summarize past failures rather than tilting present stance through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (fulfilling a childhood promise) is clear and consistent, but his interiority leans heavily on nostalgic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The mirror-cracking opener and seashell completion provide embodied action, yet the cave sequence feels observational—he kneels, paints, raises the shell—without visible internal conflict or a difficult choice that narrows options with felt cost. The holographic reveal and final placement read as fulfillment of a long-deferred vow, but the stakes never sharpen into a trade-off or renunciation that would elevate the ending's cost beyond wistful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; his "screaming tenderness" reads as label-speak without embodied tension in peak beats. The vial's power conveniently solves his problem without meaningful internal cost or struggle—he uncorks, whispers, and Mira arrives as if summoned by magic rather than his own changed behavior. Mira's arrival feels externally compelled rather than earned by character work; her "wonder" at the door lacks the friction of genuine doubt or the memory of his prior violence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is legible—grief drives him to build a homing signal—and his patchwork past justifies the compulsion. However, his choices lack meaningful internal contradiction; he proceeds methodically without a competing want or fear testing his commitment. The censer vibrating and midnight voices direct him externally, reducing agency to obedience. Embodied emotion surfaces in "tears carving clean tracks through grime," but much of his interiority relies on abstract geography-of-loss metaphors rather than moment-to-moment sensory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is clearly stated, and his choice to use the glass eye is purposeful. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("fractured grace," "veritas nerve") rather than embodied contradiction. The moments with Lira and Thom show outcome but not visceral internal conflict during the act itself. The final reflection—"had occlusion truly healed, or merely draped the fractures in silken deceit?"—reads as externally posed rather than character-specific doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular ("walls lined with salvaged oddities," the ritual of carving driftwood), but the borrowed-memory mechanism arrives without establishing his baseline perceptual signature. The stranger remains a cipher whose motivations are reconstructed entirely through gaps, which is purposeful but risks flattening him into a device. The final choice—pinning the boutonnière and lighting the beam—feels earned by the flashback revelation of Elias's own lost love, though the leap from "the stranger borrowed Elias's memory through village lore" strains causality. Internal contradiction is present (isolation as curse vs. space where echoes meet) but the shift occurs in reflection rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias remains a label rather than a lived character; his interiority consists of exposition ("his life was a solitary archive") and abstraction ("quiet despair") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final transformation—"loneliness ebbed"—is asserted in summary rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is nearly absent; no moment shows his body or perception degrading under the cavern's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's disenchantment is declared but her interior life remains abstract—"reclaim her fraying soul" and "dreams' tyranny" read as placeholder motivations rather than embodied contradictions. The grotto sequence offers minimal micro-choices; she touches the pool and "inhales the bleeding starlight" without visible internal conflict or trade-off in the moment. Thorne functions as a named shadow with no distinct pressure or resistance. The final transformation is asserted ("power woven in menace") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirien's motivation ("capture the density of presence") is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in micro-choices or contradiction. The "palette of resolve" alchemy unfolds as a ritual the reader watches rather than a choice-driven struggle; Thorne's passivity and the whispered secret arrive as plot service without earned friction. Interiority consists of abstract metaphysical labels ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity") rather than particular thought under pressure, and the climax—pouring essences into a shell—lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to chronicle dreams is established, but her interior work leans heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The jealousy method is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final return to the cabin and folding of the scroll suggests endurance, but the cost of that renunciation—what path is foreclosed—remains gestural rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior access is present but remains largely tell-oriented; her motivations (repairing clocks as soul work) are asserted through reflection rather than tested by on-page contradictory impulses. The "lost sense of smell" backstory anchors her character but doesn't constrain a present choice with visible cost—she processes the screw mystery through intuition without friction or error. Miriam's backstory is vivid but remains an embedded tale rather than a live pressure on Elara's decision-making. The piece leans heavily on summary and ascribed emotion ("trembling calm," "humanized by such tales") where embodied contradiction would sharpen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is stated early but feels more thematic than embodied. The crystallizing scars provide a concrete physical manifestation, yet her choices flow too smoothly—no genuine internal contradiction appears when she grips the quill or inscribes runes. The backstory fragments (village fire, shattered staff) are told rather than used to complicate present action. Her triumph arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply succeeds at the ritual and descends "transformed."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to apologize is clear and drives the visit, but her interiority drowns in ornamental metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The guilt is asserted ("clawing at her ribs like a poltergeist") but never shown complicating a live choice on the page. Theo materializes as a passive receiver; his forgiveness arrives without friction, undercutting the earned-cost requirement for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elowen remains an abstraction throughout—"witness," "transformed," but never contradictory or embodied. The story asserts motivation ("driven to unravel cosmic illusions") and transformation ("Elowen, transformed, stood at history's true end") without dramatizing internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The dictionary "pulsed" and he "intoned," but no genuine struggle between competing impulses appears on the page. Interiority consists of stock philosophical phrasing rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to understand what clocks really measure—not mere seconds, but the razor edges between what was and what might never be") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. His interior leans heavily on abstraction ("the razor edges of belief slicing certainty") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The climactic moment—withdrawing the key and understanding time's measure—reads as epiphany without visible cost or genuine internal conflict. Some embodiment exists (trembling hands, squinting), but the emotional arc resolves too tidily without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation to honor her father's genius without succumbing to his demons is clear, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final manuscript discovery feels more like an intellectual realization than a choice with visible cost—she decides to "publish it, responsibly," but no on-page action forecloses a path or dramatizes the weight of that commitment. Emotional progression is mostly smooth and rational, lacking the messier ambivalence or self-deception that would give her arc genuine texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" through cultivated estrangement is stated clearly but never embodied in contradictory impulses during pressure. The final moment with Mira shows his satisfaction at her "getting it," yet we see no internal cost or struggle when he hangs up—just a smile and immediate pivot to the next caller. Mira's arc from desperate connection to resolute goodbye feels compressed and asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The piece tells us Elias "cultivated estrangement methodically" and "lived for the calls," but his interior remains a thesis rather than a lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (preserving small moments) is stated but her choices feel more ritualistic than genuinely conflicted. The walnut-ink archivist role is ornamental; her craft details don't constrain decisions or reveal internal contradiction under pressure. The spectral reunion at the climax arrives through magical mechanics rather than embodied struggle, and her "haunted euphoria" reads as a label applied repeatedly rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending's emotional calculus—smiling, locket warm—resolves too tidily without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias arrives with clear motivation (cure for loneliness) and the moon-rock premise drives his actions, but his "desperately jocular" trait remains largely label-only; the quips are told rather than embodied with visible cost. The community members (Mira, mechanic, poet) exist as one-dimensional figures cycling through the same reciprocity gesture without contradiction or internal friction. The ending declares emotional change ("heart mended") without on-page struggle or a foreclosed path that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elar's motivation (grief over his lover) is clear and his ultrasonic perception is embodied through skin-reading, but the quest unfolds without meaningful internal contradiction or cost until the pool resolves everything in a vision-dump. The renunciation (removing the ring) lacks prior resistance or trade-off; no path is foreclosed with visible struggle. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "quiet blaze," "loss had hollowed him," "emotions long buried stirred"—therapy-speak that abstracts rather than dramatizes. The lover's resolution arrives as convenient epiphany rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "thresh meaning" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through competing impulses or meaningful choice under pressure. The pen-straightening sequence offers a physical action, but the decision lacks internal conflict—she simply does it, then the edits follow as convenient exposition rather than earned struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("contingent relationships flickered," "confident uncertainty") that labels rather than embodies her mental state. The final "smile faintly" and pocket-the-pen gesture feel like closure gestures rather than choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    Finn's motivation to reclaim visibility is declared but never tested through competing desires or internal contradiction. Elara remains a cipher—her "quietly charismatic" presence is asserted repeatedly without embodied action that reveals cost or conflict. The crowd's instant tearful conversion reads as emotional ventriloquism; no individual resists or misunderstands. The finale grants Finn remembrance "by the bittersweet song" without showing what he risks or loses to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established—rescue Theo's promise—but her interior life relies heavily on abstracted emotional labels ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The journey through the archive shows goal pursuit, but pivotal moments like discovering the vandalized portrait or the final vault lean on summary ("tears carving paths") instead of embodied decisions under pressure. The final collapse beside the sculpture feels like emotional release rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority at peak beats uses therapy-adjacent phrasing ("grief into searing focus") that distances rather than inhabits crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority is visible through physical drumming actions that express rebellion, but motivation remains largely asserted through backstory exposition rather than earned through on-page contradictory impulses. The "quietly rebellious spirit" is labeled more than dramatized in choices with visible cost. Kai's resurrection feels convenient rather than a hard-won consequence of her actions, undermining the stakes of her "guinea pig" past. Emotional states lean toward poetic declaration ("auroral sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given clear motivation and competence (map-folding, walk-reading), but his interior life remains surface-level—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The peak choice (aligning the zodiac wheel) feels more puzzle-solving than earned character transformation with visible cost. Harlan is a one-note foil whose defeat doesn't weigh on Elias or alter his stance. The ending gesture ("coin warm in his fist") asserts legend without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what internal price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her "silent empathy" and "spiralingly calm" read as fixed labels rather than embodied traits that constrain action. Umbra remains abstract—hollow eyes, inky folds—without internal contradiction or a visible cost that forecloses a path. The weaving sequence proceeds without error or trade-off, flattening the sense of earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivations are established but remain largely declarative—his "gift" of hearing unspoken words is told rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. The students and shopkeepers exist as vectors for his plan rather than pressuring him with their own stakes. Internal conflict is absent; Elias moves through the plan without visible struggle, doubt, or cost that would foreclose a path. The final smile reads as satisfaction rather than earned change rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara and Kai's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "guarded hearts" premise tells us they've hidden their true natures, but we don't see the cost of that concealment shaping earlier decisions. The scrimshaw's magic unlocks confessions in a single beat ("I ache for the sea's wild call"), bypassing the work of earned internal contradiction. The merfolk reveal arrives as exposition rather than through embodied struggle, and the final transformation reads ornamental rather than foreclosen by prior choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's blank-faced performance and whittling actions are consistently motivated by grief and the drive to "cultivate lightness," but interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory-in-action. The mercy killing backstory is told efficiently but the moral ambiguity never generates on-page friction or a visible hierarchy of values under present pressure. Embodied emotion is present (the blood bead, the voice crack) but the porcelain-mask conceit flattens moment-to-moment contradictions. The final choice to continue performing is consistent but lacks a felt cost that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cloud-shadow poet lacks contradictory impulses; his aesthetic drive operates smoothly without internal friction or cost until the very end. Motivation is declared ("aesthetically driven," "hungered to stride through boundaries") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The tremor of certainty arrives as assertion—"absolute and unyielding"—without prior doubt or struggle to earn it. No secondary character applies pressure, and the transformation at closure ("emerged transformed, cloud-shadows now laced with quartz gleam") reads ornamental rather than a foreclosed path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to seek loveliness where others saw only flaws") is established early and drives his refusal to barter his colorblind sight, but the trait "innocently cunning" reads as label-only assertion—the text tells us he "masked his shrewd insights behind a wide-eyed wonder" without dramatizing tactical deception in scene pressure. Mira's awakening arc is passive; she twitches, opens her eyes, and understands "instantly from the plant witnesses," bypassing embodied struggle. The phoenix negotiation feels thin: Elias's choice to blow an imperfect note is presented as cunning, but the cost (no sight traded) lacks visible sacrifice, weakening the climactic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elowen's motivation ("to feel that texture again, not in flesh, but in the resonant hush") is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through chambers with seamless resolve, questioning assumptions without visible cost to her certainty. The "powerfully gentle" attribute appears as a label without constraining choice or creating friction. Embodied emotion is thin—tears at the end feel asserted rather than earned by contradictory pulls across the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's internal life is asserted rather than contradictory—mourning transmutes into purpose without dramatized struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her motivation feels declared ("vowed to teach these fading stars to bloom") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The shift from rock bottom to purposeful action lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path. Interiority relies on label-only emotion ("subdued ardor," "withering soul") without embodied sensory breakdown or character-particular texture.

    Elara's motivation to map cultural patterns is clear and drives her archival work, but her choices remain largely observational until Theo arrives. The steady-curious attribute is invoked repeatedly as a label rather than shown through contradictory impulses or costly micro-decisions. Theo's confession provides new information but Elara's response—immediately declaring collaborative reverse-engineering—feels predetermined rather than earned through visible internal conflict. The nephew's hollow-eyed desperation is embodied, yet his arc compresses confession and absorption without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to pierce the veil of history's lies") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation at the end—"no longer bound by history's tyranny"—arrives via summary and metaphor ("memories fracturing into steadily unpredictable sparks") without on-page micro-choices that reveal cost or foreclosure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("anguished joy," "heart pounding") and label-only emotion throughout. The final "dance through collapsing halls" reads as convenient competence rather than struggle shaped by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve hope's shape is established, but her interior life collapses into label-heavy abstractions ("luminous regret," "hope's shape") without embodied contradiction or visible micro-choices under pressure. The metamorphosis reads as summary declaration rather than dramatized struggle; we are told she "resolved to act" and "felt the pull" without witnessing genuine internal conflict or a hierarchy of values tested on the page. The stone-ritual sequence advances via passive transformation rather than active decision-making that forecloses competing paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "balance self-respect with compassion" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shedding-layers metaphor structures her reflection, but the internal work remains largely summary ("she resolved," "she peeled back") rather than enacted choice under pressure. The chameleon observation provides some embodied anchor, yet the peak emotional beat—her reconstruction—unfolds as narrated epiphany without visible micro-costs that foreclose options. Interiority leans toward therapeutic self-awareness ("guilt for trusting too freely") instead of messy, contradictory emotion driving a difficult present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to read scars is stated but operates at an abstract level; the surgery's effect and her wound-probing remain largely metaphorical rather than embodied choices under pressure. The plants provide guidance but Elena's agency in the tunnel remains reactive—she follows rather than wrestles with contradictory impulses. The childhood accident backstory is introduced late and told rather than shown, weakening the earned quality of her closure moment. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("scar-thirst") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find where "unused love is stored" ties to her fiancé's death, but the connection feels thin—her choices in the booth (touching the film, prying the panel) read more as passive reception than decisions under pressure. The psychometry visions are vivid but largely delivered to her rather than wrestled from conflicting impulses. Interiority leans on label-speak ("unused love," "incubating") without embodied contradiction; her final descent with "unused love now incubating within her" asserts change rather than earning it through a visible renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (freeing trapped creativity) is clear, but her choices under pressure feel abstract and ritualized rather than psychologically urgent. The internal conflict between fear of idleness and the auroras' demand for rest is stated but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The ending declares creativity "freed" without showing a lived decision that forecloses a path; the transformation reads told rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guard's transformation from "dreamless" to "faint reverie stirring" tracks through the text, but the arc relies heavily on abstract terms ("purpose blooms," "sparks in freighted soul") rather than embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is present but operates at a symbolic register that distances the reader from immediate pressure. The final micro-choice—setting the clock down and walking on—carries some weight but feels inevitable rather than torn. Interiority remains lyric-specific rather than therapy-speak, which preserves voice, but the lack of visceral stakes or competing impulses keeps this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation—rediscovering his "wild frontier"—remains abstract throughout, never translated into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His transformation at the corewheel is asserted through label-heavy epiphany ("feral thoughts stampeding, insights flowering") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The "stray philosopher" framing and the gear-socket reveal feel decorative rather than integral to behavioral particulars. The final renunciation of skepticism lacks visible cost because no on-page choice forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to find unused courage is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The guides function as exposition vessels offering therapy-speak wisdom ("Direct paths bind tighter than any leash") without embodied struggle or distinct agency. Interior life remains abstract and label-driven ("motivation burned brighter") with no micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final transformation is asserted, not earned through on-page contradiction and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is present but largely abstract ("pondered his past silences") rather than embodied. The neural regeneration motif provides concrete physical anchors (tingling limbs, stim-packs), yet peak beats drift into label-speak ("frostbitten hope," "seraphically mundane atonement") without dramatized contradiction. Thorne's "silent-choir" choreography is vivid but one-note; his final choice to accept the bolt lacks visible internal conflict. The ending gesture ("I understand") reads as therapeutic closure rather than a choice forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirion's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as guardian, but his interior life remains largely abstract—"eyes held the weight of fallen epochs" is label-only. The piece tells us he is diminutive and titan-essence but never dramatizes internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His actions align with stated motive, yet the final "smiled faintly" lacks the contradictory impulse or visible cost that would earn a meaningful change at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized primarily through external markers—his witness role, tapping habit, isolation—rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The motivation to understand disappeared paths is clear and sustained, but internal conflict remains thin; the choice to broadcast feels more like resolution of a puzzle than a foreclosure with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in gripping the railing and drumming fingers, but these gestures recur without deepening under pressure. The final stance crystallization reads as intellectual clarity rather than a decision that trades one path for another.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "awkwardly confident" trait appears as label-only repetition without constraining choices or revealing internal conflict in action. The climactic moment—placing palms on the stone, receiving visions—happens *to* her rather than through a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("pulse quickening," "resolve steeling") and therapy-speak abstractions ("meaning pierced the mess") instead of embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to evolve tradition is stated clearly but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she moves from resolve to action without visible ambivalence. The telepathic gift functions as a plot convenience rather than a trait with embodied cost; we never see her struggle with sensory overload or misinterpretation. The final declaration "Tradition evolves with intent, or it crumbles like regime walls" reads as thesis statement rather than earned realization, and the workers' awe replaces dramatized resistance or friction. Backstory dominates the opening third without anchoring micro-choices that tilt present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interior work is concrete—somatic freeze, hands in mulch, the photograph as trigger—but the final encounter with the young artist arrives too smoothly, reading more as demonstration than complication. The therapist-coined "somatic markers" label and the phrase "anchored optimism in realism" edge toward diagnostic self-awareness that flattens mid-crisis interiority. The freeze itself embodies contradiction (terror and stillness coexist), yet the resolution with the visitor lacks an on-page trade-off that costs Elena something specific.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation—to mend his fragmented reality—is established early, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminescent ache," "fragmented reality") rather than embodied contradiction. The untangling action reads more as symbolic ritual than a choice constrained by prior costs; we see no genuine trade-off or foreclosed path. Emotional states are declared ("crestfallen," "ache") instead of shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned by causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elowen's motivation (discovering why time slows in crisis) is stated clearly but remains abstract; his choices in the scene—crushing the drone, stepping into the ink—feel reactive rather than shaped by internal contradiction. The "serene anger" is labeled repeatedly without embodied tension or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Mira's appearance and disappearance function as plot devices without enough relational pressure to test Elowen's values. The final "resolve" is told rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation—to awaken suppressed histories—is established but her internal contradiction ("bravely conflicted") is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The story tells us she wars between duty and urge, then moves swiftly to action without showing the genuine struggle at the decision point. Her agency at the console is clear, but the moment lacks embodied cost or a hierarchy of competing values made visible through micro-choices. The phrase "bravely conflicted no more—action had chosen for her" externalizes the choice rather than making her wrestle with it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her pacifism never faces a genuine test—the sheathed dagger becomes a symbol rather than a choice under fire. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquil blaze," "senseless perception") rather than embodied contradiction. The roses' agency in the climax deflects her own moral calculus, leaving her core conflict unearned. Jax's return and acceptance feel summary-level rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined by "cool-headed" repetition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation is declared (ancient compulsion, fisher's blood) but the choice at closure—securing the echo—feels inevitable without visible internal conflict or foreclosed alternative. The "voiced silence" paradox is intriguing but his interior remains abstract; embodied emotion is sparse. No meaningful cost or path foreclosure is dramatized beyond acquiring the prize.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's observant nature is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final confrontation shows some decision-making with the pen-nib demonstration, but her motivation to defend her father feels declared rather than earned through internal conflict. Thorne's confession arrives too easily without forcing Elara to pay a meaningful cost or make a difficult trade-off. Interiority relies heavily on stock metaphors ("orbits of regret," "binary stars") that abstract emotion rather than embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's guilt over the baby's death is established, but his motivations remain largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "tethering" choice arrives without visible cost or genuine internal conflict—he simply performs the tattoo ritual the letters instruct him to do. Interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("dissonance," "guilt's orchestra") rather than embodied, character-particular perception. The change feels mechanically executed rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's socially perceptive trait is stated repeatedly but her micro-choices under pressure feel authored rather than organically character-driven. Her motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses; she moves through beats executing the artist-mediator role without visible internal friction or cost. The final scattering of the mandala registers as whimsical gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt weight. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("lilac unease," "socially perceptive soul sated") rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The pivotal "rename" action—whispering "Kaelon the Embracer" into the tessera—relies on mystical mechanics rather than earned internal conflict; no micro-choice costs are visible. Kael's transformation arrives via retrocognitive flood rather than his own agency, flattening the arc. The piece leans on labels ("gentle radical," "aberrant mercy") instead of embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interior is established through synesthesia, and her despair-to-possibility arc is legible. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract sensory labeling ("bruised purples," "velvet applause") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn from despair to booking a new gig feels under-motivated by on-page struggle; the coin and ghost provide external permission more than earned internal shift. Reginald's motivation (eternal encore) is clear but his function remains largely atmospheric rather than applying genuine pressure to Elena's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's skepticism is clearly established early and drives her plan to test telepathic residues, but her interior life flattens into conceptual labels rather than embodied contradiction—"somatic marker," "willowglass hope," and "fractally precise" serve as decorative shorthand rather than lived tension. The choice to devise the light-painting protocol and the blind test show agency, but emotional progression feels schematic: doubt → hope → certainty arrives without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a credible alternative. Theo remains a warm presence without distinct pressure or stance that could complicate her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is declared repeatedly but never tests contradictory impulses in scene. The fossil triggers floating and memory flashes, yet her internal experience remains abstract label-speak ("heart raced," "tingled") without embodied contradiction. The ending gestures toward transformation but skips the micro-choices that would earn it; she floats, narrates, then trains apprentices in summary. Agency collapses into passive reception of visions rather than decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation is declared ("to spin this prophecy into raw possibility") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. His interior reads as poetic narration—"quietly inspired" appears as a repeated label—without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The button-cataloging sequence offers no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; he proceeds methodically without friction or cost until the final hourglass turn, which arrives as assertion rather than earned change. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias displays consistent motivation and embodied scarring, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("unused courage waits") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Lena's doubt is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation reads as predetermined rather than earned by prior causal struggle; Elias walks away because the text declares he is "too burned," not because a visible trade-off forces the choice. The pillbox handoff carries symbolic weight but lacks the felt cost of foreclosing a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The coachman's interior life is established through repeated label phrases ("closely attentive," "ambient awareness," "motivation burned clear") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His decision to unpick and re-stitch the tapestry unfolds without visible cost or competing impulses; the work proceeds smoothly to a tidy resolution. The passenger remains a cipher, adding no relational pressure. Interiority reads as thematic summary rather than lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai's interiority shows some concrete grounding ("potter's hands scarred yet serene," shaping clay), but his motivation remains largely contemplative rather than pressured by contradictory impulses. The "zen-minded" baseline flattens potential internal conflict; we see observation and crafting but no genuine struggle between competing desires that would elevate the final choice. The closure moment—understanding via clay-shaping—feels more like conceptual revelation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible relational or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" appears clearly, but her actions feel more like executing a concept than wrestling with genuine internal conflict. The phrase "wistfully pragmatic" functions as a label rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Mira's vulnerability is embodied through posture and silence, but her transformation from hollow-eyed to tentatively resolved occurs too smoothly without sustained resistance. The gauge-tooth gift lands as a symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clearly stated, but her internal experience remains abstract throughout. The "brittle awakenings" function as a conceptual label rather than embodied contradiction—we're told she has fragile realizations without seeing competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to embrace spectral coexistence feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle; her wings simply "tingle" and she spreads them without dramatized cost or foreclosed alternatives. Therapy-speak like "translate isolation into independence" and "motivation surged" flatten interiority into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to find "the thread that connects all things" remains abstract throughout; her actions are driven by convenient plot mechanics rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The reunion with Theo relies on coincidence (both arrive with matching spirals) rather than earned causality from her choices. Interiority consists largely of poetic labels ("prismatic," "whimsical") without embodied emotion or genuine internal conflict. The final "vow to ghostwrite no more in shadows" arrives as declaration rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to outwit the tricksters is clear, but her interior life remains thin—she's defined by her role rather than contradictory impulses. The final choice to broadcast the counter-signal feels inevitable from the start, lacking the friction of a genuine dilemma. Harlan's faction arrives late and collapses immediately upon hearing the demo, erasing any real test of her stance. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get "pulse raced" and "hope steadied her" but no specific physiological signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's claustrophobia is asserted but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—he simply moves through the nexus despite repeated claims of panic. The "prudently adventurous" trait reads as label-only; his prior mapping is told, not dramatized as a micro-choice that trades safety against discovery. Interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("wistful longing," "rebellious stirring") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "claim" of the key and compass lacks earned tension; no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice accompanies the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's face blindness and motivation are asserted but never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The pivotal blood-daubing feels unmotivated—no prior dramatized struggle between empathy and detachment that this act resolves. The "dormant empathy blooms eternal" arc is told through exposition and therapeutic label-speak ("empathy bloomed eternal," "dormant hearts stirring") rather than embodied contradiction. Secondary figures (Mira's sister, Lance) are placeholder names with no pressure applied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation (honor ancestor, reverse exile) is clear and drives the archive search, but her "nervously confident" trait reads as label-only repetition without embodied contradiction—she trembles yet speaks in "ringing declarations" without cost to either impulse. Internal conflict is declared rather than enacted in micro-choices under pressure. The crew and Dr. Hale appear late as convenience figures; Hale's confession arrives without prior resistance, flattening what could have been a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty") that reads more like thematic echo than character-particular thought. The final vow to follow the trail tomorrow displaces the climactic choice off-page. Backstory about the wife's death and prior vows appears but doesn't sufficiently anchor present micro-choices that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a passive label-only presence throughout. His "perceptively calm" demeanor is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in contradictory impulses or embodied costs. The startup mechanics unfold in summary with no on-page micro-choices; Raoul's retreat happens without visible agency from Elias. The final "discovery" of calm versus chaos is declared rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thorne's motivation to decode glyphs via lucid dreams is clear, but his interior life remains largely functional—witness role without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic choice (sharing dream-data with Lyra) feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle. Lyra's exhaustion is embodied ("shadows under her eyes"), yet both characters deploy therapy-speak labels ("burden," "solace," "healed") without embodied micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final embrace resolves neatly without lingering cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    Thorne's interiority is consistently abstract and declarative rather than embodied—"his guarded nature a fortress," "motivation burned fiercer"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic blood-offering reads as symbolic gesture rather than genuine internal conflict with visible cost; the "guard cracked" moment tells rather than shows fracture through competing wants. The confession reveal provides backstory motivation but arrives as exposition dump rather than through present choices that test his guardedness. Emotional progression from guarded to "unguarded soul" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's root-bound state provides a concrete constraint, and the scar-linking ritual creates embodied action. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") repeated without contradiction or embodied cost. The final choice to restore the covenant feels externalized—she reaches, presses, succeeds—without visible internal struggle or foreclosed alternative that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation—patching soul-holes—is declared but never constrained by competing impulses; she moves through the ritual without hesitation, doubt, or embodied cost until the very end. Internal contradiction is absent: "fiercely gentle" reads as a label rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final worry ("wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's") arrives as afterthought rather than earned friction, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    Harl's motivation (salvaging stories, seeking purpose after loss) is present and drives the final decision to authenticate and create a memorial, but his internal experience relies heavily on label-speak ("longing," "purpose") rather than embodied contradiction. The appraisal ritual ("Composition: 60% cotton...") successfully externalizes his coping mechanism, yet the climactic pivot feels more declared than earned through on-page struggle. The phrase "confidently uncertain" recurs as a tag rather than manifesting in genuinely conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation (understanding spirit-physics) is clear, but his interiority is rendered through abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction. The "kindly methodical" trait remains label-only; no on-page choice forces a trade-off between kindness and method. The closure—planting a seed and whispering thanks—lacks agency cost; the spirit's departure happens off-page, and Elias's final stance is serene acceptance without visible forfeiture. Internal conflict is told ("haunted ambitions transformed") rather than enacted through simultaneous contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The titan-gear librarian's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Elara's internal conflict—archivist versus cartographer—is told as opposition rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene. The smelting ritual performs the character work: "I accept you, whole and halved" reads as external narration of method rather than embodied struggle with visible cost. The final reunion of essence to body bypasses any micro-choice that would reveal Elara's hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to "dissolve the walls between hearts" is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The backstory about Mira is summarized exposition that tells us he "chose duty" without showing the choice or its friction. The climactic act—crowning the node with the pearl—reads as symbolic ritual rather than a decision constrained by competing goods or visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("resolve crystallized") instead of embodied emotion or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interiority is heavily labeled rather than embodied: "raw edges," "fractured lungs," "ghost lingered" telegraph states without micro-choices under pressure. The backstory block (accident, apprentice, bridge collapse) is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening motivation. His graffiti discovery and accordion playing feel illustrative rather than revealing contradictory impulses in action. The final self-forgiveness reads as declared epiphany ("integration—like tape patching bellows") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains a static vessel for ornamental atmosphere rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation is declared ("to find the Library of Unspoken Words") but never tested by on-page friction or meaningful cost—she simply follows clues to success. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("cautious exuberance," "cautious thrill") recycled across beats without embodied degradation under pressure. The final transformation is asserted ("emerged transformed") rather than earned through a renunciation or difficult choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's internal state is declared rather than embodied—"mulberry ache" functions as a label, not a felt contradiction. The inciting choice (dream vs. empire) remains abstract throughout; no on-page moment shows her weighing a concrete cost (e.g., missing a performance deadline, severing a relationship). Her "accidental telepathy" trait is told but never constrains a visible choice with trade-offs. The ending grants her both outcomes ("dream triumphant, yet shared") without forfeiting either path, erasing the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirien's motivation—dimming spark seeking preservation—is told rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. The final decision to infuse her own spark reads mechanically: no visible hesitation, cost-weighing, or embodied fear marks the turn. Internal voice relies on abstract labels ("oblivion's edge," "lucid watchfulness") without character-specific texture or believable degradation under existential pressure. The elder remains a passive prop; no secondary pressure tests Lirien's hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find contentment is present and her decision to exile her kin shows past agency, but her present choices feel predetermined by the mystical hairpin revelation rather than earned through contradiction or struggle. The reincarnation twist ("she was that woman, reborn") arrives without prior ambiguity or internal conflict to resolve. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("purpose ignited," "spirit synced") and the scalloping ritual proceeds without visible hesitation or cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is sparse; the climactic flower-healing reads more as magical procedure than a choice testing her values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    Alex's motivation is declared early but remains static; his "ironclad resolve for revenge" shifts to forgiveness without on-page internal friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation is summarized—"He saw his friend's desperation"—rather than dramatized through embodied struggle. Elias functions as a prop delivering aphorisms ("Certainty is the thief") without visible internal stakes or pressure of his own. The epiphany arrives through exposition, not earned scene work, and the final state lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivations are declared ("premature lines from relentless lab pursuits") but never dramatized through embodied choice under pressure. Voss remains an oracle figure whose boyish-yet-aged body is described but whose internal contradictions never complicate a decision. The trance sequence offers visionary imagery but no micro-choices that foreclose paths or reveal hierarchy of values. The final "ready to vanish and reemerge" reads as summary acceptance rather than earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thren's motivation ("to learn to navigate without moving") is clear and his patience is embodied through decades of vigil, but his interior life remains static—no contradictory impulses act in scene, only serial repetition of the same choice across centuries. The arrowhead's "wandering pulse" is labeled rather than dramatized as a pressure that complicates his desire; his final success feels declared ("knowledge he craved") rather than earned through on-page struggle. The ending grants him his goal without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thorne's motivation ("to find the sacred in the simple") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The unstrapping sequence shows deliberate micro-choices, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("mediocrity," "underachieving") and stock epiphany language ("sacred," "simple") rather than particular embodied perception. The final decision to grasp the keystone lacks visible internal conflict or foreclosed alternatives; power simply "surges" without a felt tradeoff on the page. Emotional progression reads as steady escalation toward triumph without the friction of competing desires or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the key tag, but his interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("heart quickened," "breath caught") and label-only feelings. The final reunion feels unearned—Lira's transformation into "the library's echo" is told rather than dramatized, and no meaningful cost or struggle accompanies her return. Internal conflict is absent; Elias proceeds without contradictory impulses or genuine mistakes that would ground his quest in character-specific flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is asserted repeatedly ("wavelength align with purpose," "quietly enthusiastic") but rarely embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The coins serve as a decision mechanism, yet the stakes of each cast feel ornamental rather than genuinely constraining—no visible cost attaches to choosing one burst over another. Internal conflict is absent; she proceeds methodically without doubt testing her commitment until the final broadcast, which reads more as fulfillment than earned transformation. Embodied emotion is thin: "quiet enthusiasm blooming inwardly" labels rather than dramatizes her state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation to name fears is clear and grief over Lirian's sacrifice provides emotional ballast. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary rather than embodied contradiction—"her chest tightened with distant intimacy" labels rather than dramatizes the tension. The naming sequence shows micro-choices under pressure, but the heartbreak reads more as backdrop than active internal conflict shaping each decision. The final shift to "heartbroken no more" arrives without a visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elowen's "lukewarm" and "earnestly naive" traits are declared heavily but function primarily as labels rather than embodied contradictions that drive micro-choices. His devotion is stated as "brittle" yet never dramatizes a genuine moment where doubt nearly fractures it; the claim "one doubt, and it would crumble" remains assertion. Interior voice relies on recycled stems ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") in a way that flattens interiority into repeated thematic tags. The final "naive heart swelled" repeats label-speak at closure rather than earning the shift through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "spin stories into shared meaning" is asserted but his on-page choices read as patrol and passive observation until Mira arrives. The guilt-driven vigilance is told retrospectively rather than shown through embodied contradiction in scene. Internal conflict is summarized ("guilt had driven him to vigilance") rather than acted simultaneously, and the boyish-Elias memory arrives as backstory dump without altering present tactics until the final exchange. The burning of photographs and handing over the label feel like gestures of resolution without visible cost foreclosing a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to harmonize logic and intuition") but never acts as a lived contradiction in scene—she arranges vials, lights a flame, watches birds, and the problem resolves without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is told ("intuition tugged," "sentimental ache") rather than shown through simultaneous impulses competing in a single beat. The satchel letters and "secretly sentimental" label appear as backstory decoration, never constraining an on-page decision. Embodied emotion is absent; labels like "breath held" and "tears pricked" replace physical sensation, and the final "harmony ignite within" reads as wishful assertion rather than dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (preserving trust) is clear and drives his choice to revise Lena's protocol. His inventive attention to pattern-reading is embodied through the buckle work and scope analysis. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("the watcher's burden weighed heaviest," "pressure mounted") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice is earned but the internal conflict remains somewhat told rather than dramatized through competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kai's motivation (defeating numbness through clone merging) is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist remains passive—seizing the jar and invoking a rite without visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a live path. Elara functions as a cardboard obstacle whose "true fear" is exposed by the Blade rather than revealed through dramatized pressure. No embodied emotion or mistake-driven escalation; the numbness that should complicate his choices is merely label-speak ("numbness fueling resolve").

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation is stated ("to restore that lost laughter") but his decisions never face friction or cost; he simply enacts his ritual without opposition or internal conflict. The spectral household figures are inert props whose "stirring" and "loosening" happen passively in response to his performance. "Mournfully eager" is applied as a label without dramatizing contradictory impulses in action. No genuine flaws complicate his choices, and the ending grants satisfaction without forfeiting a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The feral library guardian's motives (dimensional homesickness, befriending uncertainty) are stated clearly but remain largely abstract. Internal conflict exists ("feral instinct warring with lucid resolve") but reads as declared rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final move—lunging to interiorize the cultist—feels abrupt rather than earned by prior on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates at a high register ("homesickness crested, a wave threatening to drown my vigil") that labels states without grounding them in specific sensation or impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation (interrupting destiny) and the successive approximation attempts show embodied struggle. However, interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "hopelessness had long been his shadow") and the final transformation feels unearned—no prior causality establishes why *this* attempt succeeds when three identical patterns failed. The shift from hopeless to triumphant lacks the internal contradiction or cost that would make the change credible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("find the beginning in every ending") is clearly stated but remains abstract throughout; her expertise is asserted more than dramatized through meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The "discarding assumptions" sequence reads as procedural listing rather than embodied struggle with visible internal contradiction. No credible forfeiture or cost appears on the page—the city simply "revives" without consequence to her stance or capacities. The final "ready for the next whisper" undercuts any sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias demonstrates consistent positive motivation and makes multiple choices under pressure (racing below deck, tuning the radio, turning the hourglass sideways), but interiority relies heavily on label-only traits ("resiliently positive," "ardent heart") rather than embodied contradiction. The parallel-Elias doubling offers a moment of internal friction ("Your pessimism needs my spark"), yet this arrives late and resolves instantly without sustained cost. Emotional embodiment is thin; reactions to the spectral crisis read as narrated enthusiasm rather than lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains abstract throughout—a "fever dream architect" who glides and weaves but never reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "discover connection" is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. Memories "alter" repeatedly but function as atmospheric decoration rather than embodied stakes that force genuine tradeoffs. The final "discovery" is asserted ("he had found what illusions alone could never grant") without earning it through on-page struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kai's motivation is declared but never tested by competing impulses or genuine obstacle; he arrives wanting to learn navigation and simply receives instruction without internal friction. Elara functions as exposition vehicle rather than character with her own stake. The "balanced curiosity" attribute appears only as narrator assertion ("embodied a balanced curiosity") without constraining a single on-page choice. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("heart pounding," "eyes widened") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly ("to protect vulnerable voices") but her choices feel mechanical rather than embodied. The hearing-aid device triggers action through exposition ("she'd traced such links before") rather than dramatized struggle. Clara's suicidal crisis is told in a single line ("Clara had come to end it all") without prior behavioral cues, making the stakes feel imported rather than earned. Internal contradiction is absent; Elara moves through beats as a facilitator without competing impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia is embodied through sweat, breath-fighting, and panic surges, but her interior voice leans toward therapy-speak ("biofield," "phase transitions") that feels catalog-like rather than lived. The motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her choice to phase through walls arrives without visible cost or hesitation that would reveal competing desires. Her colleagues' plight is told in summary ("merging with signals during a botched test") rather than shown through specific memory fragments that would anchor her grief. Minor: "claustrophobia hated this limbo state" abstracts the sensation instead of embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" is clear and her heartbeat-counting trait is consistent, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("midnight solace," "wisdom from failure") rather than embodied contradiction. The closing choice—pocketing the shard and leaving—feels more like completion of a task than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority often summarizes state ("her motivation burned quiet") instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The digital ghost Lir functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thorne's motivation (preserve a dying language through sonic textures) is clear and intensifies across the piece, driving his final action. However, interiority remains abstract—copper veins "pulsing" and "dimming" functions as visual shorthand rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic harnessing feels narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; we're told he "channeled" and "invoked" without visible struggle or tactical adjustment. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the stakes largely internal and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to turn that bitterness into a cosmic joke") but never dramatized through conflicting micro-choices under pressure. The brother's rejection is told in summary, not enacted, so the emotional wound feels abstract. The ending ascent lacks embodied contradiction—she simply laughs and floats, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interior voice converges with the narrator's purple register, flattening character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation ("reawaken beauty") is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on label-only constructs—"fire of her unyielding motivation," "gap between knowing and understanding"—that read as therapy-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic uprooting lacks visible internal cost; she descends and succeeds without facing a genuine trade-off that forecloses a path. The locust shell functions as a talisman but doesn't constrain her action or reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation (mending broken promises via drone network) is established but his choices feel more procedural than driven by lived contradiction. The backstory of the lost bride surfaces but remains ornamental rather than pressuring present action with embodied cost. Internal conflict is asserted ("heart heavier with ghosts") rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. The final letter from her hand arrives conveniently without prior on-page friction that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established through "silent," "quietly persistent," and his muteness vow, but these traits function mostly as labels rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. The climactic choice to "sing" (a wordless hum) feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior struggle; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("interpreting silence as possibility") and the final act reads as epiphany rather than embodied decision under pressure. The restoration sequence shows competence but lacks genuine friction or blind spots that force mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eliza's motivation ("to find that place where narratives breathed independently") is declared but rarely tested by pressure or competing impulses. Her "sanely eccentric" trait is asserted multiple times but constrains no on-page choice with felt cost—she simply performs her ritual unopposed. The patron's cough "shatters the trance" and grounds her, yet no subsequent micro-choice reveals altered tactics or values; she immediately returns to the same plan. Interiority reads label-heavy ("Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely"; "motivation sharpened") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—recapturing her sister's dying dream—is clear and drives the multi-dawn ritual. However, interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("luminous absence," "hollow") rather than embodied contradiction; we see her actions but not conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to enshrine the palette and serve other wanderers feels declared rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a live path. Micro-choices (adjusting exposures, depleting wells) show effort but not a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith character remains largely external and archetypal—"neither tall nor imposing, yet his presence disoriented the air"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The woman's desperation is declared rather than embodied through specific sensory experience or micro-choices under pressure. Internal states are labeled ("improbable longing," "fear") instead of dramatized through embodied perception. The locksmith's final decision to work on his own lock feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to recover stolen memories is clear and his actions follow logically—wading through the flooded greenhouse, kneeling to brush sediment, pressing his palm to the mushroom. The "chronically curious" trait shapes his observational approach but feels label-heavy; interiority leans toward summary ("crisp nostalgia sharpened his resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final restoration of memories provides closure, but the change feels delivered by the fairy ring rather than earned through a difficult internal choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's mentorship motivation is clear and her "combative tenderness" creates consistent internal contradiction, but key interiority relies on stock metaphors ("flutter in her chest," "steel spine," "quiet forge"). The backwards-walking tic is labeled nervous but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Kai's transformation from trembling to resilient feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure; the final test's success arrives without meaningful struggle or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirien's motivation is declared ("preserve the color of wonder") but his internal conflict never materializes on the page—he moves through the ritual without visible struggle, doubt, or cost. Elowen appears as a passive recipient rather than a character under pressure; her "dulled eyes" and "frayed spirit" are labels, not embodied states that shift through dramatized choice. The pruning ritual unfolds as a demonstration piece with no missteps or tradeoffs that would reveal character limits. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("insatiably creative," "radiant hush") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirien's motivation (grounding spirits his brother failed to save) is stated clearly but remains inert; it never creates a visible choice dilemma or cost on the page. His actions follow a single procedural track—unravel, restore, repeat—without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("lucid unrest," "motives deepened") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The shade and released spirits remain functionally identical, never applying distinct pressure or forcing Lirien to weigh competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity and perceptive nature are repeatedly labeled ("methodically curious," "perceptive map framer," "shielded openness") rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. His grief over his father's "vanishing words" is told, not shown to constrain any on-page decision. The descent and keystone moment feel unmotivated—no internal conflict or embodied hesitation appears when he crosses into forbidden ground or reopens the seal. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("tears blurring his vision—not rain, but release") and therapy-speak ("empathizing with the silence") that flatten the emotional texture at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to understand the physics of letting go") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The interior monologue leans heavily on abstract concepts ("quantum surrender," "dark energy") that read as thematic decoration rather than embodied thinking under pressure. Her relationship with "Elias" (Death) is told as backstory without on-page friction or cost. The final choice—releasing the snow globe—feels more like symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elowen's motivation to articulate hidden yearnings is declared and repeated but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Her actions (mixing pigments, positioning the plate, singing) feel procedural rather than driven by internal conflict. The ghost's plea merges with her own balladeer identity too smoothly; no contradictory impulse acts in scene. Interiority leans on abstract labels ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") rather than embodied, character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation ("warmly inquisitive," "affectionate detachment") is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The diary revelation that she is Elowen's child arrives as pure surprise without prior micro-choices testing her curiosity against risk. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart ached fondly") and the final resolve ("tender resolve") is declared, not earned by on-page struggle. The ending choice to "claim the heights" lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (proving empty spaces remember) is established early and drives his continued observation, but his emotional progression feels over-articulated with diagnostic precision ("quietly explosive surge rising in his chest, not sobs but starlit supernova"). Internal contradiction is present (grief versus scientific drive), yet pivotal moments lean toward label-heavy interiority rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously. The final acceptance reads as an arrival rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, though the origami-page release offers a concrete micro-action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's prosopagnosia shapes her artistic method convincingly—she navigates blindness through "fractally precise strokes of posture, gesture, and light." Her motivation to craft the mirror array is clear, and the final choice to complete the work under demolition pressure shows agency. However, her internal experience remains somewhat declarative ("Her blindness, once a cage, freed her") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in peak moments. The renunciation of recognition ("recognizing none of their blurred faces, smiled inwardly") carries thematic weight but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "diligently curious" trait and "sociable isolation" are asserted repeatedly through label-heavy narration ("she chatted amiably to herself," "as was her habit") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her decision to engage the hopscotch board feels like curiosity-on-rails with no internal conflict or cost; she never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible price for her choice. The vanished crew and months adrift are told backstory that don't constrain present action. Interiority relies on stock adventure-apprentice framing without embodied emotion or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to learn "the rhythm of repair" is clear and the final gears-aligning scene shows him enacting choices, but his interior remains abstract—we see longing and "driftwood nostalgia" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The climactic beat ("align the gears to uncap the core") reads more as puzzle-solving than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost; the father's teaching arrives as vision rather than earned friction. Embodied emotion is present ("sweat beaded despite the freeze") yet stock phrasing ("heart quickened") and therapy-adjacent introspection ("patient weave of loss and longing") dilute specificity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The four-person ensemble is introduced through label-only traits ("botanist with callused hands," "mechanic haunted by loss") that never differentiate their speech, perception, or micro-choices under pressure. Internal life is absent; the group acts as a single unit with no contradictory impulses. When Kael grumbles and Mira replies about trust, the lines could swap speakers without loss—voice convergence at the story's sole moment of dialogue. The ending declares bonds "forged in the slow burn of necessity" but no on-page friction or trade-off ever tests individual versus collective desire.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—whispering a lullaby to soothe souls—is clear and emotionally rooted, but his interior life consists largely of abstract memory summaries rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final gesture (singing through the pane, aligning the puppet head) enacts his vow, yet the choice itself feels inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible cost; no competing desire or fear complicates the moment. Backstory dominates much of the middle third without micro-choices that alter present options, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's reluctance and grudging motivation are clearly established and embodied through concrete choices (gathering nuts, positioning them per blueprint). His internal contradiction—hating the duty while driven to atone—operates simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat static; his reluctance returns at the end without visible cost or alteration from the rescue. The final "he'd do it again, cursing all the while" reads as a soft reset rather than earned endurance with foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's core motivation (atone for pollution-driven guilt) is clear and drives the arc, but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("symphonic mind," "dissonant chord") rather than embodied contradiction. The chrysalis moment gestures at transformation but remains declarative ("grief loosened further") without micro-choices that test competing impulses on the page. The final resolve to "craft polymers inspired by foam and silk" arrives as summary rather than a dramatized trade-off with visible cost in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to find "the place where stories begin" drives the ritual, but his interior life relies heavily on quantified absences (14,792 silent dinners, etc.) that read as label-inventory rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to descend is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle between conflicting wants. Emotional states are told through metaphor ("vendor's mask cracking") without visceral embodiment or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elaris's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories smooth" is established early with concrete family-caravan remorse, and his gift of tasting memories provides character-particular interiority. However, the climactic sequence—kneeling, digging, descending, sampling pools, cooking—reads more as a sequence of actions than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to subsume the pavilion's stored remorse is presented as inevitable once discovered rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative path with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears in "trembled slightly" and "chest like lead," but much of the peak experience is filtered through declarative summary ("visions overlaying," "remorse flooded him") rather than immediate sensory contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("bridges from silos") but her interiority reads as label-only: "empathetically decisive" and "vigorous tender" are applied as tags without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The bridge-building montage summarizes her rallying crews and physical work in a single paragraph, flattening what should be fraught decisions into efficient narration. The climactic talk atop the bridge resolves through her choral weaving of languages, but no internal cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—she succeeds without visible struggle or trade-off. Emotional progression is absent; she moves from resolve to triumph without degradation, doubt, or genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to excavate abandoned dreams is declared but never tested by a competing want or visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The transformation is summarized through metaphysical mechanics rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final "vow" arrives without forfeiting a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared but never meaningfully tested by contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. Interior texture leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("prism-minded," "latent blaze") rather than concrete, character-particular thought. The final "clutching the tome" moment asserts transformation without showing a credible choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Therapy-speak and label-only traits ("seeds of vigilance," "prismatic soul") replace dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation is established early and consistent, but his interior life leans heavily on label-like formulations ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") repeated across the text rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final act—strumming the sculpture—proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path; he completes the music and departs satisfied. Embodied emotion is present in "heart attuned" and "callused fingers," but the peak beat lacks a genuine struggle or tradeoff that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established (discover beauty in difficulty, mend covenant) and his chess-tutor precision shapes tactical moves throughout. However, interiority remains abstract and label-driven: "hopeful melancholy," "thoughtfully precise" appear as narrator claims rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—rearranging the board to align king to dent—feels more ritualistic than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost; exile and phase remain unchanged, undermining agency. Emotions are asserted ("melancholy tugging," "hope flickered") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is constructed from labels ("eclectic pacifist," "mosaic of contradictions") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His transformation from battlefield medic to archivist is told in summary without an on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The theatrical addresses to the diary ("Oh, faithful chronicler") perform sincerity rather than embodying it through gesture or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on exposition ("his motivation burned like a votive candle") instead of immediate, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's ambition and sensitivity are established, but her interior remains abstract through much of the piece ("ambition burned like hidden sap"). The final turn—achieving serenity through endurance—is asserted rather than earned by contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied detail appears ("nose aflame," "gagged, vision blurring") but is buried in overwritten texture; the protagonist's choices feel preordained by thematic agenda rather than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (brother's death, withered groves) is clearly stated and drives her risk-taking journey. However, the pivotal closure choice—pocketing the artifact—lacks on-page struggle or visible cost beyond practical consequence; she "knows" it will revive her groves without dramatized doubt or moral calculus. Interiority remains thin: "her motivation burned hotter" is told, and the moment of prying the tip free skips emotional contradiction. The decision feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation ("cultivate foresight in action") remains abstract and told rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The patch object functions as a talisman but doesn't complicate his decision path—he simply continues surveying. Interiority relies heavily on label-only constructions ("his motivation burned clearer") and the final transmitted report feels mechanically resolved without visible internal cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is minimal; the protagonist moves through the labyrinth with steady purpose but no genuine struggle between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elyra's motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is declared rather than embodied through concrete contradictory impulses. Her hesitation is mentioned ("fettered by doubt") but never dramatized as a lived internal conflict that forces a micro-choice with visible cost. The final act—striking the bell—feels mechanically resolved without genuine struggle or earned transformation; she simply "surges" past her doubt. Synesthesia is described richly but remains ornamental rather than creating a credible constraint or mistake under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elaron's motivation is stated repeatedly but rarely tests contradictory impulses in scene. The "weaving between worlds" confrontation with shadow thieves offers one moment of internalized conflict ("confronting the lapse in his watch, the hubris that blinded him"), but the epiphany about isolation arrives as summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract labels—"weight of memory," "wound that festered"—without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal competing desires. The final transformation ("driven no longer by shame, but by gleaned wisdom") reads as declared rather than earned through on-page renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior is dominated by abstract philosophical musing ("mathematics of emotion," "joy equaled sorrow's derivative") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The personality-borrowing trait is asserted repeatedly but never generates a visible internal conflict or cost-driven choice—he borrows Mira's fear, staggers, then the loop resolves without foreclosing options. Mira's terror is labeled and transferred but not dramatically tested; her shift to equation-scribbling feels like a plot convenience rather than an earned transformation. The closure renunciation ("reset the press, ready to print") reads as routine rather than a path foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael's motivation to "coax wonder from routine" is clear and his jittery trait recurs, but interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("jittery nerves steadying with purpose") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("unspoken weariness, hidden dreams"). The exchange with Lira shows micro-choice (offering the pendant), but the character change reads more as thematic statement than embodied cost—"jittery no more" declares rather than dramatizes the shift. Thorne's backstory occupies substantial real estate without always tilting present choices, though it does prime the closure gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a coherent motivation (proving objects absorb emotions) that drives action, and the frost-window revelation creates internal conflict between empiricism and mysticism. The character arc from "firmly grounded" denial to full communion is traced through micro-choices (pressing palm to window, tracing frost, forehead to glass). However, interiority sometimes slips into label-speak ("mystic's attentive gaze," "wonder's truth") rather than embodied contradiction, and the wife backstory feels inserted for emotional weight without sufficient causal integration into present choices. The final vindication moment lacks genuine cost—triumph is complete rather than ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's core motivation is clear but her interiority drowns in abstract labels ("wistful," "latent sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivotal sacrifice at the climax arrives through summary ("her life force dimming, body slumping") rather than a choice under pressure that reveals competing impulses. No secondary character appears to test her stance; the loom and orchard function as décor rather than crucible. The final act reads as predetermined execution of a ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elar's motivation is stated clearly ("to coax resilience from that rubble") but his interior life remains label-driven rather than embodied. The backstory of kin lost in a shaft collapse anchors his drive, yet moment-to-moment choices feel more illustrated than contradictory—he moves through beats methodically without visible internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and return to the forge suggest completion, but no path is foreclosed with dramatic cost; the meek-to-architect arc is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" is signaled but remains abstract through most of the piece. Her "cyclically spontaneous" nature is label-heavy; the trait appears as declaration rather than embodied contradiction that constrains choice. The mentor's confession arrives via parallel-universe exposition rather than dramatized discovery that forces Elara to act differently. The final acceptance—"weave or all unravels"—reads as capitulation to cosmic duty without a visible tradeoff between competing goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to protect the letter chain is legible and his observant nature is embodied in concrete actions (brushing pebbles, reading notes). However, the final choice—pocketing glass, writing a reply, rebuilding the stack—lacks visible cost or internal contradiction under pressure; it reads as a kind gesture rather than one that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. Harlan's thinning frame and cough provide bodily markers, but his arc is compressed into exposition ("been leaving 'em for months") rather than dramatized choice. The piece achieves functional characterization but misses the contradictory-impulses-in-scene standard required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias possesses a clear motivation (shaping a new dawn via ancient shadows) and his choice to redirect the beacon toward summoning darkness is pivotal. However, his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("shadowed elation," "manic glee") rather than embodied contradiction; the laughter functions as a repeated label rather than a particularized physical tell. The protagonist's internal conflict—rote routine versus ambition—is declared more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. No credible cost visibly forecloses a path; the ending grants triumph without felt sacrifice or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's watchful nature is established early and her dye-master training informs perception ("eyes sharp," tracking light shifts), but her interior remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The donor heart's legacy is told more than dramatized through micro-choices; she accepts the magnetism without visible struggle or cost until the climax. The final stance ("listened, no longer puzzled, but enriched") reads as smooth resolution without the contradictory impulses or forfeiture that would make the change feel earned under pressure. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("question quietly explosive") rather than embodied, character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to discover what trees witnessed") is clearly stated, but his interior reasoning remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The deconstruction ritual proceeds methodically without genuine struggle or competing desires; he encounters no friction that would force a micro-choice with visible cost. Emotions are labeled ("feeling the weight," "Elias smiled") rather than enacted through specific physical or perceptual shifts. The astronomer's quantified grief is a clever conceit, but Elias's response to it lacks the contradiction or flawed reasoning that would make his final insight feel earned by his own limits.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's goal—rekindling the realm—is clear, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("scattered memory keeper," "mosaic of fragmented recollections") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The spectral communities are mentioned but never dramatized as individuals with competing needs; they exist as props that conveniently cohere when the song begins. The final "alignment" of memories and the protagonist's shift to "dawn-weaver" feel declared rather than earned through on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's empathy is labeled rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. The young man materializes without earned interiority and exists solely to validate her arc. Her "mistake" is told in backstory without present friction—she already knows what she wants and faces no genuine obstacle to joining. The final transformation ("compassionate recluse no more") is asserted rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life shows purposeful contradiction—guilt over noticing but not acting on the bakery's decline coexists with his guerrilla-gardening dedication—but the resolution with Mira arrives via her sudden appearance rather than a choice forged under pressure. The "I forgive you" moment feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized friction between them on the page. Embodiment is present (bread-breaking, tea-pouring) but much interiority leans on abstract metaphor ("yeast ghosts whispering of persistence") instead of grounded sensory stakes. The climactic reconciliation lacks visible cost; both siblings exit unchanged in their core stance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is stated ("to conjure meaning from that brink") but never tested by a credible counter-desire or trade-off. His "gently meticulous" trait appears as label and gesture ("adjusted his spectacles, fingers tracing") without constraining a choice or exacting visible cost. The final smile and securing of the slide read as summary triumph rather than earned change through contradictory impulses. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; actions follow a single orderly path without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is established early and drives her three attempts, though her internal contradiction—"curiously steadfast" resolve versus "fraying nerves"—reads more as descriptive label than dramatized tension. The micro-choices (approaching Thorne, murmuring to the runner, flashing the fob) show goal pursuit, but the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical across the false starts. The final choice to expose Thorne publicly is earned by prior causality, though the cost (emotional aftermath, what she's forfeited socially) remains understated. Body and emotion are present but lean toward stock pirate-market clichés rather than character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interior contradiction is present—she doubts augments yet relies on her own mods—but the moment of change at the end feels announced rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. The taste-synesthesia is mechanically consistent but deployed as exposition; her skepticism dissolves into "awe" without visible cost or a foreclosed path. The weather-walkers remain label-only presences with no distinct speech or behavior, and the climactic exchange reads as thesis delivery rather than character-driven tension. Interiority leans on stock constructions ("quiet wonder," "luminous skeptic") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to reclaim his art is established and the final choice to sketch anew feels earned. However, the internal contradiction—years of denial versus instant recovery—lacks embodied struggle. The mnemonic gift is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Diagnostic self-awareness ("inescapable calling," "bottled storm") reads as therapy-speak rather than lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trait (wilting near lies) is embodied clearly and her quest for lost conversations motivates the arc. Internal progression from "chasing phantoms" to inscribing truth feels earned by vault discovery. However, the mentor's confession arrives conveniently via vault-leaf rather than through Elara's on-page choice under pressure, softening agency at the climax. Emotional arc reads earnest but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a function of the premise—"harmonious bell tuner" who "preserves wonder"—rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her seasonal muteness is told as backstory and never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. The pilgrims who arrive are generic seekers; the boy's transformation is asserted ("crimson curiosity anew") without embodied struggle. Motivation is declared but not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zeta's motivation—to resolve inner static—is coherent and intensifies under the magnetic shift, but the android's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("nostalgia," "static," "fragments") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to open the box and later miniaturize the chaos reads mechanically; we see goal pursuit but not genuine internal conflict between competing impulses acting simultaneously. The renunciation or containment feels more procedural than costly, lacking visible friction in the decision itself. Micro-choices exist (herding vines, deploying nanites) but their stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation "to prove that listening heals divides" is told rather than shown through internal conflict. The "sandstorm calm" attribute appears as a label repeated three times without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. Secondary characters (Ruiz, Liang, Tomas, Chen) exist only to deliver clues; no relationship pressure or status dynamics emerge. The ending declares bonds reformed ("Tomas embraced Ruiz, feuds dissolving") without dramatizing the prior friction or showing what was risked.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is told ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her choices follow a linear path—descend, retrieve, dance, unlock—without genuine internal friction or cost that would make her struggle credible. The cryo-pod colleagues arrive as convenient plot furniture, not relationships under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("calm defiance," "racing pulse") and therapy-speak abstractions instead of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation—finding deleted memories—is declared but never tested by a competing want or meaningful renunciation. His internal state remains abstract ("heart pounding," "burning motivation") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The wildflowers function as token backstory rather than a live constraint; at closure he simply "reclaims his full past" without visible cost or foreclosed path. The ending grants complete success with no trade-off, flattening any character arc into a quest-completion checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a label-only summoner; his interior world consists of abstract declarations ("tranquil blaze…a calm fire kindling within his chest") rather than embodied contradiction. The piece asserts motivation—"to hush this prophecy"—but never dramatizes competing impulses or a hierarchy of values under pressure. No micro-choices reveal character; the ritual unfolds as choreographed exposition with no friction, mistake, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The ending dissolves into summarized triumph without dramatizing the toll or endurance required.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to learn the building language is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("motivation burned fiercely," "heart raced") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to demand full teaching feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; she interrogates Harlan but we see no cost or hesitation that would make her demand feel earned. Harlan remains a cipher—his "mysteriously familiar" smile and patient manner are labels, not dramatized contradictions. The "agreed upon lies" frame is told rather than shown through competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is labeled rather than embodied—"charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve" function as tags without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The quarantined memory and final archiving follow a determined path with minimal on-page ambivalence; her ritual proceeds without genuine missteps or friction between wants. Embodiment is thin: "tragically radiant tears" and "trembling fingers" rely on stock gestures. The ending choice feels predetermined rather than earned by visible internal conflict that narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation—revenge for abandonment transformed into a quest for release—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final "unlinking" feels like a completed ritual rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost; we see him perform steps but not wrestle with what he's giving up. Interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("wisdom had endured," "catharsis") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The calligrapher's craft never constrains a micro-choice on the page; his skill serves backstory but not present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elyra's core motivation—to learn why some echoes persist—is declared but never tested through difficult choices with competing costs. Her "richly perceptive" trait remains label-only; the text asserts it without showing tradeoffs or consequences in action. The merchant's betrayal and the guardian's stone-web response arrive as summary rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority is abstract ("her motivation crystallized") and the final departure reads as a thematic statement rather than a choice forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions follow a smooth procedural arc—kneel, trace, murmur, peer, analyze, command—without embodied hesitation or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The final retrieval of the locket feels awarded rather than earned by internal conflict. Interiority leans on abstract claims ("motivation burning fierce," "guilt woven into the dream's fabric") instead of concrete, contradictory sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai's interiority is present but abstract ("appreciate the hidden effort," "philosophy unfurled") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The final mending choice feels thematically declared rather than earned by prior pressure—no visible cost or foreclosed path. Emotions are asserted ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") via external labels instead of dramatized in gesture or micro-choice. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure to test Kai's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is declared but his inner contradiction—questioning his own crusade—arrives only in the final third without earlier embodied tension. The reversal from debunker to secret-keeper lacks dramatized cost; he simply walks away with a letter fragment, and the choice feels asserted rather than earned through competing impulses shown in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("sharp observance," "keen gaze") and the epiphany moment reads as convenient rather than causally forced. No secondary character pressures him on the page, removing relational friction that could have tested his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "shape a new dawn" is declared but never tested through competing impulses or meaningful internal friction. His actions follow a linear path from isolation to broadcasting without genuine struggle or trade-offs visible on the page. Mira's "variant allegiance" sabotage arrives and resolves within two lines, offering no sustained pressure or earned cost. The final choice—standing defiant and broadcasting—feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory desires acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to translate generational voices is clear and drives the jar-collecting method, but interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("lonesome splendor," "positively wistful") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to approach the fishers and the grandmother's reaction show stakes, yet the protagonist's internal conflict remains muted—no genuine struggle between competing impulses appears on the page. The final return to the loft reads as affirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to protect the key is declared but never tested by a meaningful choice—he never weighs abandoning it, hiding it, or surrendering it. His "logically emotional" trait is mentioned twice but functions only as a label; no on-page action embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The wraiths appear as obstacles but never force a moral calculus or internal conflict that would reveal character depth. Emotional states are asserted ("heart thundered," "tears carving hot paths") rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is present but largely told through abstractions and mentor wisdom rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The botched scout backstory provides history but doesn't create on-page friction; her climb is technically competent without genuine struggle or degraded perception under stress. Internal conflict reads as alternating summary ("wildness longed to charge… yet Kai's words rooted her") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels predetermined by the setup rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows concrete detail (cataloging algae, loose grate) and her arc from empirical investigator to decisive actor is earned through the lantern catalyst. However, the entangled-memory device creates a convenience: Lila's memories provide motivation rather than Elara wrestling with her own contradictory impulses in real time—the parallel to Marcus is told through flashback comparison rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final choice (hurling the phone, calling for a restraining order) lands with visible cost but arrives via supernatural shortcut. Embodiment is strong in the tunnel beats but thins during the memory overlays, where therapeutic framing ("fortified vulnerability," "armor and wound intertwined") replaces lived sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation (guilt over Marcus) is clear and embodied through concrete memories. The internal conflict between his prior judgment and present remorse drives the repair-shop visit with visible cost. However, the character leans toward retrospective contemplation rather than live contradiction under pressure; his choices feel more dutiful than torn. The final vow arrives as declaration rather than a decision with on-page tradeoff, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "steadily curious" attribute is asserted repeatedly but never forces a difficult choice with visible cost. Her motivation to "ring a bell no one hears yet" remains abstract declaration; we never see her weigh this yearning against a concrete sacrifice or fear. The arrow-tip discovery and algorithm installation proceed without meaningful internal conflict or embodied hesitation. Interiority relies on labels ("irreverent awe," "steadily curious") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and drives her choices, but her interiority leans heavily on descriptive labels ("brightly attentive," "motivation surged") rather than embodied contradiction. The lie and archive access form a credible escalation, yet the final cost—job loss for truth—is asserted in summary rather than dramatized with visible consequences that alter her present stance. Her agency at closure reads as observation more than a choice that forecloses options with felt weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thorne is defined almost entirely through label ("shadow-laced," "calmly intuitive," "courageous anomaly") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The parley features stock diplomatic moves—raising a hand, meeting gazes—without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values or visible cost. The wraith and dryad remain one-note abstractions (isolation, fear) articulated through expository glimpses rather than dramatized friction. Motivation is declared ("map empathy onto action") but never conflicts with a competing want or fear that would force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is established early but remains abstract; her choices—joining the trawl, leaning in to listen—feel observational rather than pressure-driven. The "loose grip on reality" attribute is repeatedly labeled ("She gripped reality loosely now," "her loose grip on reality making her fearless") but never dramatizes a concrete trade-off or mistake that alters her tactics. The parasol tip functions as a talisman but its loss at the breaking point lacks earned causality tied to a prior choice under pressure. Tomas is sketched with black lung and years of waiting, but his presence supplies atmosphere more than immediate relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation (seeking solace after a quarrel) is established, but her internal experience remains abstract—we get "heart echoing," "futile shadows," labels rather than embodied contradiction. Theo is more vivid (calloused hand, vigilant eyes), yet his choices don't alter tactics; he simply recounts his backstory. The ending shift ("not rejection but nature's gentle redirection") arrives as告诉 insight without on-page micro-choices that earn it, and diagnostic phrasing like "intersubjective understanding" and "destined mismatches" intrudes where bodily reaction would ground the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The line walker's motivation ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost. Interiority relies on label-only phrases ("strangely honest heart," "peripheral mastery") rather than embodied contradiction. The prophet and seekers remain functionally inert, offering atmospheric approval but no pressure. No on-page choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "perceptively calm" demeanor is asserted repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her arc from arriving with a map case to completing a mosaic feels executed without visible cost or resistance; the townspeople appear, confess, and heal in a frictionless sequence. The final choice to "walk away" carries no dramatized stakes or forfeiture that would demonstrate what she has renounced or endured. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("earnest whimsy," "calm purpose") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation to decode language growth is clear, but her agency is largely observational until the late testimony scene. The "weathered innocence" trait remains label-only, never constraining a choice or creating internal contradiction. The crystal acts on her more than she acts on it; her reticence dissolves conveniently when testimony is needed. Embodied emotion is thin—tears and gasps appear as expected markers rather than character-particular responses.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows consistent motivation (capturing the sound of aging), but his "precognitively forgetful" trait functions more as decorative label than embodied constraint—visions appear and dissolve without forcing visible trade-offs in tactics. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("tidal longing," "clinging to echoes") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to record the sound reads as fulfillment rather than renunciation with felt cost, and the closing lines ("ready to locate the next echo") soften what could have been a harder-won stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to capture ephemeral phenomena is clear and his final action (etching micro-notches) is embodied, but his interior life relies heavily on repeated label phrases ("luminous ache," "sage") rather than contradictory impulses shown in scene. The key choice to calibrate by leaf-fall is dramatized but feels more craft-puzzle than character crisis; we see competence under pressure without genuine blind spots or costly mistakes that would reveal deeper flaws. The emotional progression is asserted through phrases like "luminous ache swelling" rather than embodied through perception and micro-choices that narrow options with visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" is signaled early, but her agency consists mainly of staging and witnessing rather than facing genuine internal contradiction. The vinyl fragment prompts Harlan's memory work, yet Elara's role remains facilitative—she hymns, wafts scent, and steps aside—without a visible cost or foreclosed path for herself. Harlan's arc (estrangement to reconciliation) carries the weight, but his interiority is thin; Lena arrives on cue with minimal resistance. Embodied emotion appears in "tears carving paths," yet much of the affect is labeled ("serene grace," "decisively kind") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara reads as a role rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her motivation ("to find where shadows went at noon") is declared but never tested by competing desires or costs that force visible trade-offs. Interiority consists largely of exposition and task description ("She had pored over tomes for months") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final "smile faintly" and decision to descend arrive without prior contradiction or renunciation that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation shifts repeatedly without visible cost or contradiction: she dismisses magic, then discovers belief, then becomes a healer of fae-swapped souls, all in summary. The final "setting" of the tooth reads as metaphor without embodied struggle. Interior voice relies on therapeutic abstractions ("forgiveness," "innovation," "yearning") rather than concrete choice under pressure. No moment dramatizes her wrestling with genuine doubt; the arc is told.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (share light without fire) is clear and rooted in backstory trauma, but her interior life relies heavily on label-only emotion ("resurfacing memories," "yearning") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The polishing work shows goal-directed action, yet the final choice—holding the gem and sharing it with villagers—feels more like fulfillment of a declared plan than a decision that forecloses a credible alternative path with visible cost. Backstory dominates (~35% of the text) but anchors to present stimuli (mist, sea glass) and micro-choices (polishing strokes, venturing at dawn), meeting the BRR reflection-led exception; however, the sheer volume still flattens present-tense pressure in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to graft new meaning onto them") but the character functions more as a vessel for thematic language than as a mind under contradictory pressure. The exchange with Kai lacks internal conflict—she proffers the pendant without visible hesitation, foreclosing no competing impulse. Micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values are absent; the action reads as preordained by the thematic design rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("watchful dreamer," "protected vulnerability") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivations are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "battlefield between the urge to abandon it and the fire to see it solemnized" is told exposition; his micro-choices (lifting the seashell, murmuring vows) feel ritualistic rather than rooted in genuine internal conflict. The cameo figures are pure symbolic conveniences that do not test his stance with genuine friction. The final "whole" state is asserted without visible cost or trade-off foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and drives her nocturnal tinkering, but her agency remains largely unopposed—she sings, the loom works, the village awakens, problem solved. Internal contradiction is absent; she's whimsical throughout with no cost that tests her resolve or forces a trade-off between competing values. The villagers' sudden participation feels convenient rather than earned through dramatized resistance or misunderstanding. Her final pocket coil reads as sequel setup rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lir's motivation (translating Eira's heartbeats) is clear and drives action, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The extended patience demonstration ("pressing his palm flat against the frozen earth for what felt like hours") reads as illustrative rather than emerging from conflicting impulses under pressure. His grief and determination are asserted through lyric description, but we never see him waver, doubt, or face a micro-choice that reveals competing values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is established through occupation and "reflective by nature," but his interior life remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" is declared rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Peripheral focus is labeled but never forces a visible trade-off or mistake. The ending ascent feels like closure by assertion ("wonder stored for later") without embodied cost or a choice that forecloses a meaningful path.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation to collect burdens is declared but never tested by a contrary want or genuine inner conflict. The "boundary-less trap" and her realization arrive through metaphysical mechanism rather than embodied choice under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"whalebone reverie," "essence toward the altar"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act of orienting the burner reads as puzzle-solving, not a foreclosure with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete—grief channeled through woodworking, memories crystallized in quartz—and her micro-choices (selecting tools, each chisel cut) serve the dominant drive. However, the characterization leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; her progress from blank to locket is linear, without genuine friction or risk of failure. The final choice (snapping the locket shut) feels procedurally inevitable rather than a renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted by the lyric register; no moment forces her to balance competing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivations are established (reclaim lost youth, negotiate with his ghost), but his interior life remains abstract and label-heavy ("ambitions eroded," "regret coiled"). The ghost confrontation at the climax delivers labels rather than embodied contradiction—"You eroded us" reads as thesis, not lived interiority. Micro-choices are present (cranking the wheel, offering it to the ghost) but feel mechanical rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; he simply steps back and descends with "ambitions reborn," which undercuts the earned-stasis logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's engineering motivation is established early and her micro-choices (splicing lines, routing water, adjusting the sextant) track consistently. However, interiority remains largely functional rather than contradictory—her "stoic wonder" and "functionally creative" mindset feel like stable labels rather than impulses in tension. The final moment lacks embodied cost; she simply "stood back, breath even," then walks out with "equations for hope etched in her mind"—more summary than felt renunciation or gain. Competence overwhelms struggle, flattening the stakes of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life is densely rendered through embodied detail (the music box "weight both burden and balm"), and his introverted retreat from melody to clockwork is causally traced. However, the climactic realization—"his solitude had been the dream's quiet evolution, not its grave"—arrives as therapeutic epiphany rather than earned through contradictory on-page choice under pressure. The final acceptance reads conceptually clean but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply winds the box and returns lighter, which flattens agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains an abstraction throughout—"errant legend seeker" label never translates into contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "trained instincts" and "thoughtfully clear mind" read as competence assertions rather than embodied struggle; no genuine risk of failure shapes his salvage operation. The final smile and "understanding complete" flatten into epiphany without visible cost or path foreclosure. Interiority consists of stock folklore-seeker claims ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity") recycled across beats without differentiation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve ancient methods is clear and consistent, and his patient approach is embodied through his actions with the rope. However, his internal life remains largely summarized through philosophical asides ("preservation demanded communion, not conquest") rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. Kael functions adequately to apply immediate pressure, but the relationship resolves too smoothly without testing Elias's values with a meaningful sacrifice. The final choice to teach Kael's son feels declared rather than earned through on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is present but relies heavily on abstract phrases ("geography of healing," "wounds etched themselves into landscapes") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to heal his sister's absence is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The obituary-writing conceit suggests internal work, but the final "whole" declaration reads as unearned epiphany without visible cost or competing impulse acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elarion's motivation to reawaken beauty is declared but remains abstract; his assembly sequence shows actions without internal contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment—holding the flawed bird while vowing to nurture it—lands as acceptance, but the prince's emotional arc reads as linear devotion rather than contradictory drives under pressure. Interiority relies on repeated label-only constructions ("hypothesizing," "quaking") without embodied particulars that reveal character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is stated early but her choices feel constrained by the grafting procedure rather than internal contradiction. The backstory (father's arson, her burns) is told rather than pressuring present action—it anchors her purpose but doesn't force a visible trade-off on the page. Embodied emotion appears in "callused hands" and "gracefully alert," but these remain labels; no moment shows her struggling with fear, doubt, or a competing impulse during the graft. The ending whisper "Sing for us both" and the line about "father's shadow fading" declare resolution without dramatizing the cost of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is labeled "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" but these traits function as ornamental descriptors rather than embodied contradictions that drive choices under pressure. Her "skepticism flared" is asserted without cost, and her patient waiting lacks genuine struggle or competing impulses. The motivation to "liberate trapped memories" remains abstract throughout; we never see her wrestle with doubt or pay a personal price that would validate the journey. Interior life consists largely of observation and label-based emotion rather than contradictory drives acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her sentimentality is asserted ("boundless well that both sustained and sorrowed her") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The gear-embedding decision arrives without visible internal conflict or a hierarchy of values being tested. The fledgling's response at the end is observed rather than driven by Elowen's agency with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly established—decades of carving epitaphs drive his quest to understand collective grief's geometry—but his interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("fiercely meditative," "thoughtful and deliberate") rather than embodied contradiction. The spectral encounters with family members operate more as exposition delivery than genuine pressure on his choices; he follows instructions without internal resistance or cost until the final realization. The closing turn—seeing grief as a woven tapestry—arrives as an epiphany granted by specters rather than earned through on-page struggle, and his tears feel more like a stock emotional marker than a character-specific response rooted in prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear—penance through precision—but his interior life relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("searing reverie," "ethically diligent heart") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic pause trades embodied choice for a vision sequence where inscriptions do the work, reducing agency to passive reception. The final "emerged—whole" declaration tells rather than shows the renunciation's cost, and the therapy-speak ("incremental absolution," "shared balance") flattens what should be urgent internal conflict into conceptual ledger-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined entirely by label-only traits ("blithe," "contentedly") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. His motivations are told ("to discover the shape of intentions") but never dramatized through on-page conflict or cost—he simply performs his ritual without struggle. The climax (untangling threads) proceeds mechanically without resistance, micro-choices, or visible tradeoffs. The "noblewoman's exoneration" resolution arrives via summary exposition rather than earned internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is introduced with a clear occupation and motivation, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The piece tells us he "must prevail" and that "doubt clawed at him," yet we never witness contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—only declarative emotional states. The final "smile" and assertion that he "prevailed" arrive without dramatized cost or visible struggle that would earn the transformation. Diagnostic label-speak ("groundedly imaginative," "predictive modeling") replaces embodied emotion at peak beats, triggering baseline penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to teach dust storytelling is established but remains abstract throughout; her micro-choices (tuning the radio, singing lyrics, copying scores) repeat without internal contradiction or escalating cost. The interiority relies heavily on thematic declaration ("she believed, dust held the oldest tales") rather than embodied tension. Her triumph when receiving a response lacks prior struggle or visible trade-off that would make the moment earned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to crystallize fleeting emotion is concrete and drives the ritual action. His interiority shows selective memory work ("omitting the bitterness of her decline") that reveals character-specific processing. However, the mask removal at the end feels gestural rather than earned by contradiction, and the internal debate ("had he truly captured her, or merely the mirage") arrives too late to complicate the preceding beats. Embodied emotion is present but the final questioning undercuts rather than deepens the cost already paid.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is defined by label ("rationally rebellious," "wannabe philosopher") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. His agonizing is asserted repeatedly ("began to agonize," "agonized there," "agony twisted anew") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal competing drives. The final "resolution" (fusing the cog, deciding to "surface not to convert but confront") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; he simply executes his plan. Internal voice relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("Rebellion rationalizes truth") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by on-page choice that forecloses a path with cost. The choir members (Joren, Lira, the scholar) are sketched in single traits—"gravel and rage," "sly contempt," "doctrinal weeds"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending declares transformation ("No hatred lingered") rather than dramatizing a final choice or renunciation that carries visible cost. Interiority remains abstract and label-only: "expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "harmonious teaching" recur as decorative tags without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's trait of tasting memories is label-heavy but does motivate the planting choice. The "informally wise" attribute appears mostly as voice flourish ("Life's like a bad stew") rather than constraining decisions with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves smoothly from reflection to action without genuine struggle or competing impulses that would complicate the peak choice. The final act (planting and first harvest) feels earned by setup but lacks embodied emotional cost—no visceral fear, doubt, or physical toll dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's curse provides strong motivation and is embodied through physical compulsion ("the truth surging unbidden," "curse clawed deeper"), but his internal contradiction—hating his curse while using it to preserve wonder—never generates on-page friction that costs him something in this encounter. Mira functions primarily as a receiver; her "sharp-eyed technician" role and grease-streaked overalls are props rather than drivers of choice. The lacquer-box workaround feels convenient rather than earned through prior struggle, and the ending smile suggests resolution without visible cost or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias exists as a concept vessel rather than a person under pressure. His motivation is declared ("burning need to understand") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal cost. The "sanctification" ritual proceeds without friction, error, or genuine struggle—he simply performs actions that succeed, culminating in a community transformation that feels asserted rather than earned. No visible personality, blind spots, or trade-offs emerge; he operates as a benevolent mechanism dispensing shards of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—outrage shifting to nuanced understanding—is present but operates primarily through Thalor's telepathic delivery rather than her own struggle. The ancestor's complexity emerges via exposition rather than Elara wrestling contradictory evidence on the page. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("bubbles erupting from her gills," "clenched her fists") but is overwhelmed by abstract interiority ("certainty a anchor dragging her down"). The final gesture of touching Thalor's hand and surfacing with "resolve to thread nuance" reads as declared rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is defined by labels ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The motivation to "capture the texture" of a missed leap remains abstract; the die-rolling and equation-sketching feel decorative rather than embodying genuine internal conflict. The ending renews the climb without visible cost that forecloses a path—he pockets the chipped die and resumes, which reads as stasis without the felt price required for Earned Stasis. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("heart pounding in timeless rhythm") and the backstory of the ledge/love choice arrives late, told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is driven by clear motivation (proving kindness endures) and his insomnia is embodied through trembling fingers and methodical hope. The final shift to sleep is earned by the night's revelations and the ripple of small acts below. However, interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("methodically hopeful," "primal warmth") and the visions function more as exposition than contradiction-driven choices under pressure. The stranger who fed him and the night-shift worker are mentioned but never tested on the page, weakening relationship-as-crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior landscape remains flat—she clutches the lens, declares intent, commands action, yet we never glimpse contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The displaced persons function as a mass rather than individuals who apply relationship pressure. The bread-baking ritual arrives late and resolves too neatly without visible cost that forecloses a path; the ending shift to the opera house reads as convenient relocation rather than earned renunciation or alteration with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interiority relies on label-only declarations ("bleak exhilaration," "neatly inventive") rather than embodied contradiction. His choice to reverse fate is asserted more than dramatized through micro-decisions under pressure. The final sacrifice reads as predetermined by the setup rather than emerging from genuine internal conflict. Body and gesture remain generic—"heart pounding," "eyes gleamed"—without character-specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes mid-story ("to trick Fear"), but her interior life is overwhelmed by ornamental horror imagery rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The suicide confession arrives late without prior embodied struggle, reading as a reveal rather than earned psychological erosion. Emotional states are labeled ("Terror gripped her") instead of enacted through perception and micro-choices. The final walking-away lacks visible cost—her "repulsive allure" persists as decoration, not a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen's motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is declared but never tested by internal conflict or embodied contradiction. His actions are competent and sequential, yet no genuine struggle emerges—he grins fiercely, leaps, strikes, and succeeds without visible cost or foreclosed paths. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("restlessness gnawed," "motivation burned deep") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final slump reads as fatigue, not as a renunciation or shift earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "quietly driven" motivation is asserted repeatedly but rarely dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her choice to blow the whistle reads as mechanically advancing plot rather than emerging from internal conflict—no visible struggle between caution and obsession. The ending's tumble and realization summarize consequences without showing a foreclosed path or micro-choice with felt weight. Interiority leans on label-like phrasing ("quietly driven," "dread pooling like sweat") instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's "emotionally rational" trait is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The silent weeping while cataloging ledgers gestures at embodied conflict, but most decisions flow linearly without visible internal friction. The grandfather revelation arrives late and adds motivation by assertion rather than complicating prior choices. His final sense of wholeness reads as declared rather than earned through on-page renunciation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation is declared ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") but never genuinely tested on the page; he performs a solo ritual without meaningful internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. Emotions are labeled ("stoic shiver," "quiet tears") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The interiority relies on therapeutic abstractions ("sensitivity fueling his precision") and the final "transformation" is asserted rather than earned through a choice under pressure. No secondary character is present to create relational friction, and the protagonist's competence never encounters genuine struggle that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (trace honest origins) is signaled and pursued, but interiority relies heavily on recycled descriptors ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. Her discovery sequence shows logical method-testing, yet the final vault choice carries minimal felt cost—she "sat amid the reclaimed stillness" without dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is thin; no sweat, tremor, or visceral hesitation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elar's grief motive is clear and his crafty identity established early, but his interior reads as label-heavy ("luminous torment," "grief's weight") rather than contradictory impulse dramatized in real time. The final crane-folding sequence demonstrates embodied choice under pressure, but the path there leans on abstract emotion tags—"radiant agony," "torment flaring brighter"—instead of concrete sensory perception that would anchor his mind. Micro-choices exist (selecting gems, folding cranes) yet the progression feels more decorative than driven by competing wants colliding in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—survivor hunting power from wedding rubble—is clear and consistent, and her scars provide embodiment. However, interiority leans toward label-speak ("bleak exhilaration," "unused potential") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "seal the crystal" and "return, again and again" reads more as declaration than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. Backstory is present but does not tilt a present micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode belonging reads clearly and drives her choice to activate the drones and pull the lever. However, the pilgrim's "perpetually surprised" face is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates friction. His transformation from surprised to peaceful arrives without embodied cost—tears appear, but no on-page trade-off emerges. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("her own ache," "mending her pilot's isolation") rather than character-particular contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation (unearth truth vs. manufacture lies) is clear and his regret is embodied through physical moves (sifting driftwood, pocketing the watch hand). However, his decision-making feels more contemplative than contradictory under pressure; the internal conflict is told through backstory loops rather than shown in competing impulses within the present scene. The reflection about his mother and his own buried lineage (~20% of the text) anchors to present stimuli but flattens present-tense choice friction. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, sifting, pocketing) but they observe and process rather than alter immediate options until the final vow, which reads as declaration rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated (recycle mistakes into wisdom) but her interior life relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's capture and her past deception are told rather than shown through present micro-choices that reveal cost. Kael appears as a functional counterpart but lacks distinct interior texture; their exchange reads as parallel monologues rather than a relationship under pressure. The final "true prisoner freed was her conscience" is label-only resolution without dramatized struggle in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to "align heart and action" is clear, but his internal contradictions operate sequentially rather than simultaneously in scene. The backstory of failed voyages and family abandonment is told rather than embodied through present micro-choices under pressure. The final beach moment gestures toward change, but the path from drunken kayaker to whispered wisdom feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present in "muscles protesting but alive" and "tasting brine and folly," yet peak beats rely on label-speak ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith") without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Jax's motivation to help Elara kindle empathy is clear, but his interior life reads generic—"jaded wonder," "clean slate," and "motivation crystallized" are labels rather than embodied contradiction. The neural wipe setup never constrains a present choice; backstory dominates without micro-choices that tilt present stakes. Elara's tear at the end arrives without prior dramatized resistance, making the change feel declared rather than earned through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's grief is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The metamorphosis is told via physical changes ("fur sprouting," "claws forming") without internal conflict beyond a single "reluctance" label. The fortune cookie operates as pure convenience—no dramatized struggle over whether to trust it, what price to weigh, or what she fears losing beyond the abstract "humanity." Thorne materializes as reward without cost; no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirien's core motivation—to recover stolen time—is clear and drives her to the glade, but her choices there feel largely performative rather than pressured. The birth context adds embodied stakes (blood loss, nursing infant), yet the cartomancy ritual unfolds without genuine internal conflict or cost-laden hesitation. The "willingly perplexed" attribute is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible tradeoff. The final winding of the clockwork into swaddling is a symbolic gesture rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's "steadfast pacifist guardian" motivation is declared but never tested by a competing impulse on the page. The shadow-integration premise—confronting rage, guilt, envy—is told through summary interiority ("the first shadow emerged—a snarling echo") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (piercing the dimensional lock via tapestry) feels unmotivated by prior agency; she completes a ritual sequence without visible internal cost or foreclosed path. Therapy-speak labels ("shadow work," "integration," "alchemical") replace specific emotional perception throughout peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's philanthropic impulse is established early, but his interior life remains abstract—"yearned to understand the texture of transformation" never translates into contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The climactic release of the bugs is accidental ("uncorked the bottles accidentally as a gust from the volcano snatched the satchel"), undermining agency at the pivotal beat. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority reads as poetic summary ("purpose solidified, drawing him from giver to guide") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The widow and child appear healed without on-page cost to Elias beyond his prior destitution, so the transformation feels declared rather than earned through foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (silent revolution against Overwardens) is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost on the page. Her "calmly inventive" trait appears as label rather than constraint—no moment shows invention failing or calm masking panic under pressure. The final paragraph's "Elara smiled, sentinel eternal" reads as static competence rather than character arc with foreclosed paths. Interior voice relies on generic phrases ("heart steady," "lips quirked") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation (to understand sacred patterns and fulfill his wife's promise) is clear and drives his actions throughout. The precognitive curse is shown through visions that torment him, though the embodied experience of these flashes could be more visceral—they're often told rather than dramatically rendered. His final transformation from "elusive no more" to "the pattern, woven whole" reads as label-heavy rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The eels function more as symbolic mirrors than agents that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias remains a label-only cipher: "furiously tranquil" is declared repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivations are told ("to understand the cartography of scars") but never dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The envelope discovery and response proceed without internal friction or trade-offs, flattening what could be a charged moment into pure aesthetic posture. The final "vanishing into mist" offers no earned change or credible endurance with foreclosed paths—he simply continues doing what he already did.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation ("turn questions into destinations") is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a conflicted choice with visible cost. The mechanical arm remains a static prop rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves through decorative philosophical declarations without genuine struggle or trade-off. Lang appears only to yield conveniently, offering no sustained pressure that would test Elias's hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's monthly personality molt is labeled but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the "architect self" functions identically to any determined character. Mira appears suddenly without embodied introduction or contradictory impulses under pressure. The friendship forming while sorting books is told in a single line rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy. Internal voice relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("luminous fracture," "forge beauty from anarchy") that read as thematic echo rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is established early through the frozen clock and his wife's loss, but his interior life consists largely of abstract longing labels ("steely longing," "wistful") rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery-to-action sequence is motivated, yet pivotal beats—deciding to leave the station, climbing the arbor—are narrated as summary rather than lived choice under pressure. The final "smile" and "fingers poised" gesture reads as convenient satisfaction without visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (rigging the projector, navigating by reflected moonlight) but the ending renunciation or transformation remains asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's role as "reality checker" is label-only; her choices at key moments (planting the seed, entering the dream) feel mechanical rather than motivated by contradictory impulses. The Guardian awakening reads as a summoned solution rather than earned through her agency. Internal conflict is asserted ("doubt shadowed her luminous path") but never dramatized as simultaneous opposing desires in action. The final "luminous doubt" is told rather than embodied in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("the color of unspoken apologies") but never internally contradicted or tested by competing impulses. Her actions—pruning, breathing—are symbolic gestures without visible cost or choice architecture; the "severance" with Tomas remains backstory label. Hiroshi is a static guide whose "slow-spoken" trait appears as repeated descriptor rather than constraint. Emotional states are labeled ("cerulean regret," "grief") rather than embodied through contradictory perception or choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative; her expectant resignation and the choir members' transformations are earned through concrete micro-choices, such as Joren's rage softening, with visible cost in their unlearning.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his ability to taste memories is concretely embodied and drives key choices, such as pruning to free memories, earning the closure with visible cost in his effort and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving his choice to use the lacquer box. His involuntary truthfulness constrains actions and adds cost, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving higher-stakes choices; interiority is concrete and embodied, as seen in his "burning need to understand." However, lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, preventing a higher score. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but emotional progression is somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's interiority is concretely embodied through physical reactions like clenched fists and gill bubbles, with internal conflict dramatized as she resists then accepts nuance. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, and the final renunciation of vengeance for nuanced resolve is earned by the cascading revelations, with visible cost in her transformed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's grim optimism is consistently embodied through micro-choices like dice-guided proofs, and his endurance at closure feels earned by prior causality with visible cost—the staircase's reformation. However, minor abstraction in capturing "texture" slightly limits concrete interiority under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal his "methodically hopeful" trait. His internal conflict between doubt and hope drives the narrative, and the final sleep is earned through his artistic revelation, with cost legible in his drowsiness and the city's responses.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to rescue dying arts is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like the baking ritual and flight. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and emotions sometimes rely on abstract phrases like "rosewater dread" rather than embodied specificity. Her final decision to flee is earned, but the lack of deep flaws or contradictory impulses limits the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his internal conflict between exhilaration and cost is embodied, and his final sacrifice is earned by prior causality. The trait "neatly inventive" is demonstrated through on-page actions like dissecting the yoyo, reinforcing character consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to trick Fear is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like using the clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elowen's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is clear and drives the plot; his fierce grin and relentless dubbing under pressure reveal character through micro-choices. Interiority is embodied in restlessness and exhaustion, with cost legible at closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; final endurance is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot with embodied emotion, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped, lacking simultaneous opposing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's emotionally rational trait is consistently embodied in micro-choices like decoding the microscript with balanced sorrow and logic, and his personal stake (grandfather's death) deepens motivation. The final resolution feels earned by prior causality, though his rationality occasionally borders on diagnostic clarity in peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. His stoically sensitive nature is embodied through actions like enduring the cold water and placing notes with quiet tears. The final choice to archive dreams is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his physical struggle. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, with no strong simultaneous impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in logical yet conflicted traits; her dappled resolve and shift to alternative hypothesis show embodied interiority under pressure. The final realization of human hubris is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her logical foundation shifting. However, her competence slightly overshadows deeper flaws, limiting the emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elar's grief-driven motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His craftiness informs key actions, and the transformation feels earned by prior causality, though minor diagnostic language ("luminous torment") appears but is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in her trauma, with embodied emotion like scars burning with memories. Her final choice to become "sovereign of the unseen" is earned by prior causality, though minor stock phrasing ("ghosts from that blood-soaked altar") slightly limits interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her isolation, driving her to help the pilgrim; her micro-choices under pressure, like activating the drones and pulling the lever, reveal her values. The pilgrim's perpetually surprised trait is consistent but slightly one-note, though it influences his urgency. Both characters undergo earned changes with visible cost—Elara finds belonging, the pilgrim finds peace—but the pilgrim's interiority is less developed.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's guilt is concretely embodied and drives micro-choices like sifting driftwood; his final renunciation of deception is earned by causal discoveries, with cost legible in "tempered regret lingered, not as torment, but as a quiet vow." Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in past mistakes, driving her to recycle errors into wisdom. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as tracing the drawer pull.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His merrily melancholic attitude and internal conflicts are dramatized in scene, such as laughing while facing regrets, and his final alignment of heart and action is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jax's motivation to kindle empathy in Elara is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final change—Elara's tear and their shared path—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional breakthrough. However, Elara's shift from "flat as polished obsidian" to empathy feels slightly abrupt, though anchored in the baseball and lake's illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond with Thorne is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like cracking the fortune cookie.

However, the emotional depth feels slightly streamlined for the word count, lacking prolonged contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirien's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's pacifism and motivation are clear, driving the narrative with interiority shown through shadow work; however, some emotions like "ghostly resolve" lean slightly stock, though micro-choices under pressure reveal consistent values.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot through his selfless actions; his transformation is earned with visible cost as purpose solidifies, though some interiority edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like decoding the sundial and sparking the revolution. Her calmly inventive trait is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning the quill holder. However, some interiority edges toward telling rather than showing, like "her motivation burned quiet," slightly reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his wife's promise and precognitive curse, driving his actions with embodied emotion. His internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as pushing through visions of failure, reveal a hierarchy of values. The transformation from curse to blessing feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his final laughter and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. His "furiously tranquil" state shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, and his final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he understands scars as communal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" is clear and drives key choices; his mechanical arm and the coded deciphering reveal character under pressure. The alliance shift with Lang feels earned through prior causality and the duel's cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like gears whirring, and micro-choices under pressure show hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's monthly molt and motivation to forge beauty from anarchy are clear and intensify under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like shedding personalities and planting seeds. Mira's sharp characterization complements his, and their friendship forces choices that alter their state. The final rebuild and resistance are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in their efforts. However, internal contradictions could be more simultaneous in scene rather than sequential summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in steely longing, driving his actions from decoding the film to the journey. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though some phrases like "steely resolve" edge toward stock. His final choice to play in the refuge is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the clock's chime.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (doubt vs. determination) acting in scene. Her final choice to awaken the Guardian is earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible in her lingering doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and raw, rooted in her severance from Tomas, compelling her quest. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "cerulean regret pooling in her chest." Her transformation is earned through on-page actions like pruning the bonsai, showing micro-choices under pressure. However, some emotional beats edge toward abstract therapy-speak, slightly reducing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s profession, loss of her observatory, and attraction to the butterflies’ quiet resilience create a coherent, particular motivation that tracks through her choices. Her shift from spectacle-seeking to humility is legible and grounded in events (the dust’s effects, the reborn data). However, internal conflict is under-dramatized—her previous attachment to “drama” is mostly told rather than felt in specific, resisting impulses. The final stance feels a bit declarative rather than earned via contradictory on-page pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motive (protecting the canyon and finding “purpose in the pauses”) is clear and her actions align with it, especially in using the ledger and frost to hunt the smugglers. Her competence as an artist-warrior is vivid but borders on frictionless; the attack, investigation, and final confrontation rarely expose genuine inner contradiction or doubt. Emotion is mostly conveyed through elevated diction rather than sharply embodied, character-specific reactions. Her transition to “canyon’s guardian” feels earned conceptually but under-dramatized in terms of on-page cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim music from a soundless world and her father’s lost violin—is clear and carries cleanly into her actions with the forks and Kai. Her interiority is more archetypal than idiosyncratic, relying on broad terms like “resilience” and “loss” rather than specific contradictory impulses in the peak beat. Kai’s rage and grief are efficiently sketched and his turn toward “teal resolve” is plausible but a touch too tidy. The final change—Elara shifting from solitary survivor to facilitator of others’ healing—feels earned, though the emotional cost remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—exhaustion with endless burials and a fierce desire to secure true rest—is clear and consistent, and it drives every major choice. His “inadvertent stubbornness” shows up in his refusal to yield to the pressure and the spirits as he works, culminating in his final sacrifice. Internal contradiction (seeking stillness yet becoming a perpetual beacon) is strong but more implied than deeply dramatized in his moment-to-moment interiority. A touch more embodied emotional texture under peak stress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—the desire to turn anonymous aid into a durable, intergenerational ethic—and her actions track well from that core. However, she faces little genuine internal conflict; her stance never wavers, so we don’t see competing impulses in her under pressure. Tomas, Lena, and the elders function mostly as foils/supporters rather than fully pressured individuals. The final endurance of her legacy is emotionally satisfying but feels more ordained than wrestled into being.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation (to follow sparks and recover “unused love”) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his decision to use Kwan Yin’s tear with the camera obscura feels character-specific. However, his interior conflict is muted—he moves from curiosity to insight with little real doubt, fear, or moral friction on the page. Mira registers more as a vessel for the healing motif than as a fully individuated presence. The closing realization is earned but comes with limited sense of personal cost or unresolved contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession with the “texture of time” is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, especially his decision to risk using the halo fragment on the fading photograph. His grief over his wife and the retrocognitive torment give him credible contradiction: he’s both unable to let go and desperate to escape the past. Interiority is specific and embodied via tactile engagements with vines, moss, and photographs rather than generic emotion labels. The final release—freedom at the cost of the photographs and fragment—feels earned by the prior characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (smuggling seeds to the exiles) is clear and consistent, and her competence under pressure reads convincingly. However, she’s almost entirely without on-page contradiction or doubt, so we miss the friction of competing impulses. Interiority is relatively thin and often summarized rather than embodied, which keeps her from feeling fully particular. The final choice to escape with the seeds is earned but emotionally undertextured, with little visible personal cost beyond danger.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, sensory quirk, and trauma are specific and well-motivated, and his emotional life is vividly embodied (“cells divided in his regenerating flesh…mitotic fire”). His drive to capture the sound of trust breaking is clear and consistent. What’s missing for the very top tier is an on-page moment where contradictory impulses actually collide in a choice—he never seriously wavers or considers another path. The relationship with the partner is powerful but entirely offstage, so its complexity can’t deepen in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation (stealing golden-hour portraits to hear destiny) is clear, specific, and consistently enacted, and her competence in decoding cues feels lived-in. Internal experience is mostly filtered through perception and metaphor rather than nuanced contradictory impulses, so ambivalence and cost under pressure stay relatively soft. Her decisive change (from “thief of light” to wielder of it) is thematically earned but comes quickly, with limited dramatized struggle in the moment. Relationships are largely absent, so pressure never has a relational crucible to sharpen her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is vivid and specific—his theatricality, craft, and isolation are clear, and his actions align with his desire to build “safe zones for inquiry.” The shift from nomadic solitude to rooted host is legible and embodied via glassblowing. However, the internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized; he meets little real resistance in himself when choosing to stay. The result is a strong, textured character whose decisive change feels a touch too easy for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s fear-driven precision and “firmly adaptive” nature feel specific and consistent, and her final choice to weaponize both fear and stunt skills is motivated by what we’ve seen. The revelation of her stolen identity plausibly radicalizes her. Internal conflict (terror vs. hyper-competent control) is present but more told than embodied at peak beats. Harlan, however, remains thinly sketched as a character, functioning mostly as an expositional betrayer.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    The oracle has a clear, particular motivation and a distinctive way of acting on it, and his interaction with Elara is consistent with his “mild obsession.” Elara, however, is thinner: beyond desperation and awe we see little contradictory impulse or deeper value hierarchy under pressure. Their relationship never quite becomes a crucible—she asks, he teaches—so no real change in their dynamic or in her stance is dramatized. The final “pact” reads more declared than earned through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The janitor’s core motivation—to understand the origin of thoughts—is clear and consistently drives his actions, especially his decision to play the violin despite overload warnings. His “remarkably composed” nature and janitorial protocols provide a grounded counterpoint to the mystical material. However, internal contradiction and emotional texture remain relatively thin and conceptual rather than embodied. The closing endurance choice (resume sweeping with new understanding) is earned but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s and Mira’s core motives are clear and consistent, and his preparatory actions (collecting the lens, drawing the tickets) track well to those motives. However, Mira’s internal life is mostly summarized (betrayal, fear) rather than embodied, and her shift from deep mistrust to thawed openness happens very quickly once the doodles appear. Contradictory impulses under pressure (wanting to flee vs wanting to stay, wanting connection vs fearing it) are implied but not dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The ending change reads emotionally plausible but somewhat tidy and low-cost for the depth of damage implied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated, with a coherent worldview (“wisely pragmatic” gardener scornful of omens) and consistent choices that drive the story. However, his interiority is sketched more through ethos and ritual than through embodied, moment-to-moment emotional conflict, so we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. The auditors function mostly as flat institutional pressure rather than individuals with their own complex motives. The closing stance—Elias vindicated and continuing his work—feels earned but not deeply costly on the personal level.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her role as an “obliging sky mechanic” gives her a distinct function in the station. However, her inner life is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with little on-page contradiction or struggle when she finally activates the nexus. The relationship with Lirren is gestural—he offers skepticism but exerts minimal real pressure on her choice. The final “vindication” lands more as fulfillment of a thesis than as a hard-won, emotionally complicated shift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation (decode Elara’s message, honor her legacy) is clear and drives his choices, and his embodied reactions to the program and apparition are specific enough to feel personal. However, he moves through danger with almost no hesitation or contradictory impulse—there’s little sense of fear, guilt, or real moral friction about flooding and damaging the opera house. The relationship with Elara, while poignant, is more mythic than textured; she functions mainly as a benevolent guide. The end-state “ignited” feels earned in plot terms but somewhat under-explored emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is specific, embodied, and morally compromised in an interesting way: her “fault-tolerant” approach to prophecy and her guilt over the cartographer’s fate create a credible internal knot. Her motivation—to weigh the swallowed truth and her responsibility—is clear and drives each micro-choice (rising from bed, turning to the illustration, deciding to smudge it). The internal conflict between resilient, bend-don’t-break oracular practice and the cost of half-spoken truths is well realized. The only limit is that the conflict never faces a live, on-page other person, so some stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized in real-time interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Jax’s guilt, recklessness, and skepticism form a coherent, specific psychology, and his final act of turning the wheel feels earned by the layered revelation of his past. The internal contradiction—skeptical explorer drawn to quasi-spiritual artifacts, driven by unadmitted guilt—is credible. The realization that he was the anonymous confessor and his shift from denial to acceptance are well-motivated. Emotional experience is mostly embodied, though a few abstractions (“weight of a swallowed truth”) lean conceptual rather than deeply felt in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The chronicle keeper’s core motivation—to witness change without judgment and seek regenerative silence—is clear and consistent, and his choice to leave the library and burrow to the refuge tracks logically. However, he experiences almost no on-page internal contradiction or doubt; the move to abandon his long-held post costs him little in felt emotion. His “loose grip on reality” is more atmospheric than psychically dramatized, which flattens potential conflict. The final endurance in silence reads as earned stasis, but with minimal visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation (to nurture wonder as a way through grief) is clear, consistent, and embodied in specific choices: choosing Sage Ridge, timing the session with the eclipse, offering the locket. Lila is more schematic—“eyes dull as polished stones,” “silenced by her mother’s recent passing”—but her turn at the end still feels earned through the music and shared object. There’s little genuine internal contradiction in either of them under pressure; Elias never wavers, and Lila’s resistance is mostly static until it lifts. The emotional responses are believable and concrete, but shaded in broad, idealized strokes rather than sharply individualized complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thorne’s core drive—to collect the walls’ stories—is clear, consistent, and nicely embodied in habits like pressing his ear to concrete and sifting ash with trembling fingers. His oddness feels particular rather than generic, and his perceptive nature informs how he interacts with the space. However, internal contradiction is minimal: he’s never truly torn between competing impulses, so his final “fulfillment” reads more as confirmation than earned change. The emotional register stays largely at the same reflective pitch, limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has clear, specific motivation and a nicely odd occupation, but his interiority leans on summary (“his motivation crystallized”) rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from passive fortune-writer to active “shadow puppeteer” is conceptually strong yet emotionally underworked; he never truly wavers or fears retaliation. We’re told his fortunes have been accidentally prophetic, but we don’t see concrete past mistakes or costs shaping his present anxiety. The result is a coherent but somewhat frictionless character change.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to expose the shadow’s assumptions and stabilize the anchor—is clear and consistently expressed through his tactics. His interiority is more emblematic than human, with little contradiction or emotional messiness beyond determined focus. His choices (using the palette, building loops of silence, escalating rhetorical devices) track cleanly with that single motive. The ending offers endurance and completion rather than a charged renunciation, so the “cost” to him remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core longing and motivation are clear, specific, and consistently expressed, and small embodied details (bare feet on the floor, clutching the shell) ground her. However, she operates mostly as a single-note yearning consciousness; we see little genuine internal contradiction or fraying under stress beyond “exhaustion looms.” Her final transformation from “chronologically homesick” to sated feels emotionally plausible but comes a bit too smoothly, without a hard choice that costs her anything but fatigue. The boy’s brief appearance is evocative but doesn’t really function as a crucible for relationship under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—Elias wants to “conquer the labyrinth of self”—and his history with the viaduct and fall roots his drive. However, interiority stays abstract and emblematic rather than embodied; we’re told his soul is fractured but rarely feel specific, conflicting impulses in the present moment. The alternate lives (tyrant, hollow existence, solitude) are sketched quickly and conceptually, so their emotional cost on him is muted. The final integration with the shadow-self feels earned in outline but not deeply struggled-through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to pierce her emotional numbness—is clear and consistently expressed, and her choices (repairing the needle, orchestrating the rite) grow organically from that drive. Interiority is present but a bit label-y (“emotional numbness,” “the joy of music…now eluded her”) rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses at peak beats. Her change by the ending (numbness “fled”) is earned, though the cost is framed more as catharsis than a complicated trade-off. Thorne is lightly sketched but credible as a secondary character whose grief is reactivated rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s characterization as meticulous, calm, and integrity-driven is clear and consistent, and her occupational lens (storm recorder) nicely colors her perceptions and choices. However, she experiences little real internal contradiction under pressure—her pulse “steadies” and she moves almost too smoothly from data to conclusion, so the decision to work alone feels principled but low-cost. The follower’s threat and the possibility she’s being baited don’t register as a genuine emotional struggle. The ending reads more like a reaffirmation of her existing stance than a tested, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, professional competence, and aromatic caution cohere into a specific, legible personality whose choices (entering, uncorking, then fully inhaling) track his motives. The internal shift from guarded avoidance to deliberate exposure to pain is credible and earned. A few abstractions (“core concept laid bare,” “to pierce the veil of memory's tyranny”) flatten what is otherwise embodied emotion. Relationship to the late wife is vivid in memory but could use one more sharply particular detail to move from strong to indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to grasp the “texture of time”—is clear and consistently dramatized through his history as a prison poet and drifter, and the rope functions as an effective psychological anchor. Interiority is specific and mostly embodied (“callused fingers,” “quiet fire kindling”), with a credible internal tension between freedom and immersion/entanglement. The final decision to “integrate” rather than sever tracks with the established ethically playful contrarian streak, so his arc feels earned. Emotional contradiction could be sharpened (more terror or real reluctance at the potential loss of freedom) to deepen the cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lir’s motivation—seeking “beauty in the unfinished” and using sound fragments to push back the hush—is clear and consistent across the piece, and his final choice to release his own family fragment is thematically apt. However, his interiority is mostly asserted rather than conflicted; we’re told his belief system more than we feel him wrestling with it in the moment. The survivors remain largely faceless, functioning as a choral mass rather than individuated pressure. The emotional cost of unbinding his own memory is implied but could be embodied more concretely on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is sharply etched—a meticulous, affectively distant artisan whose faint pang at the end hints at buried conflict—but Mira functions more as a vessel than as a fully realized counterforce. His “professionally thorough” detachment motivates his every move, yet we rarely see genuine wavering or impulsive contradiction under pressure. The relationship dynamic—caregiver and consenting client—stays interesting but never quite combusts into a crucible that forces a costly choice. The ending endurance (he subsumes his pang into the work) is credible but thematically tidy rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias and Mira are clearly motivated—his debt to an anonymous benefactor and her philosophy of unseen compassion are well articulated and consistent. However, both are idealized; there’s little real flaw, contradiction, or messy emotion under pressure, so their choices feel low-risk. Interiority is more told than embodied, with almost no visceral response when the locket appears or the benefactor is revealed. The final change (from strangers to close, weekly confidants) is believable but too frictionless to feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s longing for community and her craft-based identity are clear and consistent, and her choice to sculpt at the arbor is a motivated culmination. However, her interior life leans on abstractions (“luminescent ache,” “boldly sympathetic”) more than concrete, character-particular contradiction. The group’s members are sketched with a few strong cues but face little real interpersonal friction. Emotional change (from isolation to belonging) is persuasive but comes with minimal visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, heirloom, and artistic drive give her a clear, specific motivation, and her choices (launching into the canals, using the pendant, reading the cadences) all align with that goal. However, she faces little genuine internal conflict; there’s scant sense of fear, doubt, or competing values under pressure. Her competence often feels untroubled, so the final “cost” of waking the giant reads more conceptual than emotionally earned. The characterization is strong for the length but not yet at a deeply conflicted, high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thorne’s motivation is clear and specific—he wants to resolve Elowyn’s ambiguous loss by “understand[ing] the mathematics of emotion”—and his actions map cleanly to that drive. His grief and hope are embodied more in ritualized action than in richly contradictory interiority, so we see more single-minded steadiness than simultaneous impulses in friction. The final shift toward hope is earned by the visions and the orchard’s response, but it lands as a relatively gentle turn rather than a hard-won, costly reorientation. Overall, he feels particular and coherent, but not yet as psychologically layered as a top-tier literary piece would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in his history with his wife’s stories, and his caregiving behavior is consistently dramatized (caches, careful interventions). The embodied link between the tape fragment and his grief is strong, giving him emotional particularity beyond a generic “kind hermit.” However, his internal conflict about leaving the shadows is underplayed—he moves fairly smoothly from vow to action with little on-page friction—so the final choice costs him less than it could. The woman is more symbolic than individuated, limiting relational complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand plants from within—is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the reluctance/obsession conflict is well-tracked through the tea and trellis scenes. However, his interiority leans abstract and rhetorical (“circuitously sincere,” “scaffold for deeper truths”) rather than grounded in concrete, character-specific memories or sensory fears, which blunts the cost of losing his humanity. The mention of his wife and legacy is evocative but underdeveloped and not dramatized in the moment of no return. The final acceptance as plant-man feels earned, but it could cut deeper if more of his particular human life were on the line in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: the insomniac painter whose mix of cynicism and earnestness drives his choices (following the rain, relinquishing/accepting the brooch, recommitting to painting). His emotional life is embodied in the environment rather than spelled out in therapy-speak, and his final stance—accepting purpose rather than pure survival—feels earned. Mira is thinner but still distinct, with her ancestral connection adding credible counter-pressure and shared need. Internal contradiction (mocking his own desperation yet pursuing meaning) is present, though it could be dramatized more through in-the-moment micro-conflict rather than explained in narration.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivations are clear (Thorne’s need to heal his fields, Elara’s role as reluctant conduit), and the final choice for Elara to accept inhabitation is basically earned by the setup of her gift and blind spot. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied; we rarely feel Thorne’s farmer-specific worldview or Elara’s internal contradictions in concrete terms. Her reversal from resisting to accepting happens quickly and relies more on stated insight (“she glimpsed truth”) than dramatized struggle. The relationship between them remains functional rather than a crucible; his presence doesn’t really pressure her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation (archiving absences into meaning) and a distinctive professional lens, and his decision to use the valve on the pier is well-motivated. However, he lacks real internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure; he never seems torn about whether to reveal hard truths versus comforts. Emotional texture leans more summarized than embodied in peak beats. The ending offers resolve without much visible personal cost or tension for him.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and professional obsession are clear and consistent, and his “analytically artistic” perception colors his actions well. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: doubt is mentioned but never really contends with his drive in a way that shapes a hard choice. The transition from obsessive seeker to “archivist of the revealed” feels largely frictionless, with little visible cost or sacrifice. More dramatized hesitation or a price for his truth-seeking would deepen his characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s blend of skepticism and caretaking is specific and consistent, and her shift from “sympathetic skeptic” to someone who embraces the tile’s power feels earned. Her micro-choices—taking the tile seriously despite disbelief, aligning it with charts, deciding to transcribe and share—track cleanly with that psychology. Emotional states, however, are sometimes labeled or summarized (“skepticism cracked,” “courageously kind”) rather than fully embodied in scene. The fisherman is thin but functional as a relational pressure, mainly a catalyst rather than a fully realized foil.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elowen’s core motive—boredom and hunger to know “what happens after goodbye”—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with it. However, he experiences little real internal contradiction on the page; once the amulet awakens him, he almost immediately commits to accelerating the mutiny. Emotional texture leans on elevated abstractions (“electric hunger”) rather than embodied, specific feeling. The final transformation feels conceptually earned but emotionally under-dramatized, with minimal sense of what he’s truly sacrificing beyond generalized ennui.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s core drive (an honest child seeking the “mathematics of a fair trade”) is clear and consistently tied to his actions, and the inheritance from Victor gives him specificity. The ink-induced loosening of his scruples is a credible pivot, though his internal conflict between honesty and necessary deceit is more asserted than deeply dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Embodied emotion is present but somewhat muted compared to the conceptual framing. The change at the end—choosing escape by con-like calculation—feels earned but not richly conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thorne’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined—his “earnestly studious” restraint and obsession with textures drive every action, especially his shift from safe, distant eras to confronting the town’s own night. Emotional interiority, however, stays mostly conceptual and stylized; we rarely feel his fear, grief, or guilt in embodied terms when the hum reveals the town’s final night. The change at the end (moving from hoarding invented histories to releasing truth) is credible and earned. The lack of on-page relational pressure (all townspeople are off-stage) keeps his arc strong but somewhat hermetic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wanderer’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and the death-certificate error is an excellent, specific anchor for their psychology. However, interiority leans conceptual (“texture of memories,” “erased histories”) over embodied sensation, so we don’t fully feel their fear, anger, or desire in the body. Internal contradiction—conflict between wanting anonymity and wanting recognition—remains more implied than dramatized. The final reclaiming of identity is earned but could land harder with more concrete emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to debunk the myth and decode the riddle—and his blend of “gloomy cheerfulness” and weariness reads specific rather than generic. The seashell, cello, and past mentors all refract his skepticism vs. hunger for meaning, giving him a credible internal contradiction. His final shift from “no ghost will grant it” to accepting myths as “self-made compasses” feels earned by the hum-induced conversations. The main limitation is that his emotional cost remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete sacrifice or relational consequence that would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core traits (orderly, intuitive, torn between carnival roots and mainland schooling) are clear and drive her decisions, especially the graffiti strategy and raft reorganization. However, her internal conflict is mostly told in abstract terms (“dual allegiance tore at her,” “hopeful desperation”) rather than embodied in specific, contradictory reactions in key moments. The relationship with Kai is functional but underdeveloped; he serves more as a plot courier than a crucible for her values. The final reconciliation of her dual allegiance reads thematically apt but a bit too smooth, with little felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s core drive (purposeful curiosity + desire to preserve the “last of something precious”) is clear and consistently motivates his transgression of protocol and summit climb. His profession and competence are convincingly embedded in his tactics (sampler probe, camera setup, chemical signaling). However, internal contradiction is underplayed: he rarely seems torn between survival and documentation, so his choice to linger for the perfect shot carries less visible emotional cost than it could. The final shift—melancholy lifting as he descends—reads more as a gentle modulation than a fully earned renunciation or deep internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and his methods and values clearly drive his actions, especially his tactile reading of vibrations and insistence on “honoring the machine’s whispered story.” His competence is richly drawn, but internal conflict is minimal; he never truly doubts himself or faces a charged trade-off beyond working quickly. Emotional texture is present but more implied than dramatized, with little sense of contradictory impulses in the moment. The final “decoded truth” about guiding others feels consistent but thematically tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Harlan’s motivations (obsession with headwaters, disdain for “downstream lies”) are clear and consistent, and his dry wit colors perception in a specific, characterful way. His mix of excitement and unease at the lake’s “worrying tranquility” gives a modest internal contradiction, though his inner conflict could cut deeper. Micro-choices like trusting the falcon, laboring over the runes, and ultimately leaving the outpost emerge naturally from his traits. The final choice—to venture into the unknown—feels earned but its emotional cost is more implied than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—restore balance via his craft—and his actions align with that goal throughout. However, his interiority remains thin and mostly symbolic; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, so he reads more as a mystical function than a fully human agent. “Infinitely patient” is told, not really dramatized under pressure. The ending change in him (“infinitely patient no more needed”) is asserted rather than earned through visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirael’s motivation (ancestral duty vs survival) is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between panic and resolve runs through the piece. The memory sequences tied to the vial add some specificity to her interiority. However, her psyche under extreme stress remains relatively generalized and idealized—she adapts almost too smoothly once the perfume acts, with limited messy contradiction. The final shift to “bearer of eternity’s quiet” feels earned but could land harder with a sharper sense of what she’s sacrificing in human, not just mythic, terms.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivations (redeeming his father, enforcing “hush”) are clear and consistently drive his actions, including the murders and descent into the labyrinth. However, internal contradiction is under-explored: there’s little felt tension between his desire for justice, his capacity for murder, and any residual guilt or doubt. The relationship with his father’s shade is thematically potent but emotionally muted, resolved almost too smoothly once the “truth” is recounted. The final stance—achieved hush at the price of multiple lives—reads more as concept than as a fully embodied, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s regret, solitude, and gradual surrender to the ghost’s “loving venom” are clear and consistent, and the bridal backstory gives his obsession emotional weight. However, his interiority is summarized more than dramatized—his conflict between self-preservation and longing is implied rather than concretely embodied in specific, pressured choices. The ghost bride has motive (repaying a debt) but little on-page complexity beyond that function. The final transformation into her “eternal groom” lands, but could feel deeper if his ambivalence and fear had been more textured on the way.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive—transforming ruin into a new kind of reverence—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices (defying the taboo, entering the labyrinth, sewing paths). Her interiority is more implied by imagery than dramatized with contradictory impulses, so we rarely feel genuine fear or doubt alongside her hope. Emotions skew abstract and lyrical (“hauntingly optimistic,” “fragile bloom”) rather than embodied in specific physical reactions. The final stance is earned conceptually but would gain power from more visible inner conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—returnee seeking to restore a shattered ancestral faith—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices to excavate, reconstruct, and remain. We get textured interiority via her exile backstory and her reactions to pilgrims’ artifacts, though those reactions lean more reflective than conflicted. The repeated labels (“warmly curious,” “cautious enchantment”) substitute somewhat for more embodied, contradictory emotional beats under pressure. Her final stance—faith rekindled, committed to guiding others—is earned but arrives with relatively little visible internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s profession, habits, and backstory create a clear, specific person, and her care with the chalk and margins feels grounded in a believable temperament. Motivation—protecting the whistleblower via analog craft and “meaning in the margins”—is consistent throughout. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or moral friction under pressure; she never really wavers or reveals competing impulses. The final choice to mail the letter is unsurprising rather than a charged renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is vivid and specific: an apparently doddering embroiderer whose inner acuity and ritualized work are clear and consistent. Her core motive (listening for "unheard stories") is dramatized through how she reads the stars and manipulates her appearance. Internal contradiction (foolish performance vs sharp interior) is strong, but there's little on-page emotional cost or doubt as she acts; she moves from insight to solution with relative ease. The endurance at the end feels earned but emotionally under-intensified for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she’s driven by regret over her past silence—and her actions (pressing on, evoking, weeping but continuing) align with that. However, her interiority leans more toward reiterated summary of motive than textured, contradictory impulses in-scene; we’re told she chose pride, but we don’t see that flaw complicate her present choices much. Thorne, appearing only at the end, is more emblem than character, with minimal distinct psychology beyond “I waited.” The final embrace reads emotionally plausible but slightly tidy, with limited sense of lasting cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and backstory are clear and specific—the loss of her brother, her work as a translator, and her drive to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” all cohere. Her internal state is well embodied in small gestures (trembling fingers, tracing the cast), but genuine contradiction under pressure is muted; she rarely faces a live dilemma. Kael feels more like an emblem than a fully present character, though his coded notes give him some individuality. The closing vow and tears are earned, but the emotional turn costs her little beyond a controlled opening of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to recover lost joy) is clear and consistent, and her interiority—especially the blend of ache and wry amusement—is specific rather than generic. However, she faces little genuine resistance or dilemma; her path from curiosity to fulfillment is smooth, with no sharp internal contradiction tested in action. The emotional development is more a deepening of one mood than a struggle between competing impulses. The final “change” is credible but low-cost, so the arc feels graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motives (restore the mural, awaken Lena’s curiosity) are clear and consistent, and Lena’s skepticism is economically sketched then reconfigured through the “nested awakenings” device. The inner cascade for Lena gives her more depth than a stock skeptic, especially the childhood firefly memory. However, her conversion is largely imposed by Elias’s magic rather than wrestled with, softening a sense of active internal conflict. The relationship dynamic shifts credibly from opposition to nascent partnership, but with minimal felt cost or resistance on Lena’s side.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is vivid as an archetype (“charming rogue scholar” guarding a “spark of defiance”), and his actions track cleanly with that frame, especially infiltrating Voss and choosing to scatter the seeds under siege. However, interior conflict is almost absent; we’re told his motivation more than we feel it under pressure. The relationship with Voss has intriguing status dynamics but never quite becomes a crucible that forces a hard trade-off. As a result, the final stance feels more declarative than earned through layered, contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s motivation (“to photosynthesize pain into beauty” and finally sleep) is clear, consistent, and rooted in a specific sensibility, and the centuries-long insomnia gives his desire real weight. His choices—lifting the postcard, deciding to center it in a rite, ensconcing it—track cleanly with that drive. Internal contradiction (attachment to his vigil vs. desire for rest) is implied but under-dramatized; he moves toward armistice with little on-page resistance. The final renunciation of wakeful guarding carries cost conceptually but could benefit from sharper, embodied ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—regret over losing Lirien's name and a drive to preserve others—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her role as caretaker. Interiority is embodied through recurring foxglove imagery and her tactile care for the orchids, giving her a distinct sensibility rather than a stock grief-arc. However, internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than dramatized—her remorse and purpose align almost too neatly, with little moment-to-moment ambivalence under pressure. The final shift (partial easing of regret through her success) feels earned but emotionally “clean,” limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore Thorne’s trust before they part—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her “carefully reckless” nature is both labeled and partially dramatized in how she works with the ink. Thorne’s skepticism and eventual softening are economically but credibly sketched through his questions and final touch on her shoulder. The inner conflict between her hunger for dangerous knowledge and fear of losing him is present but could be pushed into sharper contradiction under peak pressure. Emotional states occasionally tilt toward abstract labeling (“cautious exuberance”) instead of fully embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s core motivation (harmonizing safety with sacred preservation) is clear and consistently drives his actions, and the discovery of his great-grandfather’s letter deepens that conflict credibly. His emotional response—trembling, memory floods, revised vision of the floodgates—feels grounded in his history and craft. However, his struggle is somewhat smoothed over; the transition from conflicted to harmonized comes with limited on-page hesitation or error, so the cost of his change feels a bit under-explored. The clans and elders function more as a chorus than as individuated pressures on his psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is richly realized: his grief, obsession with preservation, and self-protective fraud all feel psychologically coherent, and his choices (forging journals, confessing, opening to Lila) emerge credibly from those traits. The relationship with Lila functions well as a crucible, forcing him to choose between the safety of his inventions and real intimacy. Internal contradiction—needing deception to feel safe while craving authentic connection—plays convincingly through the middle and climax. Lila herself is somewhat idealized and under-internalized, which slightly softens the tension around her discovery and forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elowen’s motivation—understanding sacred thresholds and finding her father—is clear and consistent, and her “intuiting” process gives her a distinct inner method. However, interior conflict is thin: she hesitates briefly at the warning (“Close the distance, lose the light”) but we don’t feel a sustained struggle between competing impulses. Emotions skew conceptual rather than embodied; we get lovely metaphors but little felt, physical stress. The final change (crossing and understanding) is earned conceptually but doesn’t register with much emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and sensibility are clear and particular, and Theo’s shift from guarded exile to tentative connection tracks, but their inner contradictions under pressure are underdeveloped. Her longing for belonging is mostly stated and beautifully decorated rather than dramatized in conflicting impulses on the page. The hand-holding and epiphany feel a bit too frictionless given the years of isolation implied. Still, their relationship does change in a believable way by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and particular—the “cheerful gloom,” sea-foam body, and obsession with vanished paths give her a distinct psychology. Her motivation (“before memory fades”) is clear, and her internal tension between regret and acceptance plays credibly in the final realization. However, her emotional shift from haunted to peaceful is a bit swift and neatly articulated, with limited dramatized resistance. A touch more friction or self-deception at the moment of insight would strengthen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jasper’s analytical, almost clinical drive to “orchestrate serendipity” is clear and consistent, and his choice to fling away his carved set nicely externalizes that motive. However, Elara’s interiority is largely inferred by Jasper and then asserted by the narrator (“trapped in a dead-end clerk’s life”), which feels convenient rather than dramatized. There’s little genuine internal conflict for Jasper—he never doubts, adapts, or pays a visible price beyond sacrificing props. The closing endurance of his mission reads credible but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive—to preserve the purity of her art through exile yet ultimately to inscribe it on Kai—is clear and consistent, and her panic/resolve while anchored shows some layered interiority. The core contradiction between elective isolation and longing for mortal connection is strong but could be dramatized more through on-page micro-choices rather than stated history. Kai, as an on-page presence, is more a receptive figure than an active crucible, so relational pressure at the end stays relatively soft. Her final choice to remain “anchored now by choice” is motivated and legible, but the emotional price could be shaded with more ambivalence or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation, reflective nature, and core desire (“to illuminate value in the mundane”) are clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially his decision to descend to the atrium and read the pond for guidance. His interiority is particular—he reads omens in fog and ripples rather than via generic rumination. However, internal conflict is soft: his doubts are mentioned but never sharply dramatized as competing impulses under pressure. The final resolve feels earned but relatively low-cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is vivid and particular—his burns, profession, and history with fire cohere into a clear, motivated center, and his choice to open the box and share his story undercuts his desire for solitude in a credible way. Internal conflict (vigilant hardness vs. tenderness toward the lost) is present but often told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. Lena is serviceable but thinner, functioning mainly as a mirror and recipient of wisdom. The final shift—her vow and his quiet pride—feels earned, if a bit neat and idealized for her age and trauma level.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to re-engineer hope—is clear and consistently expressed, and her methods align with that identity as a “logical dreamer.” However, she rarely experiences on-page contradiction or emotional friction; there’s no palpable doubt or cost as she succeeds. Interiority is mostly conceptual rather than embodied, which keeps her a bit abstract. The final stance feels earned in idea but not deeply tested in character.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn through vocation and sensory focus; his “corridor echo cartographer” lens feels particular and embodied. His conflict between dismissing the family “madness” and being dragged back by the echoes gives him a credible internal arc. The realization of ancestral guilt leads to a believable shift from shame to duty at the end. I’d like a bit more moment-to-moment contradiction under peak pressure—he adapts to the revelation very smoothly for someone whose entire moral ground just crumbled.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and particular (altering mirrors to show possibility, driven by a beloved’s despair), and her ritualized dependence on a borrowed heartbeat gives her a distinctive condition. However, she remains almost entirely serene and competent; there’s little on-page contradiction or struggle about stealing from children, so her interiority never sharpens into real conflict. The “perceptively calm” stance is reiterated rather than tested under pressure. The ending registers endurance more than change, with limited felt cost to her beyond ongoing dependency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (ending the war she helped ignite) is clear and coherent, and her final blood sacrifice is well-earned by prior guilt and resolve. However, most of her conflict is told rather than dramatized—she rarely exhibits simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, aside from the brief spectral-boy moment at the end. The delegates are essentially types (warlord, envoy) with minimal individuation, serving as a collective pressure rather than live relationships. This keeps the piece from reaching deeper, messier character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched as an “amoral philanthropist” whose genuine tenderness toward the huia egg complicates his monstrous history, and his motives for the pilgrimage and release are clear and consistent. The story does good work binding his fortune, his guilt, and his sentimentality into one psychology (“Philanthropy was his mask, amorality his shield, but this egg stirred the boy…”). Internal contradiction is present in scene, not only in labels, and his secrecy about the act suggests an earned, if limited, shift. The main limitation is that his internal struggle at the moment of release feels largely decided rather than contested on the page, softening visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s core motivation—to defy the lullaby of conformity—is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it throughout. However, interiority is largely abstracted into symbolic language (“her body became poetic”) rather than grounded, character-specific thought or contradictory impulses under pressure. She rarely feels like a psychologically particular person; she functions more as an emblematic figure. The final transformation (“chaste courtesan no longer bound”) lands conceptually but without a strongly felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s artistic ego, ethical concern, and thrill at control are clearly drawn, and his history with the puppets feels specific, but his shift away from them comes a bit too smoothly. We don’t really feel the loss of his former persona or any deep resistance; serenity + realization lead to a near-frictionless pivot. The troupe’s conflict is summarized rather than dramatized, so relational stakes and his flaws under pressure stay abstract. Still, his motivation and inner life are consistent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring overlooked lepidopteran histories via an “esoteric realist” practice—is clear, particular, and consistently embodied in her ritual of structures and knots. However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; her choices (climb, build, then accept dissolution) feel spiritually charged but not deeply contested. The one renunciation—refusing to rebuild after the wind undoes her work—is resonant but not sharply pressured by competing desires. Overall, she reads vivid but somewhat frictionless, limiting the depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guilt, technical care, and preservation motive are clear and consistent, and her artisan mindset nicely shapes how she approaches the rope and card. However, her internal conflict is mostly pre-resolved; once in the sanctum, she rarely wavers or pays a visible on-page price beyond weeping. The forgiveness arc is summarized rather than dramatized in the present, softening the impact of her final renewal. Strong, but short of fully lived-through contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand why paths choose walkers and to resolve her own curse—is clear and consistently drives her choices (entering the bunker, submitting to the pod, accepting transcendence). The internal conflict between cooperating with or breaking the directive is present but under-dramatized; she never viscerally hesitates at a high-stakes beat. Emotion is often expressed abstractly (“motivation to uncover why”) rather than through embodied, character-specific reaction. The final change from “foresight hindsight only” to full perception is earned conceptually, but its emotional cost reads muted.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezar’s motivation is specific and consistent—frugal, empiricist, obsessed with a covenant—but he encounters almost no real internal conflict or competing impulse on the page. His frugality is nicely embodied in choices (reused stylus, single lamp), yet his acceptance of the rift and vow come too easily. We rarely see fear, doubt, or selfish desire complicating the decision. As a result the final commitment reads credible but not deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias and Thorne are cleanly sketched with distinct motives—scheming pacifism vs. entrenched resentment—and Thorne’s emotional arc from armored grudge-holder to someone who releases resentment is legible and earned by the cellular-memory sequence. Interiority is mostly implied rather than rendered in specific thoughts, but the embodied responses (trembling, convulsing, clawing at his chest) keep it grounded. The resolution is a bit tidy—Thorne’s shift feels rapid and nearly total for such a deep-rooted trait—but within this length, it still reads as credible. More visible contradiction (Thorne resisting even as he remembers grace) would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—recapturing the dream of his wife—and his actions (deploying mirrors, repurposing the sextant, committing to the ritual) align consistently with that drive. The “firmly grounded” vs. chasing an illusion tension is stated but not deeply dramatized on the page; we don’t see him seriously waver or risk abandoning the attempt. Interiority is mostly carried through concrete sensory focus rather than abstract labels, which works, but his emotional complexity under peak pressure could be richer. The final embrace brings a real change, though the cost to him (or moral ambiguity) is only lightly implied rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias and Lila are both clearly motivated—his persistence and fear of irrelevance, her skepticism and pride—and their relationship shift is credible within the compressed length. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than deeply embodied, but key objects (the ribbon, the bag, the heart-tree) reveal them under pressure. Lila’s turn from scoffing to softening lands, though it edges on quick and tidy emotionally. The relationship does change in a felt way by the end, with a visible cost in vulnerability and concession on both sides.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s core motivation—pursuing forbidden, nonlinear inheritance—is clear and consistent, and her bright unease has some embodied moments (“boots crunched iridescent soil,” “bewilderment creased her brow”). However, her internal conflict stays largely conceptual; we don’t feel a sharp value clash or a concrete cost to becoming “curator become exhibit.” The final shift into “weaver of loops” reads more as a stated upgrade than a difficult, earned choice with visible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and competence are clear, and her “carefully resourceful” trait surfaces in concrete choices (inventorying supplies, rationing ink, decoding plants). However, she faces little genuine dilemma, and internal conflict is almost absent, so her values are never tested in a way that forces a costly trade-off. The time traveler is sketched more as a function of the premise than as a textured counterpart. The final vow to undertake more missions feels thematically apt but emotionally under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core drive—to reach the garden and reclaim her twin and lost identities—is clear and consistent, and her actions (searching, weaving threads, stepping through the arch) track with that goal. However, her interiority leans abstract (“trapped freedom,” “unkindled solace”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or contradictory impulses. Her emotional cost at the end—choosing eternal maze over the wider world—is conceptually strong but under-dramatized on the level of felt hesitation or doubt. The twin’s characterization is vivid in imagery but thin in terms of on-page relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is clearly and consistently drawn—adaptable, warmly methodical, driven to make sense of anomalies—and her choices directly steer the story. However, she encounters little genuine resistance, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or emotional cost; her pulse “quickens,” but she remains serenely competent. The resulting arc is more about demonstration of capability than a pressured change in self-understanding or value hierarchy. The final state (she has clarified the fables and restored order) feels earned but not deeply costly or ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Mapkeeper’s motivation is clear, consistent, and concretely embodied in her methodical actions, with professional detail (reading ripple-marks and cracks) giving her interiority specificity. However, she encounters little genuine resistance—no visible fear, doubt, or conflicting impulse—which flattens emotional complexity. Her success comes without a palpable personal cost, so the endurance feels relatively untested. The “hammered repose” quality is striking but risks one-note stoicism rather than layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning and to guide wanderers—is clear and consistently drives her choices from scavenging to rekindling the beacon. The internal conflict between doubt and faith is present but mostly articulated in abstract terms (“Coincidence? Or proof that stars remembered?”) rather than embodied in harder on-page dilemmas. Her emotional life is vivid yet leans on repeated formulations (“thistle-blown hope”) instead of more variegated, character-specific responses. The final stance shift (from doubt to conviction) feels earned but relatively low-friction given the near-inevitability of success once the shard appears.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Archivist’s motive—guarding and interpreting collective memory to sculpt identity—is clear and consistent, and her late doubt about her own origins adds welcome complexity. However, her interiority skews abstract, with relatively little concrete, embodied contradiction beyond “preemptively nostalgic” ache. Micro-choices (to descend, to continue measuring, to accept a collective identity) are present but occur without sharp on-page resistance. The closing stance feels earned but at low emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, history as a fire spinner, and talismanic knot create a distinctive, coherent character with clear motivation to fight hopelessness through craft. His interiority is mostly implied through sensory focus and chants rather than explicit thought, but the tension between weariness and playful defiance is legible. However, he rarely faces a real dilemma or temptation to give up; his choices feel linear and largely unopposed. The final vow to “light every dusk” is emotionally plausible but not built on a visibly costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elaron’s motivation—to understand the “texture of time” and to help Mira—feels specific and consistently dramatized, and his methodical gentleness under pressure is clear in how he waits through the pause and chooses an indirect approach. Mira’s turmoil is embodied in small details (trembling hands, voice like shells cracking), but her inner conflict remains somewhat generalized and backstory-light, which limits how deep the relationship crucible can cut. The final shift—Mira reaching for the cicada and “I see it now”—is earned but a touch too smooth, with limited sense of lingering contradiction or cost. Still, the piece presents two distinct, non-generic personalities whose choices feel motivated and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to hoard silences as a counter to her father’s bunkers and her own claustrophobia—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her micro-choices (waiting for inversion, risking the gilded hush, deciding to return). Her internal conflict between panic and the desire to stay in the trellis is well-embodied (“Breathe wide, she thought, stretching the contracted fear into open sky”). The relationship with the father is thematically strong but remains abstracted, so the emotional cost of “going back” is more conceptual than felt in-scene. The noise-weaver functions more as an external jolt than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation is clear and distinctive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—and his professional competence with the gondola and vial feels grounded, but his inner life remains mostly told rather than embodied. Mira and the children function more as types than as fully realized individuals, and we see little contradictory impulse or genuine strain in Elias. His serenity never wavers in a way that forces a costly choice; the resolution feels more like a demonstration of a method than a pressured decision. This limits the depth of characterization despite the strong conceptual hook.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear (lore-driven, drawn to the throne as stewardship rather than conquest) and her choices track consistently, especially her decision to hide rather than fight the drones and to commune with the throne instead of seizing it. The “wisely adventurous” label is supported by her tactical, lore-based problem solving, but inner conflict is thin—she rarely feels genuinely torn or overwhelmed despite the stakes. Emotional life is mostly implied through awe and nostalgia, with little contradiction or mess. The final acceptance of stewardship reads earned but not costly, which limits the depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s motivation—maintaining a painful boundary to force her growth—is clear and consistent, and his final act with the ring is earned by what we’ve learned about him. However, he reads more as an archetype than an individuated person, with interiority expressed in abstract, thematic language rather than concrete, character-specific thought. His tenderness versus ruthlessness does register as genuine internal conflict, but it’s told more than dramatized in embodied reactions. A more idiosyncratic emotional palette would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias has a clear backstory and motive—survivor of a pyramid scheme repurposing his trauma into communal gain—and his actions align with that. However, his interiority stays mostly at the level of declared traits (“virtuously mischievous,” “his motivation burned pure”) rather than embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. He encounters no real on-page doubt or temptation, so the transformation from “survivor” to “volunteer eternal” feels thematically tidy more than earned. The lack of a concrete interpersonal crucible also flattens potential nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions (playing the record, opening the panel, burning the documents) logically follow from it. However, his inner life is largely one-note—grimly purposeful—with little on-page contradiction or struggle once the truth is found. The choice to burn everything feels preordained rather than wrestled with in scene, softening the sense of cost. Interiority is elegant but somewhat abstract, more mood than psychologically specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen’s core motive—“to capture the shape of possibility before it dissolved into regret”—is clear and consistently enacted through his choices to pledge allegiance and open the clasp, but his interior life remains thin beyond this single drive. The “withdrawn knight” trait is mostly asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific past shadows. His final state (silence becoming “legend’s voice”) offers a conceptual shift but not a strongly felt emotional cost on the page. A deeper, more embodied conflict between solitude, fear, and desire for control would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s grief and curatorial impulse are clear and specific, and her choice to pry open the box, interpret the letter, and revise the file all track cleanly with her motivations. The inner life is textured but relatively straightforward—there’s not much contradictory impulse beyond sorrow versus hope. Her shift from passive mourning to renewed, purpose-driven engagement reads earned, if gentle. The lack of any on-page relational crucible keeps the characterization from feeling fully multi-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s core drive and role as an underestimated, stubbornly principled rebel are clear and consistent, and his actions align with that motivation. However, his interiority leans on generalized language (“indifference was the true chain”) rather than character-specific contradictions or embodied emotion. We’re told he’s carefully resourceful more than we feel his fear, doubt, or competing impulses under pressure. The final stance (holding the line, vanishing into the night) is earned causally but lacks a sharp sense of personal cost or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation to silence the prophecy, rooted in his sister’s loss and childhood visits, is clear and consistent, and his tactic of using music and silence arises logically from that drive. However, his interiority stays relatively one-note—steady resolve and grief—with little on-page contradiction or faltering under pressure. The emotional cost is implied more than dramatized; “breath ragged” and cresting nostalgia feel slight compared to the declared “shattering cataclysm.” The final endurance/earned stasis works, but the character could bear more complex ambivalence or risk to reach elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lir’s motivation and temperament (“mossy delight,” devotion to folklore, meticulousness) are clear and consistent, and his profession nicely inflects his choices. What’s missing is genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure—he largely glides from success to success without hesitation or cost. The sylph is functional but thin, serving more as exposition vector than as a character applying pressure. The final stance (joyful acceptance of his role) is earned but too frictionless for this to feel fully character-driven at a literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation and contradiction (meticulous planner yearning to befriend uncertainty) are clear and drive his choices from opening the strange watch to stepping through the waterfall. His interiority is embedded in physical actions—quartz screwdriver, vine-spring rope—rather than abstract musing alone. The change at the end (new alliance with uncertainty) is earned but slightly tidy, with limited felt cost or lingering ambivalence on the page. Still, he reads as a specific, coherent individual rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motivation and vow to “redeem the name” are clear and consistently embodied in her choices with the coin and crucible. Her internal contradiction—devoted to balance yet choosing to push her craft to dangerous extremes—is well sketched, though rendered more in conceptual language than in messy, moment-to-moment emotional wobble. Thorne is more symbol than character, but that’s acceptable at this length given his late entrance. The final reunion is emotionally legible and causally earned, if slightly too clean to feel fully costly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and methods are clear and specific, and her modest fearlessness comes through in embodied choices (descending the jagged path, playing despite physical strain). However, she’s almost entirely competent and morally steady, with little in-scene contradiction or genuine error. Harlan is defined mainly by his guilt and functions well enough as an antagonist-force, but he remains thematically emblematic more than psychologically particular. The final ache in her chest gestures toward ongoing cost but doesn’t quite deepen her interior complexity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—protecting and then reclaiming the “mathematics of mercy” through her altered body—is clear and consistent, and her endurance under pressure reads specific rather than generic. The proprioceptive interiority gives her a distinctive embodiment of emotion. However, her inner life stays largely on a single axis (torment → revelation) with little contradictory impulse or moral messiness, and she never faces a genuinely difficult choice on the page so much as an ordeal she must weather. The final “rooted yet free” stance is earned but feels more conceptual than emotionally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear, consistent from childhood to present, and credibly tied to her work as a translator. However, interior conflict is minimal; she never seems truly torn or at risk of failing, and contradictory impulses don’t surface in-scene. Her emotions are more lyrically asserted than embodied under pressure, so peak beats feel relatively frictionless. The final fulfillment of her motivation lands, but without much visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theo’s vocation, ghost-sight, and compulsion to uncover what’s hidden above are clear and consistently dramatized through his choices. His calm, workmanlike response to the supernatural gives him a distinctive texture, and his competence feels earned in the puzzle-solving. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal contradiction or visible emotional cost beyond the “fractionally” lightened burden. The final act of pocketing the barrel as a talisman hints at a deeper flaw/need but isn’t fully worked through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s goal and obsession (“to compress eternity into a moment”) are clear and consistent, and his letterpress habits and frost-reading give him a distinct texture. However, he experiences almost no genuine internal conflict once the bottled whisper is found—his “fingers trembling” is the only hint of ambivalence before he proceeds. Choices are motivated but not deeply contested, so the final sacrifice costs the world more than it seems to cost him emotionally. This limits the sense of a hard-won, character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—salvaging his failed revolution via the Aetherian narrative—and his final choice to destroy the shard rather than wield it directly feels earned. His poet/revolutionary duality colors his perceptions and tactics. However, internal contradiction under immediate pressure is more implied than dramatized; once he commits to the gambit, he largely moves in a straight line without on-page wavering. Lira and Kane are functional foils rather than fully pressured relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation (reclaiming dawn and his daughter) is clear and specific, and his occupational focus is well integrated with his choices at the bench. However, he faces little visible internal contradiction or doubt—he’s competent, steady, and simply succeeds—so we don’t see a rich hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional states are mostly implied via external action and backstory rather than embodied in the moment. The final weeping beat works but feels like a direct payoff of declared stakes rather than a complex evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear and particular—petrichor collecting and the quest for where explanations fail give her a distinct angle. However, she encounters little genuine internal conflict or ambivalence even when facing a lagoon that killed others; her decisions tend to feel straightforwardly right and untroubled. Embodied emotion appears (“fingers trembled”) but often yields to abstract phrasing. The final change—embracing her role as key to this realm—reads earned but relatively low-cost and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament (“spirited,” “perpetually learning”), and core drive to turn disorientation into art-driven navigation are clear and consistent. Her decisions—to welcome the GPS failure, claim the slide, build the sculpture-lantern, and walk out—feel motivated, if emotionally idealized. What’s missing at a top level is sharper contradiction or flaw under pressure; she adapts almost too smoothly, with little visible fear or selfish impulse. The final shift (isolation → portal/alliance) lands but feels more conceptual than earned through messy internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her obsession with understanding night-blooming flowers drives every action from retreating to the pavilion to uncovering the cathedral window. Her interiority is sensorial and specific, though her inner life skews singular rather than conflicted; we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses in play. The link to her grandmother adds emotional depth, but remains more implied than dramatized. Her final realization is earned by prior beats, though the cost feels gentle rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation as a solemn archivist seeking suppressed truths is clear and consistent, and his fear of entrapment in the retrocognitive vision gives him a credible on-page pressure. However, his inner life never quite moves beyond a single, earnest note—there’s little contradictory impulse (duty vs self-preservation, awe vs revulsion) dramatized in the moment. The guardians function more as atmospheric forces than characters, so relationship pressure is minimal. His final resolve to “broadcast these truths” feels earned but not deeply reconfigured from his starting stance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s core motivation—rejecting illusory escape to rebuild civilization—is clear and consistent, and his choices align with it. However, he reads as an almost pure emblem of resolve, with little contradiction or emotional wobble under pressure, which flattens his complexity. The ghosts’ tempting visions offer an opening for genuine internal conflict that the story brushes past quickly. The final endurance feels earned but not hard-fought on a psychological level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, history, and present desire are clear and specific, and his interior lens on the world feels distinct. His core motivation (archiving emotions) is credibly rooted in the childhood memory, and the late reveal of his loneliness gives the ending some bite. However, his internal conflict—collector vs participant—only really crystallizes in the final lines, so contradictory impulses don’t fully play against each other on the page. A touch more dramatized hesitation or self-deception under pressure would deepen him into the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—both preserving the inheritance and personally experiencing “the texture of borrowed time.” Her emotional state is embodied in specific images (silver braids tugged, breath fogging) and her competence is consistent with decades as a seed saver. However, she faces little internal contradiction or doubt during the crucial ritual, so her choice feels more like an execution of a plan than a pressured moral or emotional trade-off. The lack of visible cost at the end keeps her arc from fully earning high-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (favoring listening over noise) is clear, consistent, and tied to professional detail, and his choice to route power to the bell aligns with that motivation. However, his internal life is relatively one-note: he’s curious and humble, but we see little contradiction, doubt, or real irrationality under pressure. The cost of his stance is gestured at (risking the villages by choosing the bell), yet not deeply felt on the page. The later “guardian”/teacher summary further smooths away any remaining edge to his flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s inner life is vivid and consistent: the “cosmic janitor” who longs for spiritual understanding is a distinctive, grounded figure. His vulnerability and ache for meaning motivate the ritual with the lantern and his final reframing of his role. However, his internal conflict is largely stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, and the epiphany comes a bit too smoothly. A touch more on-page struggle or resistant impulse at the climax would deepen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recluse’s motivation—accepting guardianship of the renewed covenant—is clear and consistent with his contemplative nature, and his choices (following the ghost, performing the ritual, accepting the pact) track logically. However, his interiority stays largely implied and serene; we get little true contradiction or struggle as he takes on a lifelong burden. The lack of friction or ambivalence in his emotional progression keeps the character from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to grasp the “texture of time” and reconnect with Lira through relics) is clear and consistent, and his shift from custodian to “weaver” of time is earned by the urn revelation. Interiority is sensuous and specific but mostly single-note—he rarely registers conflicting impulses beyond a generalized urgency about borrowed time. Emotional reaction to the urn and to Lira is strong yet somewhat idealized; there’s little messiness or resistance once the shard activates. The final stance feels more accepted than wrestled with, which slightly softens the impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to find beauty in the incomplete—is clear and consistently dramatized through his choices (retrieving, repairing, and relaunching the kite). However, he lacks real internal contradiction; when the kite snaps he feels “anticipation” rather than any mixed grief or frustration, which flattens potential complexity. Emotions are largely filtered through aestheticized perception rather than embodied conflict. The final stance feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s core motivation and temperament (“gently systematic,” “brazen calm”) are clear and consistently dramatized through his methodical work and refusal to panic about his prognosis. However, he reads almost entirely as saintly caretaker with little visible contradiction or moral friction, which flattens complexity. His choices (to return, to wire the grove despite his failing body) are motivated but not significantly conflicted. The endurance to death is earned, but the cost is more physical than psychologically nuanced.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to decode the “chemistry of homecoming”) is clear, consistent, and drives every on-page choice, from quitting her post to hacking drone feeds and activating the tower. Her “luminous skepticism” is embodied in how she resists cosmic grand narratives yet yields to awe at the climax. Internal contradiction (rebel academic vs. quasi-mystic pilgrim) is present but largely stated rather than dramatized under sharper pressure. Kai and Mira are serviceable but lightly sketched foils who don’t significantly complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thorne’s motivation—to redeem the battlefield through a garden—remains clear and consistent, and his occupation and past (storms, sieges) add texture. However, his emotional life is mostly declared rather than dramatized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. His “soul's reckoning” is asserted, but the on-page struggle is minimal, as everything works on the first attempt. The final lightness feels earned but relatively low-cost because his interior conflict never meaningfully complicates his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s longing and professional past are clearly motivated and consistent, and his decision to leave retirement to pursue Mira feels earned. The reunion reconfigures his role from corpse-finder to life-hunter in a credible way for the length. Internal contradiction—his pull toward decay versus his new mandate to “hunt life”—is present but more implied than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. Mira is intriguing but sketched more through role and symbolism than deeply embodied interior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core traits—blessed pariah, uncanny navigation sense, devotion to family custom—are clear and consistent and they credibly drive her decision to enter the rift. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped: fear, grief, and reluctance barely contest her curiosity, so the peak choice feels almost frictionless. Embodied emotion is intermittent and often replaced by conceptual language (“confusion transformed”) rather than lived sensations. The shift from abandoned outcast to confident explorer is stated more than dramatized, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elarion’s motivation (amending the Arbiter’s error and living his vow to embrace the unknown) is clear, consistent, and nicely embodied in his playful reverence toward the heist. Interiority is present though often declared in abstract labels (“sacredly playful,” “chivalrous thief”) rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure. His key choices—risking the swap, destroying the corrupted queen instead of retreating—track cleanly with his established values. The cost feels relatively light and externalized, so his internal change reads more as confirmation than evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thorne’s motivation—to free himself to become a “historian of small gestures”—is clear, consistent, and tightly tied to his past as a crisis actor/survivor. The ritual of walking words feels like a specific, character-driven tactic rather than generic magic. However, his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we’re told he’s “benevolently ruthless,” but we don’t feel much live hesitation or ambivalence about severing a part of himself. The arc from haunted survivor to “historian reborn” is compelling but a bit emotionally under-textured for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to recover the true shape of home despite the pain of memory—is clear, specific, and governs all her choices. The internal conflict between self-protection (burying her gift) and need (unlocking the stone) is well articulated, especially at the moment she first traces the glyph and lets the “mercury-silver” visions return. However, the struggle feels slightly smoothed over; there are few moments where her hesitation or resistance actively derails or complicates an action in scene. The final transformation (reframing home and accepting her talents) is earned but could carry more immediate, embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—guilt over cheating to feed his family and a hunger for self-forgiveness—is clear, specific, and consistently pressed by the tapestry encounter. The chess lens on his thinking (“paths as pawns and dead ends as blunders”) individualizes his interiority, and his micro-choices (entering the hall, committing to winnowing, accepting the mirror’s truth) track well. The final realization edges toward tidy (“To forgive oneself… was to winnow the self-pity from necessity”), but it’s earned by the earlier specific memories (student’s eyes, empty hearth). Some contradictory impulses (shame vs. desperate love) are present, though they could tangle on the page a bit more viscerally to feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent—her defiance, artistic temperament, and personal grudge (father’s exile) all clearly drive her choices. Interiority is sketched more through stylized narration than through specific, contradictory impulses in the moment, so she reads more as an emblem than a fully conflicted person. Her mischievous behavior with the youths shows character in action, and her “warpaint” at the end solidifies her stance. What’s missing at this level is a felt on-page cost or serious internal doubt as she escalates her rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist’s guilt, self-doubt, and stubborn drive to redeem past harms are clear and consistent, and his choice to keep working through each pockmark under lethal pressure feels motivated. However, internal conflict is often summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page; he moves fairly smoothly from “uncertain” to “certain” without many micro-choices that show real wobble. Embodied emotion appears (lungs burning, trembling hands) but could be more specific and less metaphor-driven to feel truly lived-in. The final certainty is earned enough for this length, but not yet at a “flawless” literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s nostalgia, solitude, and latent romanticism are specific and consistent, and his vow gives him a clear through-line of motive. The shift from “intimately aloof” to actively completing and relinquishing the shell reads earned and costs him his protective illusions. Emotional texture is mostly embodied through setting-perception rather than direct feeling labels, which works, though a few abstractions (“truth of nostalgia”) skim the surface instead of dramatizing contradiction. Internal conflict could sharpen further if his reluctance to face the past were more actively resistant in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s longing, regret, and determination are clear and particular, and the contrast between his past shouting and present whispering gives him a real, if tidy, emotional arc. His embodied experience (heat wave memories, trembling hands, breath syncing with waves) grounds the interiority. However, internal contradiction under pressure is lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized, and Mira’s interiority is absent, making the reconciliation feel somewhat frictionless. The final embrace lands emotionally but at relatively low cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is vivid and particular—the burns, grafts, reverse migration, and ancestral pull all cohere into a clear, lived-in motivation. His emotional life is mostly embodied rather than labeled, and his final, quieter wholeness (“his scars less jagged”) feels earned. What’s missing at a top-tier level is stronger on-page contradiction—he rarely seems torn, only resolute, so internal conflict under pressure stays relatively soft. The relationships with the phone voices are evocative but remain one-way and underexplored as crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to escape compelled honesty and build psychological safety—is clear, consistent, and credibly escalates to the extreme act of inserting the relic. His rational, data-driven temperament meaningfully shapes his tactics (sensors, pH probes, careful measuring, sterilizing) and contrasts with the mystical cure. Internal conflict (desire for connection vs. integrity of truth) is present but more often articulated in conceptual terms than embodied in specific sensations or irrational impulses. Lira and Thom function as relational pressure points, but remain thin sketches rather than fully realized foils.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply etched: an eccentric, observant loner whose habits (carving driftwood, muttering to gulls) and occupational competence ground his interiority. His motivation to decode the stranger’s gesture is clearly rooted in both professional habit (unraveling wrecks’ secrets) and a buried personal wound, and his final choice to wear the boutonnière and reframe his vigil feels earned. Internal conflict—between isolation as curse and isolation as vocation/identity—is present but could be dramatized with a few more in-the-moment contradictory impulses rather than mostly via reflection. The stranger is necessarily opaque yet still feels particular, which heightens the impact of Elias’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation—honoring his father’s promise and escaping loneliness through the Doorway—is clear, consistent, and drives his choices from shop to cavern. His profession and “empirically intuitive” bent individualize him, and the ants-following choice shows concrete, character-specific problem solving. However, his internal conflict is relatively underplayed; the reckoning at the Doorway reads as a swift, tidy insight rather than a struggle between live alternatives. The emotional cost of his past isolation is more told than embodied at the climax, which blunts the sense of hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elowen’s motivation—disenchantment with hollow rule and the need to end her dreams’ tyranny—is clear, consistent, and drives each major choice, especially the climb and her acceptance of the grotto’s power. Her interiority is vivid but slightly one-note; she rarely hesitates or shows simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure, so the embrace of peril feels almost too smooth. The relationship with Thorne registers mainly as loyal support and light resistance rather than a crucible that forces a sharp relational change. The final shift from hollow queen to vengeful, re-ignited ruler is earned, but the emotional cost of surrendering her “disenchanted heart” could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lirien’s motivation—to “capture the density of presence” and revalue her bond with Thorne—is clear and consistent, and her choices (revealing the shell, initiating the ritual, the whispered confession) arise credibly from that drive. However, interiority leans abstract and thematic rather than embodied; we rarely feel her fear, shame, or desire in concrete, contradictory impulses. Thorne is largely reactive, with minimal depth beyond admiration and latent affection. The final reconfiguration of their relationship is earned conceptually but could use more on-page emotional friction and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—“paid in whispers and wild honey” and “jealous of past selves” feel psychologically particular and consistent with her profession. The contradiction between jaded professionalism and feral yearning plays through the whole piece and motivates her tactic of induced jealousy. However, her arc resolves more as a reframing than as a hard choice with visible cost, and no relationship crucible or external pressure tests her values. The emotional palette also leans heavily on repeated abstractions (“nostalgia,” “jealousy”) rather than fresh embodied beats at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply etched: her lost smell, tactile/sound-based intuition, and gentle reverence for the clock’s history feel particular and embodied. Her motivation—to uncover the human stories lodged in mechanisms—reads clearly and drives her micro-choices at the bench. Internal contradiction is more muted (she has accepted her loss rather than wrestling with it on the page), so the change at the end is a quiet reaffirmation rather than a hard turn. The elderly woman is thin but serviceable as a relational pressure and emotional mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (avoid exile, transform scars into legacy) is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her bodily reactions (itching, crystallizing scars, breath control) give her interiority specificity. The contradiction between crippling doubt and stubborn ritual focus is present but could sharpen—her success, once the quill is invoked, feels relatively untroubled by renewed hesitation or mistake. Her final transformation into someone who claims her scars as story is earned by the preceding images, though the “lesson” edges close to being stated outright. Secondary relational pressure (the guild, the mentor, the villagers) is entirely off-page, limiting the crucible feel.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to make amends for a specific, career-destroying betrayal—is clear, concrete, and consistently drives her choices in the scene. Her profession and history (gossip-column exorcist who once sold Theo out) create a vivid, particular flaw rather than a generic guilt. The internal conflict could be sharper in the moment; she moves fairly directly from intent to apology with limited on-page hesitation or competing impulse. Theo’s presence is more textural, but his response and final line credibly complete the relational arc.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elowen’s motivation—to unravel illusions and unify the cosmos—is clear and consistently enacted, but he reads more as an archetypal function than a fully individuated person. Interiority is almost entirely conceptual; we seldom see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion beyond “weight” and “trembling fingers.” His final transformation feels thematically apt but relatively frictionless, with little sense of what he risks or might lose. The result is effective for mythic mode but thin for elite literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and mindset are sharply etched—“hydraulic clock shepherd” with callused hands and obsessive curiosity is memorable and specific. His motivation shifts convincingly from routine duty to a near-mystical need to understand what clocks truly measure. Internal contradiction (duty vs. doubt, fear vs. compulsion) is present but could be dramatized more directly under pressure rather than mostly implied. The final acceptance of his role as guardian of “razor edges” feels earned but slightly brisk, with limited sense of emotional cost beyond relief.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s professional focus and “spatially gifted” perception feel specific and consistent, and her shift from controlling intrusions to “letting go” is causally grounded in the encounter with Elias and the rat test. However, her inner life leans more toward articulated theme than conflicted, embodied emotion, so we rarely see contradictory impulses in real tension. Elias is evocative but lightly sketched as a catalyst rather than a fully pressured presence. The final realization feels earned but low-cost, more evolution of technique than a painful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and credible—her mix of grief, intellectual rigor, and ambivalence toward her father’s gambling is well rendered, especially in how she reads the scrawls as extensions of him. Her motivation to “widen perspectives responsibly” aligns with the final decision to publish, and the arc from resistance to reframing his legacy feels earned. Internal contradictions (admiration vs repulsion; rebellion vs responsibility) are present but occasionally told rather than dramatized. The emotional cost of embracing his manuscript could be embodied more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply realized—his ritual with the harmonica, the booth, and his deliberate cultivation of estrangement feels particular and psychologically coherent. Mira is sketched efficiently with enough detail (divorce, ghosted sister, urban loneliness) to carry emotional stakes in this length. His motivation to “teach endings how to begin” grounds his choices, but he shows little real internal friction at the climax, so his final severing feels more like execution of a doctrine than a pressured, ambiguous choice. The emotional embodiment could also go a notch deeper in a few key beats, especially around his own cost when he hangs up.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve small, intimate moments and renew a lost covenant—is specific and consistent, and her actions (petal selection, steeping ritual, using his rib-bone spoon) align with that drive. Interiority is vivid and embodied, though the emotional palette leans heavily on one note (“haunted euphoria”) rather than showing sharper internal contradiction or genuine risk of refusal. Her final endurance choice—letting him return to the locket and recommitting to her work—is credible but low-friction, with limited sense of foreclosed alternatives. The relationship with the spectral lover is affecting but one-sidedly reverent, leaving little room for messier or more idiosyncratic flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched—a burned-out, desperately jocular logistician whose loneliness motivates his elaborate scheme—and Mira gets just enough specificity to feel real in one line. His backstory (Siberia, carrier pigeons) is efficiently woven and explains his tactics. However, we get little in-the-moment interior contradiction or embodied feeling beyond “desperately jocular,” so his emotional shift at the end, while plausible, doesn’t land with maximal depth. The community is more thematic chorus than individuated pressure on him.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elar’s motivation—seeking the stillpoint to reckon with grief over his lover—is clear, particular, and sustained from the opening through the final image. His sensory world and gift (absorbing languages through skin) create a distinct interiority that feels embodied rather than abstract. Internal conflict appears in his doubts about worthiness and the rival’s warning, but those doubts do not significantly distort his behavior or force a hard trade-off. The final change (integrating his lover’s farewell and removing the ring) is earned and resonant, though the cost feels more gently cathartic than sharply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—atoning for the wrong seeds and “threshing meaning”—is clear and coherently threaded through her choices, especially in deciding to use the pen to revise history. The “confidently uncertain” trait gives her a credible inner texture, but we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses collide in-the-moment; she tends to move from insight to action without much friction. Emotional response is mostly conveyed via concept and imagery rather than deeply embodied feeling, which slightly flattens the cost of her revisions. The closing self-revision (“unbent herself from regret’s curve”) is thematically apt but feels more lyrical than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Finn’s faded-celebrity loneliness and tentative reawakening are clear and embodied in his behavior at the pier and during the performance, and Elara’s role as instigator is consistent. However, both characters lean archetypal—“celebrated composer now forgotten,” “mysterious guide”—with little contradictory impulse or moral friction under pressure. Finn’s shift from isolation to public action works but feels relatively tidy and low-cost. The relationship dynamic is effective but not deeply stressed or transformed beyond mentorship and rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive—love for Theo and devotion to his promise—is clear and consistent, and her emotional responses to each artistic clue feel specific rather than generic. The arson backstory gives her a morally fraught edge, but in the present scene she rarely faces a live dilemma; she mostly follows the trail. Internal contradiction (rage vs tenderness, guilt vs purpose) is implied more than dramatized through on-page choices. The final shift from arsonist to guardian is credible but happens with little resistance or cost beyond summarized emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (refusing “scripted docility,” reclaiming the entanglement and escaping) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her emotions are often embodied through pain, drumming, and sensory perception. However, her inner conflict is relatively one-note—she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses beyond grief-fueled determination—so the final liberation, while earned, is not deeply surprising. Kai functions more as a symbolic counterpart than a fully pressured character, with minimal distinct psychology on the page. The endurance/renunciation cost is present (risking pain, alarms, and annihilation of the garden) but not interrogated in morally or psychologically complex ways.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is vivid as a hyper-competent, quietly competitive worker whose trust in paper and low frequencies feels particular and consistent, and his tactical choices in the race grow credibly from that. Harlan is more archetypal—a boastful rival whose interiority never appears—so the relationship dynamic is crisp but somewhat simple. The hinted “deeper motive” for Elias (“burned with a deeper motive”) is never made concrete, which slightly undercuts the sense of full complexity. The final endurance of his subtlety-first ethos is earned, but the emotional cost—beyond Harlan’s humiliation—is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara and Umbra are clearly motivated archetypes—guardian and void—with Elara’s drive to teach and Umbra’s hunger and loneliness consistently embodied. However, interiority is almost entirely implicit; we infer feeling through metaphor and gaze rather than through any textured, character-specific contradiction. Umbra’s transformation, while thematically apt, feels emotionally frictionless, with little visible struggle or resistant impulse on the page. The change is credible for a fable, but thin for elite literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and coherent—using chess and telepathy to seed doubt in a conformist town—but he experiences almost no on-page fear, hesitation, or moral friction, which flattens his complexity. His gift and role as coach are nicely tied to his tactics, yet he reads as serenely competent rather than pressured or internally divided. The final state (returning to the boards, “coach eternal”) feels earned but relatively costless. A single moment where his resolve is in tension with personal risk or affection for specific students would deepen him considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara and Kai are clearly motivated and distinct, with their banter and work details grounding them in the world. The key choices—keeping the scrimshaw, confessing, cutting loose—are motivated and consistent. However, the scrimshaw’s compulsion flattens some interior contradiction, making the heart-revealing moment feel a bit externally triggered rather than fully struggled for. Their acceptance of merfolk identity happens rapidly, with little dramatized hesitation or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The performer’s core contradiction—unsure whether she acted from love or murderous relief—gives her real moral texture, and her need to “cultivate lightness” grows plausibly from that. Her coping strategy (theatrical narration + whittling) aligns with this psychology and produces concrete micro-choices. However, some interiority leans on abstract labels (“emotional void,” “morally ambiguous mercy”) rather than fully embodied experience at peak beats. A sharper, more bodily rendering of grief and numbness would push this toward elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and consistent—an aesthetically driven urge to dissolve sacred boundaries—but he faces little internal contradiction or doubt. Interiority leans abstract (“tremor of certainty”) rather than embodied, so we know what he wants more than how it costs him. His transformation into a cloud-shadow/quartz hybrid reads as an outcome of the world’s rules rather than a hard-won, conflicted change. Strong concept, thinner psychological texture keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivations (wake Mira, value imperfection, reluctance to trade his sight) are clear and consistently dramatized through his choices. His “innocently cunning” quality is shown rather than told in the way he manipulates the barter with the phoenix. Emotional embodiment is present but somewhat muted; we’re told his “heart quickening” more than we feel layered inner conflict over the cost of sight. The friendship with Mira is sketched efficiently but could bear one more concrete, pressured moment to deepen their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen’s core motivation—to rediscover the “texture of connection”—is clearly stated and carries through, and her profession and ritual duties are specific. However, she remains more archetype than individual; we don’t see concrete personal history or idiosyncratic contradictions that would make her fully lived-in. The internal “conflict” largely consists of serially stated assumptions that she questions, rather than embodied, competing impulses in the moment. The final realization is emotionally resonant but arrives more as concept than as a hard, character-specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s grief, craft background, and emerging purpose are clearly motivated and consistent, and her micro-choices (adapting tools, where to place figures) feel grounded in who she is. What’s missing at this level is sharper internal contradiction or live hesitation once she discovers the stencil—she moves from despair to functional ritualist with little dramatized struggle. Her emotional journey is more told through setting and motif than through conflicted interior beats. The final acceptance of purpose feels earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—mapping cultural patterns as a family duty—is clear and consistently dramatized through her ritualized work. Theo has a credible emotional state (estranged, hollow-eyed, burdened with a secret), but his inner life is mostly gestured at rather than explored. Interiority stays relatively surface-level and rarely shows true contradiction or cost; Elara scarcely wavers, even when the duty deepens. The relationship between aunt and nephew gains significance but never quite becomes a crucible that forces a hard emotional or ethical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and specific—an archivist driven to pierce history’s lies—and her struggle between scholarly love of pattern and the need to unmake pattern is well dramatized. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart pounding in anguished joy”; veil twisting into chaos) rather than abstract labels. Her final renunciation of her own nostalgia feels earned by the prior failed attempts and adaptations, with a clear cost to her selfhood. Slight limitation: the inner contradiction could surface in more moment-to-moment, scene-level micro-choices rather than largely in summarized evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drive—to preserve the “shape of hope”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to sacrifice some of her humanity for guardianship is well motivated. However, her interior conflict (safety vs wild potential, duty vs human warmth) is more stated than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. The most vivid characterization comes through her sensory attention (dusk, orbs, stone) rather than through layered emotional contradiction under pressure. The final regret is convincing but could land harder if we’d seen more struggle or temptation before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific, with clear tension between her gentleness and the impulse to harden after Silas’s betrayal. Her sequence of “peeling” flattery, guilt, isolation, and fear feels psychologically coherent and grounded in her work with animals. The relationship with Silas exists only in reflection but still credibly drives her current state. The ending veers a bit tidy—her new balance between self-respect and compassion lands smoothly, with limited lingering ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s drive as a “closure seeker who opened wounds” is vivid and consistently dramatized in her decision to reopen her fresh surgical wound and tunnel. Motivation is very clear and embodied, with her methods (coffee rings, scars, telepathy) particular to her. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction under pressure—she doubts briefly but then commits with little competing impulse. The ending shift (from seeking to reading/owning her scars) is earned but somewhat tidy, without much visible cost to her future stance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—finding where “unused love” is stored because of her vanished fiancé—is clear and consistently drives her choices (reading the film strip, prying the panel, pocketing a fragment). Her interiority is vivid but often summarized in abstract terms rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses in the moment. The most compelling beat is her decision to keep a letter fragment (and the knowledge) while planning to return the rest, which hints at a real, if underexplored, moral tension. The piece could push further into her irrational fears or guilt under pressure to reach a more fully earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation (to unblock her creativity via cosmic communion) is clear and consistent, and her actions—leaving the village, working with the astrolabe, resisting then accepting rest—align with it. There is a hint of internal conflict around her fear that “idleness” will kill creativity, but it’s touched rather than deeply dramatized. Emotional life is more conceptual than embodied, leaning on grand images (“stardust imprisoned”) instead of specific, personal texture. The final change—creativity freed—is earned but could carry more visible, character-particular cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guard’s inner shift from numb functionary to “spark-tender” is clear and earned, especially around the moment he clutches the clock and “motivation stirs, unbidden.” However, his interiority stays mostly in the same lyrical register, with limited dramatized contradiction or concrete embodied emotion beyond the metaphoric. The final “dreamless no longer quite so” lands as a credible, if gently drawn, change with some cost to his prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to recover his inner “wild frontier” after becoming a cynical stray) is clear and consistently tied to his choices to follow the hum, pocket the gear, and enter the heartgrove. Interiority is vivid but skewed toward concept and metaphor rather than embodied, moment-to-moment conflict, so the shift away from skepticism reads a bit frictionless. His final transformation feels earned in premise terms but not heavily tested on the page—there’s little genuine resistance or self-sabotage before he gives in to renewal. Still, he reads as a distinct, particular consciousness rather than a stock mystic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s central motivation (seeking unused courage after a life of constraint) is clear and consistent, and the final act of punching the pool edge follows logically from what’s been set up. However, her inner life remains abstract—fear and courage are mostly labeled rather than embodied in specific, character-particular perceptions or contradictory impulses. The “leash’s echo” is a strong image but her actual temptation to return or freeze is never dramatized in a concrete choice. Eldrin and Mira function as archetypal helpers rather than individuated people, limiting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s and Thorne’s arcs are cleanly paralleled: both complicit in “unpardonable silence,” both sheltering in the fortress for safety/atonement, which makes Elias’s final choice to remain feel earned. Embodied details (nerve tingling, frost in Thorne’s eyes, choreographed gestures) give their emotions specificity. The main limitation is that Elias’s realization (“safety was the thief of song…”) comes almost too cleanly, with relatively little on-page resistance or contradiction in the final beat. Still, his motives are coherent and his change is credibly rooted in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lirion’s core motivation and nature are clear and consistent—scholarly, patient, bound to the library—but he reads more as a beautifully-described function than a fully conflicted person. His desire to unmask the pretender is stated and enacted, yet we see almost no internal contradiction, doubt, or cost beyond mild weariness. The lack of on-page struggle (e.g., temptation to intervene more directly, fear of failure, ambivalence about the “true bloodline”) keeps his arc from feeling deep or transformative. The final faint smile is aesthetically satisfying but emotionally thin because no earlier beat has dramatized a competing impulse he must renounce or endure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as a solitary, obsessive observer whose history with the bleaching clearly motivates his present work and his need to understand the vanished paths. His habit of tapping rhythms as mnemonic and liturgy is character-specific and embodied. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or moral tension—he never really wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond loneliness and fatigue. The final choice to broadcast feels earned but not deeply costly at the level of character.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—finding meaning and reigniting the rebellion—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (entering the bay, taking the glasses, touching the stone) all flow from that drive. However, her interiority leans archetypal and declarative (“to discover meaning in the mess of it all”) rather than showing rich, contradictory impulses under pressure. Her doubt about the rebellion’s chaos is mentioned but not dramatized through real hesitation or error. The final transformation from “awkwardly confident” to clarion-call figure feels a touch announced rather than earned through a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is vivid—a former rebel now gardener—with clear, consistent motive, and her actions (digging, unsealing, declaring) align with that. However, her internal conflict about breaking tradition is mostly asserted rather than dramatized; she moves from discovery to decisive action with little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse. Emotional states are largely summarized in elevated language rather than embodied in specific, conflicted moments. The result is compelling but flatter and safer than the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s trauma, vocation, and present-tense choices cohere into a textured, embodied character whose freeze response and later mentorship feel motivated by concrete history. Her reactions to the photograph and the wind are viscerally rendered and consistent with her survivor status. The contradiction between her dissociative freeze and her careful, life-giving work with plants is strong. Some diagnostic/therapy language (“somatic markers,” explicitly invoking her therapist) slightly flattens what is otherwise deeply felt interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias has a clear, specific motivation (to repair his fractured artistic truth) and his actions—searching the shelves, untangling the threads, descending, weaving the loom—track well with that drive. The interiority is vivid and particular, especially around his shame and compulsion toward “necessary darkness.” However, his internal conflict is mostly stated via rhetorical questions rather than dramatized through hard choices or genuine risk of refusal, which softens the sense of cost. The transformation at the end is convincing but comes a bit too cleanly, without much on-page resistance or backsliding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motivation—to understand his crisis-time perception and not lose Mira—is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially when he decides to “merge with the chaos rather than tame it.” The “serene anger” through-line gives him a recognizable emotional texture, even if it’s labeled a bit too often. Mira has less depth but functions well as a catalyst and partial mirror of his stance. The final shift from anger to resolve feels earned, though the psychological cost remains relatively lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role, history, and fractured loyalty are clear, and her central choice—to send the letter—tracks cleanly from those motives. The internal conflict between archival duty and subversion is present on the page, especially around the console, but it’s rendered more in elevated abstractions than in concrete, character-particular detail. Her shift from “bravely conflicted” to “brave complicity” feels earned but somewhat tidy, with little sense of lingering self-deception or blind spots. A few idiosyncratic memories or behaviors under stress would sharpen her from archetype toward individual.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and pacifist stance are clear and consistent, and her choices in the climax (sheathing the dagger, using the roses) align well with those traits. However, the internal conflict around possibly using violence is underdeveloped—she never feels genuinely close to choosing her father’s way, so her renunciation carries limited cost. Her emotional life is more told via symbolic language than embodied (we get more motif than gut). The relationship with Jax turns intriguingly at the end, but his brief on-page presence limits its depth.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, rooted in his fisher’s compulsion and disciplined calm, and his choices (waiting, using silence, gentle hauling) consistently express that nature. The internal tension between his cool-headed discipline and the feral allure of the goddess’s echo is present but underdramatized—he never truly wavers or risks losing control. Embodied emotion appears mainly through externalized calm and bone-deep sensing of shifts, which works but keeps him slightly iconic rather than fully human. The ending suggests an ongoing hunger rather than a resolved arc, which reads as credible Earned Stasis for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is sharply sketched—observant, wry, riven by guilt—and her motive to probe her father’s legacy clearly drives her choices; Harlan’s conflicted guilt is legible but a bit schematic. Her “solemn playfulness” under pressure feels specific and consistent, especially in how she uses logic rather than outrage. Internal contradiction (love vs suspicion, loyalty vs truth) is present but under-dramatized, making the final resolve feel a touch too smooth. The change toward active reclamation of the empire is credible but could cost her more palpably on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt and avoidance are clear and specific, and his profession as a constellation tattooist meaningfully colors his motives and choices. The cradle incident and the silent baby give his guilt a concrete origin rather than abstract angst. However, we mostly get his conflict as declared guilt and “dissonance” rather than embodied, in-the-moment hesitation or self-sabotage. The final change—taking the tattoo onto his own skin—is earned but a little too clean emotionally, with limited sense of lingering conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking meaning in human mess rather than pure catharsis—is clear and consistently rendered, and her social perception is shown through concrete observation of group tensions. Her whimsical/artistic nature is dramatized via the chalk and sand work rather than just labeled. Internal contradiction (creation impulse vs unease about failure) is present but fairly soft, never forcing a truly difficult trade-off. Marta and Theo function mostly as emblems of conflict rather than fully individuated people, so relational cost remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a “gentle radical” is clear and consistent, and the retrocognitive curse adds a concrete cost that fits her main choice. However, her internal conflict under pressure is more declared than dramatized; we’re told the visions chip at her soul, but we don’t see her nearly falter or misstep. Kael’s arc from iron-fisted warlord to weeping penitent is powerful in concept but under-motivated on the page, happening almost instantaneously once the rename hits. The final transformation feels earned enough to work, but still somewhat schematic rather than fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s despair, nostalgia, and latent hunger for performance are clear and specific, and her synesthetic perception gives her interiority a distinct flavor. Her shift from near-collapse to renewed agency is motivated through the coin, the echoes, and Reginald’s offer, though she doesn’t meaningfully resist or wrestle with the cost of hope. Emotional embodiment relies heavily on stylized synesthetic description rather than messier, contradictory impulses under pressure. Reginald’s motivation is legible but sketched, functioning more as a benevolent mechanism than a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply rendered as an “affectionate skeptic,” with clear motive (testing whether love or pills underpin the bond) and embodied unease (“somatic marker” gut twists). Her internal contradiction—yearning for certainty while distrusting the mystical—drives the protocol and blind test credibly. Theo is more of a supportive foil than a full crucible, but his presence does apply gentle pressure on her doubt. The final acceptance of their bond feels earned, though the emotional cost of possibly disproving it could be made more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lira’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (probing the fossil, accepting the floating transformation, training apprentices) align with it. However, her inner life is mostly linear—she moves from curiosity to fulfillment without much contradictory impulse or hard moral calculus. The brief fear of “the void beyond the caves” never forces an agonizing choice. The ending credits her with a lifetime of transformation, but that arc is summarized rather than dramatized under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s vocation, reverence for time, and desire to free the prophecy are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (examining the jar, turning the master hourglass, deciding to ascend) align with that. However, he remains more archetypal custodian than individuated person; we get little contradictory desire or embodied emotional struggle. The “quiet inspiration” is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted impulses. The final choice lands, but with low visible personal cost, which mutes his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by guilt, burnout, and a drive to "fix what's broken," and his final renunciation of active fieldwork in favor of passing the mantle to Lena feels earned. However, his internal conflict is largely asserted rather than dramatized—there’s little sense that the cyanide is a live temptation rather than a symbolic prop. Lena’s fear and latent courage are sketched efficiently, but she risks reading as an archetypal novice more than a fully individuated person. The relationship dynamic (burned veteran vs. unscarred recruit) is strong but could bear more specific, embodied friction in their exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The coachman has a clear, specific motivation (to distill his inherited vows to their essence), and his actions with the tapestry track coherently with that drive. However, his emotional life is oddly frictionless: there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or real doubt as he unpicks generations of oaths. The implied grief and fear around his father and the hill (“vanishing into Gloom Hill's maw”) are gestured at rather than embodied in a way that complicates his serenity. The final serenity therefore feels more like a maintained mood than an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—his “phototropic to kindness” nature is a coherent lens on his choices. However, he faces little visible internal contradiction or pressure; his realization arrives smoothly rather than through struggle. The zen calm barely frays, so the final understanding, while apt, feels more like fulfilment of an existing tendency than a hard-won shift. This limits the felt cost of his insight.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply drawn—a caretaker who redirects her grief into tending both plants and people—and Mira’s guarded despair reads plausibly on the page. Motivation is clear and consistent, especially Elara’s impulse “to reflect light into those dark corners.” However, internal contradiction is relatively soft (Elara rarely feels genuinely torn), and Mira’s shift from extreme isolation to confession happens a bit quickly, sanding off some messiness that would deepen them.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation—turning isolation into independence—is clearly articulated and consistent, but it’s asserted more than it is dramatized through conflicted choices. Her shift from doubt (“Why persist alone?”) to certainty (“Isolation ends here”) happens smoothly, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage. Interiority is present but leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The final transformation into “sovereign archivist” feels more declared than earned through specific, hard decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (lonely keeper of others’ secrets seeking connection and Theo) are clear, embodied in concrete actions like clutching the twig spiral and approaching the installation. Her contradiction—guardian of anonymity vs. hunger to be seen—is present but under-dramatized, as her shift to “revealer” feels emotionally right yet comparatively low-cost on the page. Theo reads more as a projected silhouette than a fully realized agent, though his keeping her letters adds a poignant, specific touch. The relationship change at the end is credible and earned by prior setup, if somewhat smoothly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are clear and specific, and her actions consistently arise from her expertise and desire to protect her community. “Cautiously hopeful” is dramatized through her willingness to try disruption instead of destruction, though internal contradiction and genuine doubt under pressure are only lightly sketched. Harlan functions as a legible but fairly stock secondary force rather than a deeply characterized foil. The final stance—victory with ongoing vigilance—feels earned but could benefit from a sharper felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (rebel against fallow idleness, seek the key, confront claustrophobia) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his internal conflict between fear and defiance is well-articulated in the organ sequence. The prudence vs. rebellion tension shows in pre-mapping the nexus yet choosing to play the organ anyway. However, some emotions are labeled rather than freshly embodied (“claustrophobia clawed at his chest,” “wistful longing”), and the final paragraphs summarize his inner change instead of dramatizing it. The cost of his growth is present but somewhat smoothed over rather than felt as a sharply particular loss.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s characterization is specific and coherent—face blindness, methodical habits, and dormant empathy all tie directly into her choices, especially the decision to use her blood on the ribbon. Motivation (solve Mira’s case, awaken empathy) is clear and consistent. However, her internal conflict is more told than dramatized; we’re informed of her guarded heart and awakening empathy rather than seeing more messy, contradictory impulses on the page. The late segments (aftermath with Mira’s sister, town reaction) flatten her complexity into a near-saintly figure, softening the felt cost of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (reversing her family’s exile and honoring Thorne) is clear, specific, and drives her choices from salvaging the journals to confronting Hale. The “nervously confident” contradiction gives her a credible inner texture, though actual moments of hesitation undercut by bold action could be sharpened further. Hale functions mainly as a plot fulcrum and confessor, with limited depth but adequate pressure for this length. The enduring cost—honor restored but dread and risk persisting—lands as a believable earned stasis in her character stance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator’s grief history, guardedness, and profession as a fiddler create a specific, credible interior, and his micro-choices (pocketing the flake, deciding to play, vowing to follow the trail) align with that. However, his internal conflict between “never” and new possibility is more told than dramatized; we rarely see him genuinely tempted to maintain his old stance. Emotions skew abstract (“pixelated amnesty,” “luminous disbelief”) rather than embodied, which keeps us slightly distant. The final shift toward openness is believable but arrives with little visible cost or resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motives and arc (escaping and then reinterpreting his father’s legacy) are clear and consistent, and his choices at the markers feel grounded in that history. However, his interiority is thin for the stakes; he is almost uniformly “polished calm,” with little on-page contradiction or emotional fraying even as his startup collapses. The relationship with Raoul gives some status and pressure, but Raoul himself is sketched more as a function than a person. The final realization about “fleeting chaos” vs. “enduring harmony” is thematically apt but reads as an articulated thesis rather than a hard-won, messy internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thorne and Lyra’s motives are clear and aligned—decode the glyphs, relieve her burden, honor their pact of shared burdens—but they remain idealized, with little contradiction or genuine flaw. His choice to enter the lucid dream is consistent and motivated, yet it involves minimal ambivalence or cost. The relationship dynamic is warm and supportive but rarely pressured; they don’t have to choose between each other and the work in any meaningful way. The emotional beats land but feel somewhat pre-packaged, with “healed by words” more told than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thorne’s guardedness, guilt, and compulsion to seek truth are clear and consistently dramatized, especially in his hesitation before feeding the seed his own blood. The internal conflict between self-protection and the need to face his betrayal lands convincingly at the moment he chooses pain and revelation. His past sacrifice of the elder concretizes his flaw and raises the moral stakes. The final shift—from self-deception to owning his fracture—feels earned, if a touch neatly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to mend the eclipsed covenant driven by a blend of dread and attraction—is clear and consistent, and her root-bound state gives her a specific constraint. Interiority is concrete in places (“sap-blood mingled, roots within her stirring”), and the repeated “anxious elation” does convey a real, if over-labeled, contradiction of fear/drive. However, internal conflict doesn’t truly sharpen into a dilemma; once she commits to the ritual, there’s little sense she might refuse or fail. The ending’s endurance (still root-bound but newly empowered) is earned but carries only a light felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—grief over her brother and the need to “patch the jagged holes in her soul”—is vivid and consistent, and her choices track cleanly with that drive. The reckless/gentle contradiction is named and lightly dramatized (she works through care rather than force), but her internal conflict remains relatively muted; she rarely doubts or wavers. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes summarized in abstractions (“soul ached with voids”) rather than sharply particular sensations. The closing stance shift to “bridge between worlds” is earned but could register more cost in her body or psychology on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Harl’s motivation (guilt over Jax, career shame, longing for purpose) is clear and consistent, and his appraiser/roadie duality gives him a specific way to process emotion. The moment where he uses appraisal language to fend off grief, then chooses to turn outward and call the foreman, feels earned. However, his inner conflict is a bit too tidily resolved into purpose by the end, with limited sense of residual contradiction or risk. The lack of any on-page relational crucible (Jax and the foreman are off-stage forces) slightly flattens the emotional stakes of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly defined—kind, methodical, haunted by ambition—with concrete behaviors (careful planting, coded tablets, "diluted truths") that align with those traits. His motive to understand the spirit’s departure is coherent and sustained. However, his internal conflict (ambition vs. humility) is mostly asserted rather than forced into sharp on-page choices, so the emotional cost of his final peace feels relatively gentle. The relationship with the mentor-spirit remains more conceptual than dramatized in present-time tension.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s divided nature (archivist vs wild cartographer) is concrete and dramatized through the smelting, and the librarian’s motive is clear and consistent. The internal contradiction is well handled—the orb “riddled with thorns of opposition” is a strong externalization. The emotional journey is a bit smooth; Elara’s fear or resistance could be more embodied at the peak, and the cost of integration feels low. Relationships are functional but not deeply pressured; the librarian is more archetype than fully individuated presence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, history with bunkers, and loss of Mira create a coherent, specific drive that credibly culminates in his choice to transform Epsilon-7. The internal conflict between duty (approving/condemning bunkers) and his belated commitment to connection is clear and tracked through the scene. However, some key motives are stated in thematic shorthand (“to dissolve the walls between hearts”) rather than embodied in more idiosyncratic, in-the-moment perceptions and contradictions. The emotional cost of his earlier failure with Mira could be dramatized a bit more viscerally instead of summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt, obsession with mapping, and recent choice to stop medication give him a clear, specific psychology, and his actions (quadrant search, risky climb, adding to the graffiti) track that interiority well. His emotional life is mostly embodied via the environment and the accordion rather than abstract labels, which works. However, contradictory impulses (self-punishment vs. self-preservation, need for truth vs. desire for absolution) are implied more than dramatized in live tension. The final self-forgiveness lands slightly too smoothly, with limited sense of ongoing cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and persistent—she wants to reach the Library of Unspoken Words—and the “cautious exuberance” tension gives her some internal contradiction, but we don’t see a deep flaw or morally costly choice. Her actions (taking the watch, decoding, documenting) align with her goal yet unfold without serious hesitation or inner rupture. The transformation at the end (“emerged transformed”) is more stated than dramatized through conflicted behavior. Strong, focused characterization, but not yet at the level of fully earned inner change.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core conflict—solitary musical freedom versus inherited imperial duty—is clear, embodied, and consistently motivates her choices, especially in the coffee reading and the final decision at the violin. Her emotions are particularized (“mulberry ache,” bodily tremor, plant-voices) rather than labeled. The ultimate hybrid choice (infusing the empire with her dream rather than rejecting it) feels earned by prior set-up with the plants and provenance work, though the cost of leadership is more implied than viscerally dramatized. A touch more friction or self-deception at the moment of choosing would deepen the sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lirien’s motivation—to capture one last spark before her own oblivion—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in turning the needle on herself. However, her inner conflict between duty to the dead and self-preservation is mostly implied rather than dramatized; she never visibly wavers. Emotion is rendered more through abstracted lyricism than concrete, embodied feeling, which blunts some immediacy. The elder functions purely as a body/stake, not a relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore the grove and find contentment after betrayal—is clear and consistent, and her choices (climbing, taking the pin, performing the rite) align with that drive. However, her emotional conflict around forgiving the unforgivable is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, which blunts complexity. The revelation that she is a reincarnated prior caretaker lands, but her reaction feels more accepting than torn, limiting contradiction. The “kindly decisive” trait appears but rarely forces a visible, costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Alex’s motivation (revenge vs nagging doubt) is clear and sustained, and his change of stance at the end feels causally earned by the lighthouse ritual. Interiority is present but often phrased in generalized, thematic language (“craved nuance,” “certainty is the thief”) rather than character-specific perception. Elias is conceptually interesting but mostly a function—his own desires, limits, or blind spots never complicate the interaction. The final renunciation of revenge has cost (surrendering righteous certainty) but could be sharpened with more embodied resistance and mess.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation (premature aging, pursuit of reversal) is clear and consistent, and Voss’s guarded mentorship has a legible logic, but internal contradiction and real cost are only lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized. Her “realization” about vanishing to appear is thematically apt yet comes a bit too smoothly, without much on-page resistance or messy emotion. Embodied feeling exists (heart pounding, trance sensations) but remains secondary to atmosphere and concept. The relationship dynamic is intriguing but never pushed into a genuinely pressured choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thren’s motivation is clear and specific from the outset—his desire to “navigate without moving” coheres with his reverence and patience across centuries. His actions (refusal to seize the arrowhead rashly, long vigil, final acceptance of the pulse) align with that drive. The cost at the end—his body stilled—is credible and thematically tied to his choices. What holds this below top-tier is a relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or emotional turbulence; he reads more as an archetypal devotee than a fully conflicted individual.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thorne’s motivation—an underachieving, constrained mage desperate to reclaim “the sacred in the simple”—is clear and consistent, and the enchanted bindings give his mediocrity a concrete source. His micro-choices (climbing anyway, unstrapping despite risk, stepping into the vortex) track cleanly with that motive. What’s missing for a higher score is deeper dramatized contradiction: his fear, resentment, and awe are more told than enacted, so the internal struggle never quite bites. The shift from “relic of brilliance dimmed” to quiet rebel feels earned but emotionally under-intense.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief and devotion are clear and specific, and his lamplighter habits are nicely repurposed as emotional motive power. However, his interiority remains fairly one-note—there’s little contradictory impulse or doubt as he heads into a clearly uncanny, potentially lethal situation. Lira is more function than person on the page, which flattens the relational crucible at the climax. The reunion reads emotionally clean, with minimal sense of ongoing flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (“to wavelength align with purpose” and resist stellar doubt) is clear and consistent, and her methodical coin-casting gives her a concrete behavioral signature. However, internal conflict is mostly declared rather than dramatized; the coins are called “infallible,” which undercuts the risk of misinterpretation that could expose deeper contradiction or fear. Her emotions stay in a narrow band of “quiet enthusiasm” with little embodied strain as stakes rise. The final choice to broadcast feels aligned with prior setup but not wrestled with in a way that carries palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motivation—transmuting grief and the “echo of sacrifice” into the power to name and bind monsters—is clear, consistent, and present in her concrete choices. Her reluctance and pain are embodied in details like the dulled scythe and trembling hands, not just labels. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; once she commits to naming, the process feels a bit too smooth, with little in-the-moment backsliding or irrationality. The closing assertion that she is “heartbroken no more” reads slightly tidy for the depth of loss invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elowen’s motivation and internal contradiction—lukewarm skill vs brittle but fervent devotion—are clear and consistently dramatized, especially when his first repair fails and his faith nearly cracks. His emotions are embodied through fatigue, shaking hands, and sputtering spells, not just labels. However, the text leans on repeated abstractions (“lukewarm,” “earnestly naive,” “brittle devotion”) rather than more idiosyncratic, situation-specific perceptions to deepen him. The closing shift from brittle to resilient vow is earned but a bit too neatly articulated in theme-language.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is specific and coherent: a guilt-driven, “precisely humane” warden whose long-term vigilance credibly stems from a formative failure, and his actions (following the photos, confessing to Mira, choosing a ritual of burning) all align with that psychology. The backstory of his mistake and his mother’s death dovetails cleanly with the resurfacing town. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page—he moves fairly smoothly from haunted to lighter without much in-scene resistance. Mira functions more as a listening vessel than a full counter-presence, so the relational crucible is gentler than the premise could bear.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s core contradiction—rigorous, logic-driven alchemist vs “secretly sentimental” keeper of faded letters—is clear and dramatized rather than merely stated. Her motivation (to harmonize logic and intuition before transformation) stays coherent and drives each ritual choice. Tears at the starlings’ patterns and her shift from relying on formulas to accepting intuitive signs make the final inner reconfiguration earned. The main limitation is that there’s little sense of genuine risk to her psyche in the moment, so the cost of failure remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn as hyper-competent yet burdened, with motivation rooted in preserving Lena’s trust and the lives below. His stress is embodied (buckle-twisting, chest clench) rather than merely labeled, and his professional mindset feels specific. The internal contradiction—need for flawless foresight vs awareness of fragility and isolation—lands, especially in the closing reflection. The only gap at this tier is that his flaw (isolation / over-burden) never forces a costly compromise on the page; his competence goes largely unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s motivation (ending his numbness by reclaiming/merging with the clone) is clear and drives his choices, and Elara’s fear of losing Collective control provides a credible opposing motive. However, Kai’s interiority leans abstract (“ego death,” “void”) and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure—he rarely seems genuinely torn or destabilized in the moment. The final shift from numbness to wholeness is earned conceptually but emotionally compressed. Elara remains more of an articulated function (Collective dogma) than a fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motive—to protect his escape-room haven—is clear and consistent, and his puzzle-solving competence feels character-specific. However, he experiences little genuine internal conflict or contradiction; he’s largely serenely capable throughout. The “notably receptive” trait is told rather than tested against fear, doubt, or temptation. His final vow reads as an affirmation more than a hard-won shift, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s core motivation—restoring the household’s laughter—is clear, consistent, and drives every action, and his role as “leaf blower symphony conductor” feels specific rather than generic. However, his interiority is mostly implied through stance and repetition of “mournfully eager,” with little contradictory impulse or moral friction. The ghosts function more as a collective audience than as individuated pressures. The final “tending complete” beat feels earned but emotionally simple rather than deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The guardian’s motives (homesickness vs. strategic embrace of uncertainty) are clear and consistent, and the internal conflict between feral instinct and lucid resolve is nicely dramatized (“I lunged not in rage, but welcome”). However, emotional complexity remains mostly at the conceptual level; we get rich metaphors but relatively few concrete, idiosyncratic behaviors that would individualize this creature beyond its role. The cultist as a figure is thin, functioning more as a device than a character, which limits relational pressure. The final choice to absorb him and step through the portal feels motivated but not deeply costly in embodied terms.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—his shift from resigned failure to radical risk is credibly built through the three failed attempts. The “stoically sensitive” quality is mostly told but does appear in his unflinching procedure paired with acute emotional pangs. Internal conflict is present but a bit schematic (he rarely feels genuinely torn, more steadily discouraged-then-enlightened). The final leap to “total creative destruction” feels earned but not deeply conflicted, which limits the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and method (“to find the beginning in every ending” and tuning by discarding assumptions) are clear, specific, and drive her choices. We see a credible mental process as she sheds maps, codes, bitterness, and even her own creed. However, her emotions are mostly conceptual rather than embodied; she reads as competent and steady with minimal visible struggle under pressure. The change at the end is more confirmation/clarification of her worldview than a costly internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s optimism and devotion to the Dawn Runner are clear and consistent, and his decision to act through the radio is well motivated by those traits. However, he faces little genuine internal contradiction—his positivity is never seriously troubled or made morally costly. The parallel, dour Elias provides a glimpse of contrast, but that tension resolves very quickly and cleanly. The final “merge” feels more like a neat wrap than a hard-won, conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand the “texture of connection”—is clear and sustained, and his actions (choosing to weave, escalating the patterns, enduring the eruption) align with it. However, his interior life remains largely abstracted (“texture,” “connection,” “rational enchantment”) rather than grounded in idiosyncratic, embodied contradictions, so we don’t feel real risk or self-betrayal in his choices. The altered memories (mother, brother, wife) are conceptually strong but under-dramatized as living relationships, so they function more as thematic devices than relational crucibles. The endpoint shift is credible but relatively cost-light, reading more like a designed revelation than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kai’s primary motivation (to learn starlight navigation) is clear and consistent, and Elara’s “balanced curiosity” comes through in her measured instruction. However, internal contradiction or real emotional conflict under pressure is minimal; Kai never hesitates or doubts, and Elara’s shadowed caution doesn’t force a concrete choice. The relationship is interesting but under-tested—no status shift or sharp interpersonal pressure occurs. The closing hint that such navigation “contracts the soul’s familiar anchors” is evocative but lands more as concept than as a dramatized personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (protecting “vulnerable voices”) and trait of dangerous curiosity are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially staying late and using the hearing aid despite rules. Clara’s arc from suicidal resolve to tentative re-engagement with life is legible, if somewhat compressed. Emotional states are mostly embodied (mist, stone, railing, sobbing) rather than labeled. However, internal contradiction and genuine moral ambiguity are limited; characters feel real but slightly idealized, especially in the clean, unmessy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to honor the unremembered despite crippling claustrophobia) is clear, consistent, and embodied in specific physical reactions (“belly to stone,” “walls closing in like a vice”). Her fear and purpose act as simultaneous, contradictory impulses that drive credible choices, especially in using the codex despite panic in the liminal phase state. The inner life stays somewhat generalized at times (“phobia clawing at her chest,” “heart hammering”), which keeps the characterization from feeling fully singular. The final shift—she carries a scarred phobia but lighter heart—reads as an earned endurance rather than a dramatic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and nicely rooted in her “death certificate error” history and compulsive heartbeat-counting. Her actions—seeking the observatory, engaging with Lir, choosing to help—align cleanly with that motive. The interiority is vivid but largely linear; she doesn’t visibly wrestle with contradictory impulses (e.g., fear of becoming a ghost herself vs. desire to engage the archive) in the moment. The final shift toward accepting her survival as “no error” is earned but could carry more bite if a renounced alternative were more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thorne’s core motivation—preserving a tactile language—is clear, consistent, and drives his choices from taking the cursed diamond to entering the tunnel, but his interiority remains more emblematic than deeply conflicted. We get stakes and determination, yet little embodied emotional contradiction when he risks madness or faces the last elders’ deaths. The final endurance/sacrifice feels earned but emotionally under-dramatized on the page. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully immersive literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief and bitterness are specific and convincingly rooted in her brother’s transformation, and her motivation “to turn that bitterness into a cosmic joke” is clear and consistent. Her interiority, however, stays relatively one-note—she moves from entrenched resentment to acceptance very quickly once the phone and her brother’s voice appear, with little dramatized resistance in the peak beat. The brother functions largely as a catalytic symbol rather than a fully pressured relationship on the page. The final change feels earned enough for this length but could use one sharper moment of simultaneous push–pull (clinging to bitterness even as she lets go) to achieve top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation is clear and consistently dramatized—she wants to reawaken beauty in a mechanized orchard—and her method (music, heart-rhythm signaling) aligns with that. However, she encounters little genuine internal conflict or hesitation; there’s no moment where competing impulses (fear vs. drive, self-preservation vs. risk) are in live tension. Her success arrives without visible psychological or moral cost, which flattens the arc. The characterization is strong for this length but not yet searching or contradictory enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to subvert the border in order to heal broken promises—is clear, specific, and threaded from opening to closure. His professional competence and quiet rebellion are shown in concrete behaviors (manifest performance, deference to guards, meticulous sorting). The lost bride backstory is efficiently sketched and meaningfully reweights his present choices rather than feeling like bolt-on exposition. What keeps this shy of the very top band is the relative lack of in-scene internal contradiction or sharp moment of moral friction under pressure; he rarely feels genuinely torn.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, vow of silence, and reverence for forgotten carousels are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (entering the train, prying the fragment free, restoring the carousel) align neatly with those motives. However, his inner life is largely stated rather than dramatized, and we rarely feel contradictory impulses or real strain as he breaks his longstanding vow in song. The “cost” of that shift—what he risks by changing his relationship to silence—remains abstract. This keeps the arc moving but limits its emotional depth at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliza’s motivation—to reach the place where stories live via analog memory—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her habits and expertise. Her sanity/eccentricity balance is nicely embodied in her physical rituals with the scarf and geometry rather than just told. However, internal contradiction and on-page emotional struggle are only lightly sketched; the temptation of “full immersion” is mentioned rather than really felt through her body and thought. The closing choice to refold the scarf and continue her quest later reads credible but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing to recapture the runaway dream is clear, consistent, and drives every choice from opening to closure. Her grief and fixation are well embodied in tactile actions (odd hours, tending the library, working with the palette), though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in simultaneous impulses. We rarely see her actively tempted to *stop* or to choose a different path, which flattens potential complexity. The Earned Stasis at the end—accepting the dream as image, not return—is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivations for both woman and locksmith are clear and consistent (freeing ideas from fear, his own deferred freedom), and his final turn toward unlocking himself is earned. However, interiority stays abstract—“improbable longing,” “fear,” “truth”—rather than embodied or particular to her psyche. We get very little sense of her contradictory impulses beyond generic desperation and awe. The emotional change lands conceptually but without the textured, character-specific struggle expected at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives (age, failed hands, need for closure) are clear and grounded in specific biographical detail, and his “hands-on” nature is shown in how he wades in, brushes silt, and physically engages the ring. The emotional throughline from professional habit to personal reckoning is convincing. What’s thinner is active internal contradiction—there’s little on-page push-pull between fear and desire beyond implied risk, so his change reads more as consummation than contested choice. Still, the final reclamation and quiet renunciation of his old life feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s combative tenderness and nervous backward-walking are consistently dramatized, and Kai’s arc from trembling uncertainty to steadied resolve tracks cleanly with the pressure she applies. Their dynamic has clear status gradients and a lived-in history, with hints of Elara’s own exile enriching her motives. However, Kai’s inner life feels comparatively thin—his fears and desires are more told than embodied—so his decisive success at the sigil reads slightly under-struggled. The emotional cost for Elara of letting him go is implied but could be sharpened with one more concrete, conflicted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lirien’s motivation and role as caretaker are clear and consistent, and Elowen’s despair provides a concrete foil, but both remain more archetypal than deeply individuated. Interiority is largely implied through lofty diction rather than specific, character-particular thought or embodied contradiction. Lirien never faces a real dilemma or visible cost; his competence is unchallenged. The final choice to give the seed is thematically apt but emotionally easy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirien’s motivation—to ground spirits and atone for his brother’s loss—is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the fisherman's shade has a distinct, if simple, presence. However, Lirien rarely experiences simultaneous contradictory impulses; once the secret is revealed, he only intensifies along a single vector of duty. His grief about his brother is evoked more as premise than dramatized inner conflict under pressure. The ending shift from “lucid unrest” to “quiet resolve” is earned but a bit declarative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and coherent: a meticulous, grief-marked map framer whose guardedness and curiosity clearly drive his actions. His motivation to "interpret silence with empathy" is embodied in choices like muting the footage, emailing only a single still, and pocketing just one letter. The internal conflict between shieldedness and the pull to reveal is present but mostly told rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment contradiction. His final faint smile and re-framing act read as an earned, if gently drawn, shift.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is sharply sketched as solitary, cerebral, and in an oddly collegial relationship with Death; her motivation (“to understand the physics of letting go”) is coherent with her behavior. Interiority is textured and particular, especially in how she filters everything through scientific metaphor. However, genuine internal contradiction is muted—there’s little on-page struggle between competing impulses, so the final conceptual shift feels more like a continuation than a hard-won conflict. The cost of her stance (or of shifting it) remains largely abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen’s core motivation—to give voice to unspoken needs—is clear and organically linked to her history as a seldom-heard balladeer. Her choices (climbing to the courtyard, engaging with the ghost, using the plate) all align cleanly with this drive. However, she experiences little real resistance or internal contradiction; the path from recognition to solution is mostly frictionless. The lack of a visible cost or hard choice at the end keeps the characterization from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira is clearly drawn as warmly inquisitive and emotionally tethered to Elowen, and her decision to keep reading under mounting pain feels motivated. However, internal contradiction is muted—she rarely seems truly tempted to stop or to reject the revelation, which flattens potential complexity. Her acceptance of being the hidden child comes very smoothly, with little dramatized struggle or cost. The relationship with Elowen is powerful but entirely mediated by the diary, so relational pressure on the page is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, vocation, and obsession are clearly and consistently motivated, and his final acceptance of the gondola as “eternal observatory” grows credibly from those traits. Interiority is specific (Lira’s loom, tapestries, aneurysm-as-string) rather than generic grief. Internal contradiction is present but muted—he’s uneasy yet quickly “embraces the chaos,” so competing impulses under pressure could be sharper. The closing renunciation of survival options is emotionally legible but could register with a more explicit felt cost in his body or fear, not just in concept.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and perceptual quirks are specific and well-embedded: her prosopagnosia, focus on posture/light, and drive to “mirror the sky” all feel integrated and character-particular. Her competence under pressure—using portrait skills to meet fractal precision—flows logically from what we’re told about her. Internal contradiction (fear of limits vs compulsion to push past them) is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment doubt or error. The emotional cost of anonymity and the library’s loss lands, but her inner struggle during the crafting sequence remains relatively smooth and untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—her curiosity and chatter drive her toward the hopscotch board and through decoding it. However, she reads as almost entirely competent and buoyant; there’s little visible contradiction or cost in her sociable isolation or her hunger for discovery. Her grief over her mentor and the vanished crew is mentioned but not really dramatized under pressure. The final stance shift (“isolation now a launchpad”) feels emotionally plausible but lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—recovering his father’s “rhythm of repair”—is clear, consistent, and drives every action. His emotional life is present and embodied through sensory recall (breath crystallizing, gear-clinks as memories), though it leans more toward lush description than sharply conflicted impulses. The internal change from ache to “anchor” reads earned and ties back to the initial longing. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of contradiction or risk in his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivations are clear (save the orchards; learn to trust Lir), but they’re largely stated in summary rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. The four survivors blur somewhat together, with only light differentiation beyond job labels and a few lines of dialogue. Internal conflict—especially Mira’s fear and Kael’s skepticism—never fully crystallizes into embodied, in-scene struggle. The final unity feels plausible but not deeply earned at the level of individual psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s role, history, and core vow are clear and emotionally grounded, and his final act of singing through the pane feels motivated and earned. His loneliness and tenderness toward the puppet head give him specificity beyond a stock “eternal guardian.” However, his internal conflict is muted; he rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses, so the arc reads more as fulfillment than pressured change. A bit more lived ambivalence undercutting his resolve would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is vivid and specific—a gruff, reluctant caretaker whose inherited duty and buried guilt clearly drive his choice to help. His interior conflict (resentment vs compulsion to save others) is present but sketched more by repetition of “reluctance” than by layered, scene-level contradictions. His micro-choices during the marking sequence track well with his motives and history. Secondary characters are purely functional silhouettes, but that suits this length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt, professional pride, and grief are clearly motivated and specific, and his occupation meaningfully colors his perceptions and choices. The turn from destroyer to would-be redeemer feels earned by the accumulated remorse. However, internal conflict after the insight is too smooth—once he “sees,” there’s little resistance, ambivalence, or irrational backsliding, and “grief fully loosened” reads emotionally tidy. The lack of a truly costly or morally knotted on-page choice keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation—to locate the place where stories begin—tracks cleanly into his ritual, and the tallying of absences is a distinctive, character-specific mode of thinking. However, his emotional life is rendered more conceptually than viscerally, with relatively little embodied contradiction or stress on the page as he cuts deeper. His final renunciation of the vendor role is credible but feels more allegorical than psychologically pressured. A bit more concrete, felt conflict between staying (serving customers) and descending would raise this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elaris’s guilt, self-imposed isolation, and compulsion to “sandpaper” memories are vivid and consistent, and his occupational lens (tasting memories) personalizes his interiority. His choice to subsume the pavilion’s remorse grows credibly from those traits. However, his internal conflict at the decisive moment reads a bit too smooth; there’s limited on-page struggle or contradictory impulse when the cost spikes. The resolution is emotionally satisfying but edges toward tidy acceptance rather than fully dramatized complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—her “empathetically decisive” nature is dramatized in rallying crews and stepping onto the bridge to conduct the multilingual chorus. However, she’s almost entirely idealized; there’s little sense of internal contradiction, fear, or cost, so her arc reads more like an enactment of virtue than a pressured evolution. Her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied under stress. The ending gives her triumph but not much visible trade-off or scar.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to reinvent herself as an “archaeologist of abandoned dreams”—is clear, consistent, and pays off in her final vow and transformed state. Her engineer’s precision and helix-obsessed cognition are dramatized through how she manipulates the mirror and maps light to memory. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; she rarely hesitates or resists, so cost and contradiction feel muted. Emotional experience skews conceptual over embodied, which slightly flattens the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s goal and competence are clear, and her “prism-minded” perception gives her a mildly distinctive inner lens. However, her emotional life remains abstract (“latent blaze,” “seeds of vigilance”) with little concrete embodiment or contradictory impulse under pressure. She encounters no serious doubt, fear, or temptation that forces a revealing choice. The ending shift to “beacon” is conceptually motivated but not earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s core motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions all align with the drive to make music in a silenced world. Interiority is present in how he reads the trees and sculpture, but his inner life remains largely idealized and unconflicted, with little sense of flaw or competing impulse. The emotional progression through the performance is convincing, yet he ends essentially the same person with only a modest deepening of resolve. The piece gains from his specific empathy and craft, but lacks a sharper internal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and specific: the exiled tutor whose love of difficult beauty, grief for his father, and quiet stubbornness all register in how he moves and thinks. His motives (mend the covenant, redeem his lesson, honor the dented stone) clearly drive his actions at the nexus. Internal contradiction—melancholy vs. hope, reverence vs. disillusionment with the court—is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure. The final endurance (covenant stirred but exile unchanged) feels earned and costs him, emotionally, on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vividly drawn—eclectic, pacifist, ex-medic, ritualistic—and his motivation to catalog silences is coherent and persistent. His actions (inventing and using the tuner, addressing the diary theatrically) clearly arise from those traits. However, his internal life lacks real contradiction or friction under pressure; he largely behaves as his own rhetoric predicts. The closing stance feels more like confirmation than change, limiting the depth of character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s ambition, hypersensitive nose, and desire for serenity are clearly established and consistently drive her actions. Her internal conflict—seeking calm while pursuing something violently disruptive to her senses—feels specific and embodied in the tending of the corpse flower. The decisive change from conquest to harmony is motivated by her ordeal at the bloom. The main limitation is that her final serenity comes a bit quickly and cleanly, with little lingering ambivalence or visible long-term cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation (family loss, famine, failing groves) is clear, concrete, and consistently drives her physical choices. Competence is well-established through her piloting and method of navigating inversion, giving her a specific professional texture. What’s missing at this level is a sharper internal conflict—she barely hesitates over wrenching the arrow from the planet, so we lose a chance to see contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending change (becoming the carrier of resilience) is earned causally but lands with relatively little visible emotional cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear, consistent professional motivation and a distinct perceptual lens, but there’s little internal contradiction or genuine struggle—he’s competent, calm, and rarely strained. His emotional life stays largely abstract (purpose, foresight) rather than embodied. The flight engineer’s patch adds a hint of personal charge, yet it doesn’t expose conflicting impulses in him. The ending stance as “sentinel” feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elyra’s motivation—to “certify wonder as essential”—is clear, consistent, and present from start to finish. Her doubt vs. drive creates some genuine internal pressure, especially around the decision to ring the bell. However, the conflict remains relatively undifferentiated emotionally; we don’t see specific personal costs or contradictions beyond generic hesitation. The final choice feels earned but not deeply surprising because the story never fully tests her values.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elaron’s motivation is clear and consistent—atonement and insight after failure—and his actions (markers, journey, flute-playing) align with that drive. Interiority is present but leans archetypal and declarative rather than deeply particularized. The realization that isolation was his flaw feels a bit neat and told rather than fully dramatized in on-page contradiction. Still, the closing shift from shame to hard-won purpose reads earned within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn—a fusion of fanatic curiosity and eerie detachment—whose borrowing of Mira’s personality creates a credible, costly misfire. His motivation (“the mathematics of emotion”) is consistent and drives concrete choices with embodied fallout (staggering under her terror). Mira is more schematic but still has a clear arc from terror to obsessive understanding and back. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen: Elias reaches insight and equilibrium very quickly for someone just drowned in cosmic dread.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s jitteriness, long history as a courier, and devotion to “coax wonder from the routine” create a coherent, specific interior life, and his choice to offer the pendant feels well motivated. The embodied detail of his nerves settling when he touches the pendant grounds his emotions. Internal contradiction is present but light—there’s not much real struggle between keeping the relic and risking it, so the cost of his generosity doesn’t fully bite. Lira is efficiently sketched and functions well as a foil, but her inner conflict is largely glimpsed via the pendant rather than dramatized through her own choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s blend of empiricist and mystic is sharply etched, and his core misbelief—calling mysticism “metaphor”—credibly drives both his experiment and his self-deception. The moment the frost writes “Eliza” and *Feel me* forces him to confront guilt and repression lands as a motivated, character-specific break. Interiority is rich and embodied via tools and environment rather than abstract labels, though a few lines (“Not madness, but merger”) slip toward summary statement. The final stance—still publishing in “academic hush” while privately converted—offers a believable, costly contradiction rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—sending a message across realms—is clear and consistently drives her actions, culminating in the choice to complete the rite at the cost of her life. However, her interiority remains relatively one-note (wistful, sacrificial) with little dramatized contradiction or moment-to-moment micro-conflict. The traded voice and latent sacrifice are strong traits but mostly summarized rather than enacted in varied ways. The final renunciation feels earned but could gain power from more textured inner conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s motivation is clear and specific—grief over the shaft collapse and a craftsman’s need to rescue his world from rubble—so his actions feel grounded. The meek exterior vs “quietly determined” interior gives him dimensionality, and his occupational lens remains consistent. What’s missing at this level is a live, on-page contradiction or real dilemma under pressure; once he decides to use the silk, there’s no serious internal conflict or competing value. The closing stance shift from “meek shadow” to “architect of azure rebellion” is earned but a touch declarative rather than dramatized through a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to learn the withheld truth of her origins—is clear and sustained, and her responses to each revealed universe (nostalgia, suspicion, betrayal, acceptance) track credibly. Her identity as a “sensory map maker” is distinctive and shapes her perceptions, though often more told than dramatized through concrete micro-choices. Internal conflict exists (relief vs. burden; trust vs. doubt about the mentor) but is rarely pressed into a sharp, present-tense dilemma on the page. The final acceptance of her role feels earned conceptually but could land harder if a viable alternative (refusal, sabotage) were made more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias and Harlan are clearly individuated, with Elias’s reticence and quiet care paying off in his decision to write a note and “protect” the chain. Motivation—seeking or offering safety in a hostile environment—is coherent and specific to both men. Emotional embodiment is mostly via physical detail and action rather than labels. Internal contradiction in Elias (leaving vs. protecting) is present but only lightly dramatized, keeping this short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motive and persona are vivid—his “shadowed elation” and boredom with rote storm-steering credibly drive his choice to weaponize the lighthouse. However, he remains largely a single-register figure (manic glee) with limited on-page contradiction or struggle. The shift from guiding storms for sailors to summoning world-altering shadows feels asserted rather than wrestled with. We don’t see a real cost to him personally, so the final triumph lacks inner complication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s motivation—to understand the story-magnetism of her new heart—is clear, consistent, and concretely tied to her craft and habits of observation. Her interiority is particular (“noted how the light began its slow crawl,” “question quietly explosive”) and mostly dramatized rather than labeled. The tension between attraction to stories and fear of being overwhelmed is present but never fully pressured into a difficult on-page choice. Secondary characters don’t apply real crucible pressure; the storyteller at the end affirms her stance rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and longing “to discover what trees witnessed” give him a clear, particular center, and his actions all align with that quiet curiosity. Interiority is vivid but skewed toward lyric observation rather than conflicted impulses, so we rarely feel him pulled between incompatible values. The final realization about the trees lands more as a graceful insight than a hard-won shift with visible cost. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the depth or contradiction level of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motive—to rekindle the realm and reweave community—is clear and consistent, and her role as “scattered memory keeper” is meaningfully tied to her tactics. However, she encounters little real inner contradiction or doubt; the pain and memory-scattering are noted but don’t create a serious crisis of will. Her emotional life is more archetypal than particular, leaning on role and function over idiosyncratic reaction. The final alignment of her memories feels largely declarative rather than dramatized through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—regret over ignoring the first summons and a desire to redeem that mistake—is clear and credibly drives her choice to help the young man and re-enter the Order. Her interiority shows some contradiction (reclusive yet drawn toward connection), but the decision to commit to the Order comes almost too smoothly, with little real resistance under pressure. The young man is more a catalyst than a character, with minimal depth or agency. The final transformation into “eternal guardian” feels a bit declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is sharply etched: a quiet, guilt-ridden observer whose guerrilla gardening and ritualized bread-eating concretely dramatize his need for redemption. His passivity in the bakery’s decline credibly haunts him and fuels the scene, and his gentleness in receiving Mira (bread offered immediately, no defenses) feels psychologically true. The sibling dynamic is efficient yet rich, with their shared habits (tracing knots in the table) and family history making the reconciliation plausible rather than sentimental. A touch more in-scene contradiction—his resentment or defensiveness surfacing before yielding to guilt—would deepen the complexity at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s role and motivation are clear and consistent—he is an orderly archivist trying to salvage fading vows—but his interior life is thin. Apart from “his heart quickened,” we get little embodied emotion or contradiction between duty and fear, so his success feels more procedural than costly. His micro-choices (which frequency to sample, how to calibrate) fit his role but never expose a real internal conflict. The final “smiled faintly” registers as a small, unsurprising beat rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motivation (avenge father / capture the sound of trust breaking) is vivid and consistent, and her tactics under pressure track plausibly through the false starts to the final gambit. Interiority is concrete if somewhat single-note—her “curiously steadfast” drive is asserted more than it’s interrogated, with limited lived contradiction or self-sabotage. Her choices clearly drive the plot, but we don’t see much moral or emotional ambivalence about shattering the truce or endangering others. The endurance at the end feels earned, though the personal cost to her psyche could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skepticism, bioluminescent rebellion, and sensory quirk make her feel specific, and her drive “to learn why some people carried weather with them” cleanly motivates the scene. Her shift from doubt to awe is earned by the encounter, but her internal conflict (skepticism vs yearning) is more implied than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The weather-walkers, especially the mist-man, function more as exposition sources than fully pressuring presences. The change is real yet relatively low-cost, keeping this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation to reclaim his art and undo his past self-betrayal is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. His mnemonic gift and accountant persona add specificity, though internal conflict is more told than dramatized in live, conflicting impulses. Emotional embodiment (trembling hands, mocking echoes) is effective but somewhat generalized. The final shift to sketching “freely” feels earned, if a bit tidy and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive—to locate “lost conversations” and live in proximity to truth because lies literally make her wilt—is clear, consistent, and carried into concrete choices (following the map, enduring the bazaars, sharing the vault’s secret). Her emotional life is embodied (physical wilting, breath shallow, knees buckling) and particular to this world. However, her inner conflict remains relatively one-directional (she rarely wants something that conflicts with her truth-compulsion), which slightly flattens complexity at an otherwise rich climax with the mentor’s confession. The relationships on the page are evocative but mostly symbolic rather than crucibles that force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her actions (choosing to shape the iceberg, dedicating herself to constant tuning) align with that. However, she borders on emblematic rather than fully human; there’s little contradiction or specific, embodied emotional struggle under pressure. Her seasonal muteness and history are stated rather than deeply dramatized in scene. The ending endurance feels conceptually earned but emotionally under-detailed for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zeta’s motivation (preserve the farm / resolve inner static) is clear and consistently drives choices, from opening nostalgia to the decision to burn the box. The internal conflict between fear and resolve is on the page (“hide, run, resolve”), though it could be deepened with more embodied, character-specific texture. The final change—accepting a fragmented wholeness after destroying the fear-relics—feels earned by prior beats. Still, Zeta’s interiority sometimes reads as thematic summary rather than moment-to-moment, pressured thought.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena’s motivation—to prove that listening heals—is clear and consistently enacted, and her calm, curator-like discernment tracks through her choices. However, her interior life remains relatively thin; we get little in the way of contradictory impulses, doubt, or personal cost. Secondary characters (Ruiz, Liang, Tomas, Chen) function more as thematic voices or clue-deliverers than as pressured individuals. The final “vindication” of her creed feels somewhat pre-assured rather than wrestled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal and backstory are clear and consistent, and her “calm defiance” gives her a specific emotional texture. However, she faces little real internal contradiction in the moment; once underwater, she executes her plan with near-total competence and minimal psychological friction. Her motivation to reclaim and reframe her “poetic madness” is strong, but rarely complicates choices on the page. The reunion with colleagues hints at relational stakes but arrives too late and too cleanly to deepen her characterization much.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s desire to recover deleted memories is clear and consistently drives his choices from abandoning his rounds to embedding the heart. His interiority, though present (wildflowers, deleted meadow), skews more declarative than deeply conflicted—he rarely wavers or doubts under pressure. Emotional embodiment is decent but not piercing; grief and awe are gestured at more than dramatized. The final shift into “guardian of the unseen” is earned but somewhat summarized rather than felt through a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—to hush the coded prophecy—is clear and consistent, and his competence as a summoner is well established, but he rarely feels psychologically particular beyond that role. Interiority is mostly carried by elevated diction rather than character-specific thought or contradiction, so we don’t see him genuinely doubt, fear failure, or wrestle with alternative choices. The line “motivation unyielding; to let it speak unchecked would unravel the world's delicate balance” states resolve but doesn’t dramatize cost or hesitation. As a result, his final relieved departure feels earned in plot terms but emotionally underpowered.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation and throughline are clear and consistent, and the relationship with Harlan has a believable, if somewhat summarized, evolution from sugar-borrowing to confessional rooftop scene. However, her interior conflict is underdeveloped—she almost never wavers between wanting the truth and fearing its cost, so the final demand “Teach me fully” feels more like a step on a straight path than a pressured choice. Harlan has intriguing hints (the familiar smile, the concealed seal, the “humoring” of her), but his contradictions and deeper cost in yielding the secret are only lightly sketched. The change at the end is meaningful but lands with relatively low visible emotional price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motives (escaping consuming grief by “translating isolation into independence”) are clear, consistent, and organically tied to her traits as both “charmed skeptic” and mourner. Her internal conflict between doubt and the charm’s pull appears in key beats, especially when the shell whispers “He waits beyond the waves” and she pushes through anyway. The climax choice—to undergo the archive ritual despite fear it might drown her anew—feels earned by prior setup. The emotional shift at the end (tragic radiance → tempered inner light) lands as a credible change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—revenge for an abandoned apprenticeship evolving into a need for forgiveness—and his history as a forger is concretely sketched. However, on the page he rarely feels internally divided; the ritual unfolds with almost no moment where revenge and release genuinely pull against each other in real time. The emotional states are largely summarized (“wisely enduring,” “revenge… chained the soul”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses during the rite. The final renunciation is conceptually earned but not deeply contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elyra’s motivation (to solve the riddle of echoes and manage the pact) is clear and consistent, and her perceptiveness is dramatized in how she reads the merchant. However, internal conflict is limited—she rarely feels genuinely torn, and her competence smooths over potential ambiguity. The final realization about perception feels earned conceptually but not deeply contested emotionally. Secondary characters are sketched as types, though they do apply relevant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to salvage something pure from wreckage—is clear and consistently embodied in her behavior, especially in how she handles the ghosts and the locket. Interiority is mostly conveyed through her ritual actions and sensory focus rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps her slightly abstract. The careful-weaver-of-truth trait is dramatized in her incremental assembling of clues, not just told. However, there is little on-page ambivalence or internal contradiction; she rarely feels genuinely torn, which flattens the emotional stakes of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kai is specific and memorable—a contemplative craftsman whose actions (whisking tea, following moon paths, mending the net) all align cleanly with his values. His motivation to honor hidden labor is clear and consistently embodied. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or a choice with real emotional cost; he moves through the night with serene certainty. The result is strong, textured characterization but not yet transformative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation as a professional debunker is clear and consistently drives his actions, and the late internal conflict—realizing that truth might be dangerous here—feels earned. The small, concrete choices (crossing the threshold, methodically reconstructing letters, re-burying the diamond) reveal a hierarchy of values without over-explaining. Some interiority leans on generic phrasing (“His motivation burned,” “mind racing”) rather than fully particularized embodiment. Still, his final renunciation reads as a credible, costly shift rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s drive and loneliness are clear and consistent, and his motivation (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) plausibly underpins his actions. However, interior complexity is thin: doubt appears late and briefly, and we rarely see contradictory impulses playing at once. Mira is more a function than a character, so the relational crucible never quite bites. The final defiance in the face of the warning feels conceptually right but not deeply earned by prior internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s core motivation—redemption by “translating between generations”—is clear and consistently embodied in his actions with the jars and the fishers’ family. Interiority is concrete and particular (his response to the music box, the imagined grandchildren at markets). However, internal contradiction is relatively mild: doubt is mentioned (“Had the loft’s feral grip claimed too much of him?”) but not deeply dramatized in scene. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, with limited sense of a foreclosed alternative self.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect the key and use it as he once did for his lover—and his choice to adapt rather than use brute force tracks with his “logically emotional” nature. However, his interiority leans more on reiterated labels and sensualized description than on genuinely contradictory impulses under pressure. The backstory of the saved lover is potent but underdeveloped; it informs motive without quite becoming a live emotional crucible in the scene. His change at the end reads more as cathartic relief than a difficult renunciation with visible cost, which slightly flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and consistent—her impatience versus Kai’s doctrine of patience is dramatized through concrete choices (waiting for the freeze, timing the moon, controlled sabotage). Interiority is vivid and specific (“her heart a storm restrained”), and the prior botched scout giving cost to her restraint feels earned. The internal contradiction between wild impulse and disciplined planning persists into the climax and resolves credibly into a new equilibrium. Minor softness: a few lines state her transformation somewhat overtly rather than letting behavior alone carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her profession, with the Underground Railroad visions smartly mirroring her own entrapment. Her “watchful calm” and empirical bent feel character-particular, and her final choices (destroying the phone, calling for a restraining order) are motivated by the accumulating parallels with Lila. Internal conflict is present but a bit under-pressured; fear of Marcus’s retaliation and lingering attachment are mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized. The change at the end is convincing, though slightly swift for the depth of control implied.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt and need for atonement are clear, specific, and drive his choices (bringing the box, staying to watch, vowing to act differently). The penitentiary context plus Marcus’s crafted heart give him individualized texture beyond a stock “guilty priest.” However, his internal conflict skews tidy—he moves relatively smoothly from regret to resolved vow without much in-the-moment contradiction or resistance. The relationship with Harrow works but remains primarily functional as a delivery system for insight rather than a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—steady curiosity channeled into unlocking the arrow tip’s secret and “ringing a bell no one hears yet”—is clear and consistent. Her profession and competence are well-integrated with the world, and her interior lens colors the descriptions. However, she faces little genuine inner conflict or hesitation; curiosity is pure drive, not a trait that creates dilemmas. The ending registers more as fulfilled vision than a choice with visible emotional cost, which limits the depth of characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive—to uncover where deleted files go—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to lie for access. We see her competence and fixation through the pattern-hunting with “2519.” However, her interior conflict around the lie and the risk to her job is only lightly sketched, mostly told rather than embodied. The final turn toward “bridge to the deleted” lands, but feels a bit declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thorne’s motivation—“map empathy onto action, lest annihilation claim all”—is clear and consistent, and her decisions directly shape the scene. However, she remains almost entirely competent and unconflicted; we see little contradictory impulse or vulnerability under pressure. The wraith and dryad each get a single, efficient emotional note (loneliness/terror) but do not move much beyond their roles. The resolution alters duties and relations, but the emotional cost to Thorne herself is barely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation (to hear the sound of endings) is vivid, particular, and consistently drives her behavior from euthanasia tourism to Arctic trawling, and her loose grip on reality plausibly feeds her risk-taking. Interiority is concrete—anchors like the parasol tip, hypothermia’s afterglow, and her frustration at “almost” hearing the sound all individualize her. Internal conflict is present but could be more sharply dramatized in peak beats (e.g., her reaction to nearly dying is mostly summarized, not tested in action). Tomas is sketched effectively but remains close to a wise-elder archetype with limited complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s emotional state and motivation are clear and embodied enough—missing the bus after a quarrel, wanting reconciliation yet feeling the pull of rural life. Theo’s role as a gentle, almost mythic confidant is coherent but borders on idealized, with few discernible flaws. Her internal shift from wounded lover to someone accepting “destined mismatch” reads earned, though it’s stated more than dramatized. The lack of real friction or resistance in her interaction with Theo keeps the characterization from feeling fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    The line walker’s motivation—preserving the prophet’s wisdom—is clear and consistently enacted, but he lacks real internal contradiction or emotional shading. His “strangely honest” nature is mostly asserted rather than tested under pressure. Interiority is thin: we rarely see fear, doubt, or desire clash with duty in the moment of consecration. As a result, his endurance at the end feels more like the completion of a task than a charged personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her role as a gentle facilitator of communal grief works, but she rarely feels conflicted or pressured—her calm is never tested. Her interiority is mostly implied through description rather than dramatized contradiction or difficult choice. The townsfolk function as a collective chorus rather than individuated characters, with only a few sketched roles (baker, seamstress). The ending offers endurance rather than visible change in her, so the emotional cost remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s reticence versus her compulsion to decode and testify is clearly motivated and culminates in the earned choice to speak, then return to silence with a cost (tears, strain, futility). Interiority is specific and embodied enough—her breath as “a ghost,” her voice cracking “like old parchment”—to feel character-particular. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened with more on-page resistance before she chooses to testify. Overall, she reads as a coherent, flawed individual rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to capture the sound of growing older as a defense against forgetfulness—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices (driftwood markers, chalk runes, using the recorder). Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with “tidal longing” and his relationship to echoes giving him a distinct emotional texture. Internal conflict is present but relatively soft; the piece gestures at contradiction (prophet who forgets, wanting permanence in decay) without dramatizing sharp in-the-moment ambivalence. The final shift from restless longing to “quiet certainty” is earned by prior setup but lands more as gentle resolution than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, age, and “luminous ache” for the ephemeral give him a clear, particular motivation that coheres with his actions, especially his almost religious care for lenses and clocks. His agency in dismantling and retuning the chronometer under pressure is well-motivated. However, his interior conflict stays relatively one-note—more yearning than truly torn—and his final “wisdom” feels a touch too tidy for the extremity of the crisis. Deeper contradiction (fear vs duty, attachment to the observatory vs acceptance of loss) would raise the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara, Harlan, and Lena are all clearly motivated, and Elara’s professional ethos shapes her actions, but they tend toward idealized archetypes rather than fully conflicted individuals. Elara’s “decisively kind” nature never meets serious resistance, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or real internal cost. Harlan’s regret and love for Lena are believable yet expressed in familiar ways, with limited idiosyncratic interiority. The relationship does change on the page (estrangement to reconciliation), but the ease of that shift keeps the emotional arc from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (obsessive drive to understand where shadows go at noon) is clear and consistent, and her actions align tightly with that goal. However, her interiority remains relatively one-note—curiosity and determination with little ambivalence or fear—so we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. Her emotional responses are mostly summarized (“Her breath caught”) rather than deeply embodied. The final stance shift (from mystery to resolved quest) feels earned but low-cost and emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s blend of clinical bone-setter pragmatism and half-ashamed longing for her grandmother’s magic is specific and consistent, and her shift from “forgiving skeptic” to cautious believer feels earned by the discovery and ritual with the tooth. Her interiority is concrete—callused fingers, professional habits—but the emotional cost of abandoning her old certainty is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. The core contradiction (skeptic who wants magic to be real) is clear, yet it never quite forces a painful trade-off beyond an internal reframing. Still, the character reads individual and motivated, with her final stance flowing logically from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to offer safe, fireless light while bound by guilt and a vow—is clear and consistent, and her history with the village fire credibly underpins it. Her interiority is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; we’re told of her clipped wings and longing more than we see those impulses collide on the page. The key turn (choosing to transform the glass and then to reveal it publicly) feels earned but largely unopposed and low-friction. The final shift from earthbound constraint to chosen purpose reads as a believable but relatively tidy evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s characterization as a “watchful dreamer” who is “quietly proactive” is coherent and drives her choices: the icicle summons and the costly act of giving up her grandmother’s pendant. Her motivation to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is clear and specific, and the way she uses the setting as emotional armor feels individual. Internal contradiction is present but muted—she’s guarded yet choosing radical exposure—but the conflict is handled more as lyric mood than dramatized push-pull. Kai is sketched effectively as a mirror-character, though he remains thematic support rather than a fully pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s core motivation (a stalled novelist torn between abandonment and completion) is clear and consistent, and his choice to keep collecting hopes and leave “whole” reads as an earned stance. However, the internal contradiction is mostly told rather than dramatized—once the ritual begins, his doubt rarely surfaces in active tension. Emotional texture leans on abstract phrasing (“conflicted novelist,” “creative surrender”) more than idiosyncratic embodiment. The result is solid but not yet piercingly particular or fully fraught on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear, rooted in her grandmother’s stories and the threat of blight, and her whimsical competence feels specific and consistent. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance, and we see little internal contradiction or doubt as she performs what is essentially a flawless ritual. The lack of on-page cost or hard choice at the climax limits the depth of her characterization. She reads as vivid but not yet fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lir’s grief-driven motive—translating Eira’s heartbeats into a map—is vivid, consistent, and rooted in specific embodied actions (hand on frozen earth, match held until it burns). His interiority comes mostly through sensory focus and ritual precision rather than abstract reflection, which feels earned and character-specific. The physical demonstrations of patience under pain deepen him beyond a single-note mourner. There’s limited explicit internal contradiction, but the tension between holding on to Eira and accepting her ascent carries through.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—and his locksmith background dovetails nicely with the harmonic lock of the timer. However, he rarely experiences contradictory impulses or visible doubt; the work is strenuous but not sharply conflicted. His interiority stays mostly conceptual and observational rather than emotionally embodied, so we don’t feel much fear of failure or cost. The closing change (leaving with a working device) feels more like completion of a task than a pressured, character-costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation and core motivation are clear and specific, and her panic vs. commitment to the “grand atlas of human loads” gives her a credible internal axis. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are only lightly dramatized; she moves from trapped to solution fairly smoothly. Emotional embodiment leans more on metaphysical imagery than on felt, character-particular sensation. The final change feels earned but the personal cost to Elara herself is more implied than viscerally registered.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is specific, embodied, and motivated: a lion tamer’s widow using craft and small magic to manage grief is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (which crystal to prioritize, to engrave Theo’s motto) all align with that. However, her interiority trends linear rather than conflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses (hoard vs. release, memory vs. pain) playing against each other in the moment. The result is emotionally persuasive but not deeply torn, which keeps the arc from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply rendered as a worn-but-still-resolute scavenger whose regret and stubbornness feel specific and earned. His motives (to reclaim wasted ambition by negotiating with his ghost) are clear and drive concrete actions. The confrontation with his younger self lands as a believable internal crucible, though a few lines (“Your scavenging hoards ghosts, not gold”) come close to thematic declaration rather than embodied feeling. Overall, change is credible and costs are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s professional mindset and motive (“puzzle out new equations for hope”) are clear and consistent, and her engineering choices track with that. What’s missing for a higher score is genuine internal conflict or visible cost—she never wavers, never missteps, and the resurrection comes without moral or emotional friction. Her emotions are mostly summarized (“wonder stoic,” “motivation burned steady”) rather than embodied in concrete, personal quirks. The endurance at the end feels earned but a little too tidy and untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s introversion, retreat into clocks, and abandoned musical dream are clear and coherent, and his decision to confront the music box grows credibly from these traits. The interiority is sensorially grounded (petrichor, physical hush) rather than abstract, though his conflict remains relatively simple—more yearning than deeply contradictory impulses. The key realization (“his solitude had been the dream's quiet evolution, not its grave”) is emotionally earned but a touch neat, with limited sense of lingering flaw or cost. Overall, the character feels particular and consistent, but not yet as layered or conflicted as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand the “architecture of lies”—is clear and consistent, and his competence in reading the canal and wreck is well grounded. However, he faces little genuine internal contradiction or emotional messiness; his realization comes smoothly rather than through visible struggle. The shift from “errant” to newly purposeful feels more told than fought for, with minimal felt cost. Strong idea of character, but the arc is low-friction for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and Kael are distinct, specific figures whose motives are clear and aligned with their occupations and histories. Elias’s patience and reverence for preservation convincingly drive his choices, and Kael’s shift from gruff suspicion to reverence is believable. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost in Elias—he never really wavers or faces a value conflict. The emotional journey is textured but relatively low in friction, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully “crucible-tested.”

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief- and ritual-driven motivation is clear and particularized (“the hollow where his sister had vanished years ago” gives his project emotional teeth). His actions—finding the thread, binding it, writing obituaries—consistently express that drive. Internal conflict is more implicit than dramatized; we don’t see him seriously resist the healing he pursues, so change feels a touch smooth. Still, the emotional progression from ache to partial integration is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elarion’s core motivation—to reawaken beauty in a deadened mechanical world—is clear and consistently embodied in his scavenging and assembly choices. His interiority is specific and textured through the “hypothesizing” habit, but his emotional range is narrow: mostly one sustained mode of fervent, melancholic wonder. Internal contradiction (hope vs dread that beauty is inherently flawed) is suggested but not really dramatized in live choices. The closing vow to “nurture its bittersweet flight” feels earned, though it costs him little beyond a reconfiguration of expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s vocation, lineage, and scars create a specific, compelling figure, and her choice to graft rather than burn coheres with her stated compassion. However, her internal conflict is more narrated than dramatized; we’re told she isn’t driven by revenge rather than feeling competing impulses in the moment. The backstory with her father and injuries is strong but could bear more in-scene friction or hesitation to reach elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s drive—to free the city’s trapped memories—is clear and consistent, and her “luminous skeptic” stance is at least gestured toward in how she questions sorcery vs coincidence. However, her skepticism and imagination are mostly asserted rather than dramatized through hard choices, and she faces little real internal conflict or cost. Her emotional life remains abstract (no specific ties to the city, no fear of failure), so the final smile feels earned structurally but not deeply on a character level.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s core motivation—“to share light without using fire”—is clear, consistent, and credibly rooted in her history with the gear and her progenitors’ failures. Her interiority is particular enough (sentimentality, ache for lineages, memory of her dam) to avoid feeling generic, and her key choice to embed the gear rather than wield it directly is well motivated. However, her emotions remain largely in abstract registers (“sentimentality swelled,” “serenity troubled her core”) with limited embodied contradiction on the page. The final endurance/renunciation is convincing but could carry more immediate, concrete cost to push into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation and long history with grief give him a clear, specific motivation that credibly drives his nights in the greenhouse and his final realization. Interiority is grounded in tactile ritual (chiseling, unrolling the ribbon) rather than abstract musing, and his shift from solitary mourner to someone “ready to trade poems anew—with the living” feels earned. However, his inner life remains fairly one-note—fiercely contemplative but with little contradiction or moral friction—and his flaws never actively complicate choices. The specters function more as guides than pressures on his psyche, so we see less of him resisting, doubting, or misstepping under that pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn: his obsessive precision, guilt over the sabotaged wedding, and long-term penance clearly motivate his climb and the ritual with the rake handle. Interiority is concrete when tied to specific acts (climbing in storms, mending the veil) and the ledger of notches is an excellent behavioral window into his ethics. The main weakness is a tendency toward abstract labels (“ethically diligent heart,” “incremental absolution”) where more in-the-moment contradiction under pressure would deepen him. His final shift from torment to peace is earned by the decades of penance but resolves a touch tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s blithe, meticulous nature is vivid and consistent, and his curiosity about the echoes motivates his actions clearly. However, he faces almost no internal conflict; his motivation “burning brighter” never forces a difficult trade-off or reveals a genuine flaw. Emotion is mostly implied via atmosphere rather than embodied contradiction or stress. The ending’s “enriched” stance feels earned but low-cost, more like mild deepening than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s core motivation—seeding innovation under the Constraint Edict—is clear and consistent, and his doubt versus determination is sketched credibly. However, his interiority remains mostly conceptual (“predictive elegance emerged”) rather than embodied, so we rarely feel his fear or risk in the body. The enforcers’ approach generates little concrete emotional dissonance beyond “heart pounding,” and we don’t see a truly conflicted micro-choice under pressure. The assertion “Prevail he did, forever” gestures at an arc but skips dramatizing the cost that would make that endurance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, defiance, and core motivation are clear and consistent, and her small on-page choices (tuning, cloaking, persisting despite risk) align with them. However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction under pressure; danger and doubt are gestured at more than dramatized. The final “change” is largely confirmation of what she already believes rather than a costly pivot. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly layered.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve fleeting emotion and guard himself from unresolved grief—is clear and consistent, and his ritual choices (drawing, burning, grinding, scattering) flow logically from it. The internal contradiction between “weaving truth carefully” and knowingly creating a mirage of safety gives him real complexity. His embodied responses (mask weight, reaction to the chair faltering) feel specific rather than generic. The arc from controlled ritualist to unmasked doubter at the end reads earned rather than epiphanic shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve rational chronometry against encroaching myth—is clear, specific, and drives his choices from wall-scratching to excavation to reconstruction. His internal conflict (certainty vs. doubt sparked by the cog and the cult’s story) is well-rendered, though “agonizing” is leaned on as a label more than once instead of deepening into new shades of contradiction. Bodily and sensory detail (“silt caking his beard,” cog pulsing like a second pulse) grounds his emotion effectively. The lack of an on-page foil character keeps relationship pressure abstract, so his final resolution carries more intellectual than visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve vanishing arts by braiding damaged people into harmony—is clear and consistent, and the ex-militiaman, merchant, and scholar are sketched with distinct past harms. However, interior conflict remains abstract; we’re told hatred softens but rarely feel concrete, contradictory impulses in the moment. The time-lapse “weeks blurring into months” summarizes the hard work instead of dramatizing micro-choices under pressure, which flattens the emotional arc. The final harmony feels earned conceptually more than psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and memorable—chef, gentle rebel, informal sage—and his motivation to turn ruin into quiet resistance is clear and consistent. Interiority is filtered through his sensory attention to flavors and memories, which feels character-true. However, he experiences relatively little on-page doubt or contradictory impulse; his rebellion never really costs him anything in the moment. The final choice to plant and leave reads inevitable rather than hard-won, which caps the depth of his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his curse, weariness, and desire to preserve wonder all align with his central choice to use the riddle-box. Mira is less deep but still specific and competent, with her jaded technician stance and quick grasp of the hive’s biology. Internal contradiction (his hatred of bluntness vs commitment to wonder) is present but lightly dramatized rather than really tested. The ending endurance—he keeps working the booth, paying the cost of his curse while bending it—is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motivation (to understand why some houses are “alive”) is clear and consistent, and his noticing habit feels specific rather than generic. However, he faces little genuine resistance or conflicted impulse; his evolution from noticer to “quietude’s keeper” is smooth and largely unopposed. Emotional response is more described at a conceptual level than embodied in concrete, idiosyncratic reactions. The final shift feels earned but low-cost, limiting depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s rage, shame, and eventual reorientation toward nuance are clear, embodied, and motivated by the revelation about her ancestor; her progression from “certainty as anchor” to revaluation feels earned. Internal conflict is present (fierce condemnation vs. unwillingness to relinquish it) but could be sharpened with more character-specific detail beyond lineage shame. Thalor reads as a distinct presence whose “incisive kindness” guides events, though at times it edges toward didactic function. The final touch of her hand to its mossy palm lands as a credible behavioral echo of her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grim optimism, balanced daring, and fixation on the “texture of missed opportunities” give him a clear, particular interiority, especially in the way he uses the dice to guide proofs. His motivation is coherent and continuous, and his acceptance at the end reads as Earned Stasis, not apathy. Internal conflict (hope vs. acceptance of futility) is present but stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied in more varied, concrete reactions. The piece could gain depth by showing more irrational swings or bodily stress as his proof nears rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s inner life is specific and coherent: the mix of exhaustion, doubt, and “methodically hopeful” persistence feels particular rather than generic. His choices—setting up the inks, invoking the glyphs, expanding to the windowpanes—track clearly to his core motivation. The shift from gnawing doubt to a hard-earned, drowsy certainty is believable and emotionally legible, though internal contradiction under peak pressure could be sharpened further. Secondary figures function more as echoes than characters, but that suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives (preserving arts, guiding refugees, rallying them in crisis) are clear, consistent, and drive her choices, especially when she pivots from tour guide to evacuation leader. Interiority is vivid but skewed toward descriptive perception rather than contradictory impulses, so internal conflict feels muted. The refugees function mostly as a collective chorus rather than individuated pressures, but their skills and fears do shape context. Her final decision to abandon the grotto for the opera house is motivated and carries implied cost, though that cost could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s core drive—to defy his cursed fate even at personal cost—is clear and consistent, and his “neatly inventive” nature is well-embodied in how he handles the yoyo and clocks. The emotional palette (fear, hunger for change, bleak exhilaration) comes through, but it leans more declarative than deeply conflicted; we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull beyond “this will kill me, I’ll do it anyway.” His choices at the end feel earned by what’s been established, and the cost is legible. However, interior contradiction and lived specificity (habits, petty fears, irrational reluctances) are thinner than they would be at an elite literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to escape limbo by tricking Fear—is clear and consistent, and her suicidal backstory adds a sharp, character-specific engine to her choices. The shame of having “failed” at dying gives her a credible, bitter edge that fits the horror frame. Internal contradiction (wanting oblivion vs fighting to survive) is implied but not deeply dramatized moment to moment; she mostly moves straightforwardly through the ritual once the plan is given. The advisor as secondary pressure is effective but reads more as plot guide than as a crucible for Elara’s blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motivation (“to turn obstacles into instruments”) is clear and enacted in concrete choices: lashing debris into a xylophone, using waves and wreckage as keys. Interiority is mostly carried through sensory perception and action rather than abstract labels, which keeps him specific and embodied. Internal contradiction exists but is lightly sketched—the mix of fierce joy and anxiety under pressure could be pushed further for full complexity. The ending gives a modest but credible arc: he’s sated yet still restless, an Earned Stasis that fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s obsession, professional competence, and refusal to heed the council are clear and consistent, and her choice to sound the whistle underpins the entire catastrophe. However, internal contradiction is thin: she almost never wavers or experiences competing impulses, so her “quietly driven” nature doesn’t quite deepen into a complex inner conflict. Emotional response is mostly handled via atmosphere (“sunwashed dread,” sweat, humming shell) rather than layered interiority. The final cost—having likely doomed the city—lands conceptually but we get little textured, character-particular reaction to that knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motivation and professional lens are clear, and the “emotionally rational” trait is embodied in moments like his silent weeping while cataloging evidence. However, his internal conflict is relatively muted; he rarely feels genuinely torn between exposing the truth and honoring the “noble lies.” The grandfather connection is strong but under-exploited as a live dilemma rather than a retrospective fact. He finishes largely as he began, with deepened conviction but limited visible cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his methodical, self-imposed task under physical duress gives him some lived specificity. However, the interiority leans heavily on repeated labels and thematic language (“stoically sensitive,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) rather than showing sustained contradictory impulses in action. His risk to life and limb is there, but his choice to endure feels more like an enactment of a thesis than a messy, character-particular struggle. The final endurance/renunciation beat lands, but with relatively low emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to uncover Elyria’s true downfall—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her logical-yet-flexible mindset is well sketched (“abandon strict logic for an alternative hypothesis”). However, her internal conflict is more labeled than dramatized; “dappled resolve” and “tranquilly perceptive” recur as concepts without many concrete moments where contradictory impulses visibly collide. The shift from dutiful indexer to self-appointed guardian of the library’s truth is a credible change, though its emotional cost remains mostly conceptual. More embodied doubt or fear, especially on approaching or entering the vault, would lift this toward elite.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elar’s grief, craftiness, and fixation on Lira are specific and consistently dramatized through his choices (lantern-making, gem selection, ascent to the basilica). The internal paradox “unburdened yet heavier” gives him dimensionality, and his final act of folding cranes feels earned by prior setup. Emotional experience is mostly embodied via images rather than labels. The only shortfall is that conflicting impulses under peak pressure could be pushed a bit harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is strong and specific—trauma from the drone-strike wedding clearly fuels her obsession with harvesting “unused potential.” The wedding flashback and scar imagery give her an embodied, particular interiority rather than a generic tragic backstory. However, her internal conflict in the present is relatively light; the exhilaration largely outweighs any on-page hesitation or moral friction. The closing shift to “sovereign of the unseen” feels earned but could land harder with one sharper, cost-tinged contradiction in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly motivated (bored guardian longing for meaning/belonging) and her choices drive the story, with her skepticism and ache making her eventual belief feel earned. The pilgrim is more emblematic than fully human, but his “perpetually surprised” affect does interact meaningfully with the theme. Emotional states are sometimes told in abstract terms (“Her own life felt like missing pieces”) rather than embodied, which flattens some complexity. Still, the relationship dynamic—her sharp competence vs. his fragile faith—creates a credible small arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s guilt, history with his mother, and complicity in Mira’s deception are clear and driving, and his final resolve to change his practice reads earned. The profession-specific interiority (black market genealogist, document forger) gives him particularity. Internal conflict is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses within single moments. The emotional palette leans on a few abstractions (“guilt,” “regret”) instead of consistently embodied, scene-specific feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guilt over the counterfeit pull and her drive to redeem that mistake give her clear, consistent motivation that credibly informs her decision to confess and hand over the talisman. However, her internal conflict is underplayed in the live moment—the scene rarely shows her tempted to hedge or retreat, so her shift toward self-forgiveness feels somewhat pre-decided. Kael has a legible loss history and a recognizable reluctance, but he remains sketched rather than fully dimensional. The sibling relationship (with Tomas) is present but minimally leveraged as a crucible beyond basic concern.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias feels vivid and particular: the fallen navigator whose mix of competence, self-loathing, and stubborn humor drives every beat. His motivation (seeking a new "true north") is clear and consistent, and the merrily-melancholic tone of his reactions under pressure feels earned rather than pasted on. Internal conflict between self-punishment and hope is present, though often summarized via regret lists instead of dramatized through specific remembered scenes. The final stance shift toward "Heart leads; follow" is believable, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jax’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—atonement via rekindling Elara’s empathy—and his past crime history plus neural wipe give him a textured contradiction. His micro-choices (hoarding the papers, undertaking the journey, insisting on the baseball’s meaning) all align with that drive. Elara, however, is more a function than a fully realized person; her shift from void to tear feels emotionally underdeveloped and fast. The final “quiet victory” lands, but with less felt cost than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive—to reforge her bond with Thorne beyond death—is clear and consistent, and the reluctance about losing her humanity is at least stated. However, the internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices, and her acceptance of metamorphosis comes very quickly once the rite begins. The emotional cost of shedding her human life is underplayed, softening what should be a wrenching decision. Thorne, as a spectral wolf, functions more as a reward than as an active relational pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirien’s motive—to atone for years of stolen time and reorient her relationship to her child—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized. Interiority is vivid and embodied (blood loss, trembling, the baby nursing), with the cartomancy and family ritual revealing character under pressure. The internal conflict between surrendering control and interrogating fate is present but could sharpen into more concrete, contradictory impulses in the peak beats. Her closing shift toward “promise rather than a curse” feels earned by prior choices rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s pacifism versus buried rage, guilt, and envy gives her a real, felt contradiction, and her choice to integrate rather than expel the shadows is clearly motivated by that creed. Her emotional experience is mostly dramatized through images (the tapestry, the stitching) rather than labels, though “shadow work” and “integration” edge toward therapeutic abstraction. The cost of her change is emotional and effortful rather than morally fraught, but it still reads as a credible evolution. Overall she feels specific and coherent, but not yet at a level of granularity or messiness that would be truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is specific and memorable—a “destitute philanthropist” whose actions (giving away coin, herbs, orchestrating notes) are consistent with his nature and drive the scene. His yearning “to understand the texture of transformation” gives him a clear inner motive. However, he lacks on-page contradictory impulses or real hesitation; the arc from giver to “guide” is mostly asserted rather than dramatized through a pressured choice. Secondary characters are emotive symbols rather than active pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s vocation and revolutionary motivation are clear and consistent, and her competence with locks and codes is well dramatized in the sundial and vault beats. However, she experiences almost no internal conflict or visible fear, which flattens her under pressure; she is largely a steady emblem of purpose. The brief interaction with Mira hints at relationships but doesn’t add much pressure or cost. The ending “sentinel eternal” formulation reinforces her archetype status rather than a felt change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s core motivation—honoring his wife’s last request by decoding the sacred patterns—is clear and coherently drives his actions. The precognitive curse is dramatized as torment, but his internal conflict (fear of failure vs compulsion to try) is more implied than embodied in specific, contradictory impulses on the page. His transformation from “cursed” to “blessing” at the end is emotionally plausible but arrives a bit as a clean epiphany rather than a hard-won, messy choice. The relationship with his wife is thematically strong but remains mostly conceptual, limiting the relational crucible’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific: the scars, censorship, and betrayal give him a textured psyche rather than a stock “oppressed artist.” His contradictory impulses—rage at censorship vs. “furious tranquility” and awe—are dramatized in how he engages the storm and the anonymous poem. The final shift from solitary, almost martyr-like vigil to recognizing the cartography of scars as communal feels earned. The main limitation is that his change involves relatively low on-page cost in this scene, more reframing than wrenching renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and ethos (“to turn questions into destinations”) are clear and embodied in his actions, and Lang’s opposing philosophy gives their rivalry texture. However, Elias experiences little visible internal conflict when the hidden overture appears—he pivots from rivalry to alliance with minimal hesitation or emotional friction. The mechanical arm adds character specificity through action in the duel but doesn’t expose deeper vulnerability. Relationship dynamics do shift credibly from antagonism to wary alliance, but the cost of that shift is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is vivid and particular—a “vagrant penny poet” whose mix of theatrical self-reinvention and genuine conviction feels alive—and Mira has a clear, flinty presence, though with less depth. Motivation (forge beauty, rebuild, resist) is consistent and drives action, but internal contradiction is more stated (molting personas) than dramatized through hard choices. Their relationship forms organically through labor and talk, yet it’s never truly pressured or forced into a costly decision. The late note about Elias molting into a “sly organizer” gestures at an arc but doesn’t fully test or complicate it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s longing and tactical mind are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized through choices like decoding the reel and venturing into the arbor. However, his interiority leans toward a single-note blend of “wistful” and “resolute,” with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The reunion is mostly conceptual (illusion/voice) and doesn’t force him into a difficult tradeoff or moral cost. The final shift to “hidden maestro” is earned but a bit tidy given the emotional complexity of grief and fate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to protect collective memory as it frays—is clear, specific, and consistent, and her role as “reality checker” gives her a distinct professional psychology. Her doubt vs. duty tension is present but mostly articulated rather than put under sharp on-page pressure; she rarely has to choose between conflicting goods. Interiority is textured (the empiricist in a whimsical world), but her emotional progression from doubt to renewed vigilance feels somewhat linear and unsurprising. The final stance of “endless vigilance fueled by doubt” is credible but could carry more visible cost or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and emotional state are clear and consistent, with concrete symbolic actions (pruning “regrets,” using the compass) that align with her need to process Tomas. However, her internal conflict is smoothed over—she accepts Hiroshi’s guidance with little resistance, and the shift from grief to acceptance feels slightly too tidy for the depth of loss implied. Hiroshi is effective as a calm, slow-spoken mentor, but he stays in a familiar wise-elder register without much individual quirk beyond diction. The final acceptance—“cerulean regret transformed”—is earned but not deeply troubled by contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is handled through static labels rather than dramatized desire. The protagonist's actions—tearing wings off dozens of living butterflies—create a jarring disconnect with the intended tone of "kindled humility," painting her as unintentionally cruel rather than observant. There is no internal struggle; she simply enacts the prompt's instructions without human friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "steadily adaptive" rather than demonstrating the trait through organic struggle. The motivation ("to discover purpose in those pauses") feels abstract and stated rather than viscerally felt, leading to a functional rather than human protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.9)
    Elara functions as a competent technician of emotion rather than a complex character; her motivation is stated explicitly but lacks internal friction or doubt. The "silently expressive" attribute is applied as a label rather than dramatized through specific, difficult constraints on communication or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("weary," "stubborn") rather than organic behavior. The prompt attribute "inadvertently stubborn" is inserted verbatim twice as a mechanical tag to force the plot, rather than functioning as an integrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characters function as archetypes within a fable-like summary rather than individuals navigating a specific crisis. Mira’s motivation is explicitly stated in narration and dialogue ("ensure the exiles' spirit endured") rather than revealed through a high-pressure choice with visible cost. There is no dramatized internal conflict; resistance is overcome in broad strokes ("Mira persisted"), leaving the protagonist's agency largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "pilgrim of sparks") rather than embodied traits or difficult choices. The repeated use of the phrase "spiritually curious" to tag thoughts and dialogue (e.g., "whispered, spiritually curious as ever") replaces genuine interiority with authorial assertion. Mira functions as a prop for the protagonist's ability rather than a character with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies on abstract labels ("quaking reverie") and melodramatic physical cues ("shrieked," "trembled") rather than grounded, embodied emotion. The character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is defined by the repetitive label "patiently strategic" rather than embodied traits or distinct interiority. Her escape relies on a convenient pre-set trap ("chains looped cleverly") rather than a character-driven choice under pressure, and her "internal conflict" is replaced by didactic statements of motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s synesthesia and scar tissue provide a distinct, embodied interiority that colors his worldview. His motivation is clear and intensifies effectively when he realizes he must sacrifice his own memory ("core absence") rather than rely on scavenged materials. The "mitosis" constraint, while functional, feels slightly like an imposed magic-system rule rather than organic character logic, but the emotional arc is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    The character is defined primarily by labels ("quietly savvy") rather than demonstrated traits. Her internal state transitions instantly from thief to mystic without sufficient friction or earned development. The repeated use of the prompt attribute as a direct tag flattens the characterization into a functional placeholder.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on direct labeling ("contemplative," "thoughtfully spirited") rather than demonstrated behavior. The dialogue is theatrically overwrought ("Lo, the heart of earth yields its molten soul"), preventing any grounding in genuine human psychology or reaction. The protagonist feels like a vehicle for prompt words rather than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.3)
    Characterization relies on resume-style summary and explicit labels ("stunt double," "firmly adaptive") rather than dramatized choice. The inclusion of meta-commentary preventing any immersion in the character's interiority or genuine emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repetitive application of the label "mildly obsessed" rather than dramatizing the trait through costly action. The protagonist's internal life is flattened into a prompt-fulfillment vehicle, and the interaction with Elara lacks genuine relational pressure or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the prompt rather than a character with embodied agency. The trait "remarkably composed" is inserted four times as a static label rather than a constraint that shapes choices. Motivation is explicitly stated ("burned steady") but lacks dramatized urgency or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labeling ("mistrust etched in the furrow," "guarded heart") rather than dramatized behavior. Mira’s transformation from deep grief to "thawed" transparency occurs instantly upon viewing a doodle, lacking psychological realism or earned struggle. The protagonist’s motivation is stated ("to thaw that mistrust") but operates through a magical mechanism rather than interpersonal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a compelling, agentic protagonist whose "wisely pragmatic" worldview drives the plot and earns the resolution. His refusal to accept the "stone fate" of the scanners creates a distinct internal and external conflict that is resolved through character-specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated ("prove that time moved sideways"), but her interiority remains abstract and distant. The characterization relies on repeated labels ("obliging," "mechanically warm") rather than embodied emotion or complex choice. The meta-fictional breakdown at the end severs the reader's connection to her character arc, reducing her to a text function.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias acts as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a fully realized character; his motivation ("feverish dreams") is external and abstract. The connection to Elara is stated through exposition ("ghost in stories") rather than dramatized, making his emotional investment in the dangerous climax feel unearned. The "lately inspired" trait operates as a repeated label rather than a driver of specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal landscape is distinct, though the "fault-tolerant" trait initially reads as conceptual before grounding in the final realization. The transition from abstract unease to specific grief over the cartographer provides a necessary emotional anchor, although the cartographer's role relies heavily on retrospective motivation rather than present-tense interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.7)
    Jax's motivation is clearly stated ("weight of a swallowed truth"), but his skepticism dissolves too conveniently to serve the plot's psychic twist. The emotional climax relies on diagnostic summary ("feather-light revelation") rather than dramatized reaction, and the "religiously skeptical" trait feels like an attached label that vanishes when pressure is applied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an abstract entity lacking internal contradiction or distinct personality traits beyond the prompt's requirements. Choices face no resistance; the decision to leave is immediate and unconflicted ("recognized its call immediately"), and the "cost" of the transition is purely metaphorical ("compressing reality's edges") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("mellow," "softly adaptive") rather than demonstrated behavior. Lila serves as a passive prop for Elias's healing, offering no genuine resistance or friction to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.0)
    Motivation is asserted via metaphor ("burned like embers") rather than dramatized through conflict or difficult tradeoffs. Thorne functions primarily as a passive receiver of backstory; his "oddness" is a repeated label rather than a complex trait revealed through distinct, high-pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is stated via labels ("crystallized," "yearned") rather than dramatized through struggle or internal resistance. Elias transforms instantly from a bored writer to a lethal tactician without a credible bridge for this capability gap. The internal arc lacks the friction or cost required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is a functional avatar for the concept rather than a living character; he lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or a distinct personality beyond his title. His motivation is stated abstractly ("burning clear") rather than embodied in difficult choices, and he navigates the crisis without emotional cost or personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is defined by repeated labels ("cryptic," "chronologically homesick") rather than specific behavior or internal conflict. She lacks contradictory impulses; her desire meets no internal resistance or doubt, leading to a frictionless, linear progression of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elias functions as a vehicle for the prompt rather than a realized character; his "burning motivation" is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through distinct behavior. The internal conflict is externalized into a literal minotaur/shadow fight, bypassing the need for genuine psychological interiority or difficult micro-choices. The resolution—integrating the shadow—feels like a mechanical power-up rather than a hard-won emotional synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's internal conflict is labeled ("emotional numbness") rather than dramatized through complex behavior; the resolution is achieved via a magical object rather than a costly personal choice. The rapid transition from numbness to connection skips the necessary struggle, leaving the emotional arc feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a consistent, competent archetype, but her interiority relies heavily on "data-logic" clichés ("panic served no data point") that distance the reader from genuine emotional cost. Her decision to stay feels intellectually derived rather than viscerally earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is clear but executed through melodramatic introspection ("tears that carved rivers") rather than subtext. The emotional arc feels performative, relying on stock grief tropes rather than specific, earned interiority. The transition from cautious broker to weeping widower happens via assertion rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the repetitive application of the label "ethically playful," which appears five times rather than being demonstrated through organic, distinct action. While there is a clear internal desire, the reliance on inserted prompt phrases to define his nature flattens his interiority and makes his behavior feel prescriptive rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lir functions well as a mythic vessel for the theme, but his internal struggle ("fearing its incompleteness") is resolved with relatively low resistance during the climax. The emotional risk of sharing his father's story is stated rather than deeply felt through hesitation or contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a functional archetype who executes his role with competence, but his internal landscape feels static. While he demonstrates agency in the calibration beats, the repetition of his defining trait ("professionally thorough") four times reduces him to a label rather than a complex character. The "pang of detachment" offers a glimpse of cost, but it is quickly subsumed without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.4)
    Character reactions are bizarrely understated; Elias "chuckles softly" upon finding a photo of his dead sister, treating a tragic artifact as a whimsical clue. Traits are asserted via repeated adverbs ("shrewdly," "whimsically") rather than demonstrated through complex choice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    Character motivation is declared via labels ("glowing yearning") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. The protagonist faces no internal contradictions; her desire for connection is met with immediate, conflict-free acceptance by the group. The trait "boldly sympathetic" is inserted as a static adjective phrase rather than demonstrated through action with cost. Emotional states are abstract summaries rather than embodied experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is a competent, functional protagonist whose drive moves the plot, but she lacks internal friction or a distinct emotional arc. Her success relies on a pre-existing tool rather than a difficult personal choice or adaptation, making her victory feel inevitable rather than earned through vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thorne is distinct, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "grief's indeterminate ache," "ambiguous loss had fractured him") rather than embodied feeling. While the motivation is clear, the emotional progression feels abstract and theoretical, filtered through the prompt's required terminology rather than lived experience. The "mathematics of emotion" concept intellectualizes his struggle, creating a distance that prevents visceral connection during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and poignantly inverted—seeking visibility through hiding—and the arc resolves with a decisive character beat. However, his agency is undercut by the climax, where his defining action relies on a serendipitous discovery rather than his established skills or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear (obsession with plant behavior), but the protagonist's internal struggle is summarized rather than dramatized. The "reluctance" is stated repeatedly as a label but is not felt in the decision-making process, as he brews and drinks the transforming tea with minimal hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("wryly earnest," "haggard") rather than embodied interiority. Elias’s emotional state is asserted through adjectives instead of demonstrated through distinct thought or contradictory impulse. The interaction with Mira feels functional and lacks status dynamics or genuine friction; they mirror each other too perfectly to generate character-revealing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.7)
    Character motivations are largely asserted rather than felt; Thorne's desire is stated in prompt-speak ("yearning to magnify the everyday magic"), and he remains a passive observer during the climax. Elara's transition from resistance to acceptance ("With a resolute breath") is abrupt and unearned by prior emotional groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a vehicle for prompt adherence rather than a living character; his trait "reactively visionary" is applied as a static label rather than a dramatized flaw or gift. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; his motivation "burned steady" without wavering, leading to a frictionless emotional arc that feels performed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by labels ("analytically artistic," "meticulous") rather than dramatized complexity. His internal conflict ("bad habits—doubt") is resolved instantly by the setting's momentum rather than a difficult choice. Emotional states are told via adjectives ("trembling certainty") rather than embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "courageously kind" rather than demonstrated action or internal texture. The protagonist's skepticism serves as a nominal starting point but dissolves instantly upon contact with the magic object, lacking genuine internal resistance or cost. Emotional beats are summarized with abstract nouns ("sympathy stirred," "hollow with loss") rather than embodied in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elowen functions as a standard "bored immortal" archetype without distinct personality traits or internal contradiction. His motivation is singular and meets no emotional resistance or doubt; he desires an end to ennui and pursues it linearly, lacking the "contradictory impulses acting in scene" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's defining internal conflict—honesty versus con artistry—is resolved chemically by the magical ink ("vapor... liquefying his rigid adherence to scruple") rather than through a conscious, earned choice. This removes agency at the pivotal moment, making the character a vessel for the prop's effects rather than an active driver of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    Thorne’s arc from escapist invention to bearing witness is legible, but his interiority is often obscured by the prose’s ornamentation. The transition feels driven more by the magical device (the lamp’s shift) than deep internal struggle, though the final choice to bind the "fractured truth" lands the character beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist functions as a concept avatar rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict. Their motivation is stated via exposition ("Driven by a profound motivation") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. The character faces no moral or tactical dilemma; they simply accumulate data until the plot resolves their identity crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear objective, but his characterization relies heavily on the repeated label of "gloomy cheerfulness" rather than embodied emotion. His internal state is summarized through backstory ("shattered a hundred such tales") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment. While his competence is established, the emotional journey feels somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("orderly intuitive nature," "dual allegiance") rather than dramatized behavior. Internal conflict is summarized ("tore at her") but does not manifest in difficult on-page choices or hesitation. The protagonist's "shock absorber" role functions more as backstory exposition than an active, constrained skill in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is legible, but the attribute "purposefully curious" acts as a told label rather than a driver of complex choice. Emotional interiority feels performed through adjectives ("forgotten dreams") rather than embodied reaction, and the protagonist lacks a defining moment of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine flaws, with his blindness treated as a magical advantage ("unerring intuition") rather than a constraint with cost. Emotions are applied as labels ("heartfelt passion," "serene") rather than dramatized through distinct interiority or difficult choices. The character remains static, executing a complex task with "flawless" competence that removes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("dry wit," "subtly confident") rather than dramatized behavior. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Harlan moves from confidence to confirmation without struggle or cost. The soliloquies feel performative rather than revealing genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.3)
    Elias is a flat archetype defined solely by the repeated labels "cryptic" and "infinitely patient" rather than by specific behavior or internal contradiction. He faces no difficult choices, possesses no distinct voice, and undergoes no change or cost, functioning as a plot device rather than a character. The lack of internal or external resistance leaves him devoid of agency or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    Motivation relies on generic tropes ("ancestors," "inheritance") rather than specific character necessity. Internal conflict is labeled ("primal instinct") but resolved via a magical item that artificially calms the protagonist, bypassing genuine emotional struggle or grit.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has a clear motivation to redeem his father's legacy, but his interiority relies on abstract summaries ("chased hush") rather than embodied emotion. The vendetta is stated as a fact rather than felt through visceral reactions to the danger or the bodies, creating a distance between the character's intent and the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a passive figure who accepts his fate without resistance or significant micro-choice, reducing him to an archetype rather than a character. The narrative reliance on summary ("days blurred," "lifetimes entwined") prevents the dramatization of contradictory impulses or genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as an archetype rather than a character, defined by high-concept labels ("poetic wharf weaver") rather than internal depth. Her pivotal moment involves surrendering agency to a "rhythmic trance of sleepwalking," meaning the climax is performed by magic/instinct rather than a conscious, difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.6)
    Character motivation is conveyed almost entirely through diagnostic labels ("yearned to restore," "faith had faded") rather than dramatized struggle. The internal state lacks contradiction or complexity; Elara is a static vessel for the prompt's requirements, moving from "lost" to "found" without a visible psychological cost or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and explicit labeling of traits ("She was carefully inventive," "Her motivation pulsed deep") rather than dramatizing them through friction. The backstory about the uncle feels inserted to satisfy a requirement rather than arising organically from the moment's pressure. Emotion is described ("defiant joy," "poignant ache") rather than embodied in specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype ("wise fool") rather than a layered character; her internal state lacks conflict, as she knows exactly what to do without hesitation. The "foolishness" is performed for the courier without personal cost or risk of failure, resulting in a low-stakes interaction. While her competence is established, the absence of doubt or meaningful trade-offs limits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the prompt rather than a grounded character; her "fierce tenderness" is a repeated label rather than an embodied emotion. Her motivation is abstract, and her primary action is a magical procedure that lacks a difficult, character-defining choice. Thorne is a passive prize pulled from limbo, lacking agency or distinct personality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by repeated labels ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted") rather than active choices or contradictory impulses. Her interaction with the passive, anesthetized boy prevents any genuine relational pressure or status dynamics from emerging. The emotional connection feels assumed rather than earned through specific, embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    Emotional states are labeled ("pensive mirth," "delight") rather than embodied in action, resulting in a performance of feeling rather than genuine interiority. The protagonist faces no internal resistance or contradictory impulses, making the character arc a frictionless procession of success.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated rather than shown through struggle. The antagonist, Lena, converts from "ironclad certainty" to apprenticeship instantly upon seeing the magic, lacking credible psychological resistance or "relationships as crucible." Mid-scene head-hopping into Lena’s childhood memories disrupts the POV consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjectival labels ("charming rogue," "disarming grin") rather than dramatized choice or internal conflict. Elias faces no genuine dilemma or temptation; his "spark" is a stated premise rather than a felt vulnerability. The lack of internal contradiction or cost makes him read as a generic archetype rather than a specific individual.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined entirely by labels and the prompt's required attributes rather than embodied traits. Motivation is stated ("longing," "hunger") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or internal conflict. The descriptor "shyly unstoppable" is applied repeatedly as a fixed epithet rather than emerging from behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's requirements rather than a living character. Her interiority is stylized through heavy adjectival labeling ("toxic bloom of remorse") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse. While her motivation is clear, her reactions are dictated by the ritualistic structure rather than genuine psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "carefully reckless" rather than demonstrated complexity in decision-making. The relationship conflict is resolved via a magical "win button" that forces Thorne to see the truth, denying him agency and bypassing the need for an earned, messy emotional confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias relies on the convenient discovery of an ancestral letter rather than personal agency to resolve the central dilemma, reducing him to a vessel for the plot. His emotional state is signaled through the repetitive somatic tic of "trembling" (used four times) rather than conflicting choices, and the "feasting" conclusion bypasses the necessary struggle of persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on summary and labeled interiority ("turmoil," "trust") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's arc is told through a synopsis of emotional states over months and years, preventing any singular moment of psychological depth or contradictory impulse from landing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elowen functions primarily as a lyrical vehicle rather than a grounded character; her interiority is conveyed through abstract labels ("core ache") rather than embodied emotion. The repetition of the prompt phrase "featherly determined" acts as a tell-tag rather than a demonstrated trait. Her agency is undermined by the reliance on "intuiting" solutions rather than struggling through them.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "reclusive" engineer offers no resistance, dissolving the potential for relational conflict or status dynamics immediately. The recurring tag "softly ingenious" acts as a label rather than a demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character is defined by oxymoronic labels ("merry dirge," "cheerful gloom") rather than embodied emotion or complex interiority. Elara is passive; she waits for the bird to solve the central mystery rather than driving the plot through active struggle or high-stakes choices. The "recollectionist" role feels like a costume for the theme rather than a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    Jasper acts as a plot device rather than a distinct character; his "analytical" nature is asserted but his actions (controlling wind-tossed objects) read as superpower rather than skill. The arrival of the "lanky man" is a convenient contrivance that resolves the scene without earned emotional labor or genuine interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara’s motivation shifts abruptly from cherishing isolation to desperate longing without sufficient dramatic pressure to earn the pivot. Kai serves as a passive recipient rather than an agent, and the internal struggle is resolved through abstract realization rather than character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("motivation burned steady—to reveal how...") rather than dramatized through choice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("noctilucent reckonings") and diagnostic self-awareness rather than embodied emotion. The character functions as a vessel for the prompt elements without genuine internal conflict or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.6)
    Character motivation feels abstract and authorial ("to translate his pain") rather than embodied. Dialogue is highly unnatural and breaks verisimilitude, specifically when Elias explicitly articulates prompt requirements ("To enlighten you, child, I must reflect deeply...").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    Motivation is entirely abstract ("puzzle out new equations") with no grounded personal stakes or potential for loss. The character is defined by repeated labels ("logical dreamer") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict and motivation are clear, driving the narrative toward a distinct choice. However, the mechanical insertion of the prompt phrase "sensitively perceptive" (three times) acts as a label rather than embodied behavior, flattening the characterization in those moments. The "echo cartographer" identity is established well, but the emotional reaction to the "legacy's burden" feels slightly melodramatic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.3)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined by labels ("grace," "calm") rather than interiority or struggle. Her motivation to "borrow heartbeats" raises ethical questions the story ignores, treating the act as a harmless ritual. There is no internal conflict; she performs her function mechanically without doubt or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is defined by repetitive labels rather than organic complexity; her "operatively gentle" nature is asserted rather than dramatized through nuance. Her internal conflict is summarized in exposition, and her sway over the warlords lacks earned psychological authority or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's duality is stated ("Philanthropy was his mask") rather than dramatized through pressure; we see the sentimental boy but the "titan" is only backstory. The shift from ruthless despoiler to weeping pilgrim relies on the "secretly sentimental" trope without sufficient on-page struggle to earn the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elara functions as a symbolic archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, distinct voice, or active struggle. Her motivation is delivered via abstract summary ("silent vow") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("uncommonly serene") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's internal transformation feels unearned, resolving deep artistic conflict with a sudden, frictionless shift in mindset without genuine on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("motivation burned softly") rather than dramatized through struggle. She faces no internal conflict, and her immediate acceptance of the wind's destruction removes the potential for a difficult, defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara is competent, but her emotional arc is largely summarized rather than dramatized. By stating she "forgave herself" in the opening sentence, the story removes the potential for internal conflict or an on-page realization, leaving her character state static and the resulting emotion performed rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the prompt rather than a realized character; her "motivation" is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through friction or contradiction. The internal change—transcendence—is instantaneous and lacks a visible hierarchy of values or emotional cost, resolving without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the trait of "frugality" operates as a repetitive label rather than a source of complex interiority or costly choice. There is no internal conflict; Ezar moves from observation to success without doubt or struggle. The emotional landscape is summarized ("hoarding the moment's thrill") rather than embodied in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on functional labels ("scheming pacifist," "battle-hardened") rather than dramatized complexity. Elias lacks internal conflict or risk, acting as a static device to facilitate the theme, while Thorne acts as a vessel for resentment without agency until the magical resolution. The interaction lacks genuine status dynamics or interpersonal pressure, as the "conversation" is entirely mediated by the music box.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is clearly defined by his grief and trade, but his "firmly grounded" trait feels like a label rather than a true constraint. He abandons this skepticism instantly to perform the ritual, bypassing the potential internal conflict between reality and illusion without a struggle on the page. Motivation is strong, but the emotional arc lacks the friction of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lila is defined by the repetitive label "endearingly feisty" rather than specific, contradictory actions or choices. Her rapid transition from mocking the vows to actively participating in the ritual lacks psychological causality or earned emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("bewildered," "disquiet") rather than embodied emotion or behavior. Elara's motivation is stated as "forbidden knowledge" but lacks internal conflict or personal stakes beyond the prompt's directive. Her transition from curator to "weaver of loops" feels like a functional role shift rather than an earned character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on the repetitive epithet "carefully resourceful" rather than organic behavior. Elara and the traveler function as plot devices in a summary-style narrative, lacking distinct interiority or struggle. The emotional connection to the "unlearned lessons" is stated but never felt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is defined by her role as "discoverer" and abstract labels rather than distinct personality or contradictory impulses. Her internal state is asserted via repeated prompt phrases (e.g., "unkindled solace") rather than dramatized through specific reactions or somatic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("adaptable," "warmly methodical") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Elara exhibits no internal conflict or genuine struggle; her "adaptability" manifests as convenient procedural compliance rather than agency, and the meta-ending detaches the character from the narrative reality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a character, performing a role without internal conflict or doubt. Her "motivation" is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and her competence is absolute, removing the possibility of meaningful failure. The repeated phrase "hammered repose" substitutes for genuine emotional interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated, but her interiority relies on high-flown descriptors ("cursed and gifted," "thistle-blown hope") rather than grounded psychological specificity. There is no genuine internal conflict; her doubt is introduced but immediately resolved by the magical efficacy of the shard and visions, leaving her without a difficult choice or a felt cost to pay.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for prompt keywords than a living character; traits are applied via repetitive labels ("preemptively nostalgic" appears six times) rather than enacted behavior. Interiority consists of abstract diagnostic statements about "sculpting identity" rather than embodied emotion or genuine struggle. While the motivation is clear, it remains intellectual and distant, lacking the visceral contradiction required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions as a cipher for the premise rather than a living character; his motivation is abstract ("defy the gravity of hopelessness") and declared rather than embodied in specific human desire or loss. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he performs the required actions without hesitation or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is asserted via exposition ("driven by his own motivation") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices. Mira functions as a thematic archetype rather than a specific individual, and her dialogue ("Transition periods devour us") feels like a mouthpiece for the premise. The interaction lacks genuine interpersonal friction, resulting in a static sage-and-seeker dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—claustrophobia versus the drive to collect—is visceral and drives the narrative arc effectively. Her decision to return to the bunkers creates a meaningful character turn, transforming her fear into a tool for connection. The emotional logic holds up well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elias functions as a thematic device rather than a character with internal conflict; his "fluidly logical" perfection removes the possibility of meaningful struggle. The interaction with Mira lacks friction or subtext, reducing the cast to props for the central procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("wisely adventurous") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara faces no genuine internal conflict; her "test of soul" on the stairs is summarized rather than shown, and her final choice to be a steward is automatic, lacking the visible cost or temptation required for a 600–800 word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist’s interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("vines of dependency," "false bellows") rather than embodied emotion. The character functions more as an archetype ("Tender Shadow Keeper") than a specific individual, with the full title repeated to the point of distraction, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is defined by the recurring label "virtuously mischievous" rather than through contradictory actions or internalized struggle; his compliance with the glitchy texts is immediate and lacks friction. The "survivor" identity is stated in abstract terms ("millions evaporated") but does not manifest as a distinct emotional barrier or flaw during the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("dynasty ender") and stock melodramatic posturing ("communion with the room's ghosts") rather than embodied emotion. Elias lacks genuine internal conflict; his reactions are uniform and his "musing" replaces active psychological struggle. The "intuition" epiphany is an unearned capability leap rather than a character-driven realization.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist acts as a vessel for the prompt rather than a living character; his "withdrawn" nature is a repeated label ("withdrawn knight," "withdrawn by nature") rather than a trait tested by friction. Motivation is abstract and static, and his competence is unearned—he instinctively knows the rituals and commands the magic without error or hesitation. There is no internal contradiction or emotional cost to the choice, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "tactfully hopeful" rather than demonstrated complex behavior under pressure. The emotional arc is linear and tidy; her grief is "reshaped" by a single discovery without a dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse that forces a hard choice. The internal resolution feels unearned by the low-stakes action of opening a box.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("underestimated rebel," "carefully resourceful") rather than dramatized action. Elias lacks internal conflict or distinct interiority; his emotional state is described with generic somatic markers ("heart pounding") rather than embodied experience. The "resourcefulness" is asserted by the narrator but contradicted by the character's reliance on a magical map and a pre-existing key.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's thematic keywords rather than a fully realized protagonist. While his motivation (sister's loss) is stated, his internal landscape is repetitive ("eerie nostalgia") and lacks the contradictory impulses or specific, embodied memories required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.3)
    Lir functions as a vehicle for the aesthetic rather than a character with agency; he lacks internal contradiction, struggle, or meaningful choices under pressure.

He succeeds immediately at every task without error or doubt, preventing any character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.6)
    Motivation is stated summarily ("lately a deeper motivation stirred") rather than dramatized through pressure or costly choice. The protagonist's defining trait is handled via repetitive labeling ("uncertainly certain") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The internal shift feels automatic and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on label-speak ("balanced alchemist," "hubristic invocation") rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist's internal state is described abstractly ("luminous regret") rather than embodied in specific, conflicted action. The brother is a prop who appears solely to validate the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions more as a vehicle for the prompt's concepts than a living character; her motivation ("discover the mathematics of mercy") reads as a prompt instruction rather than a human drive. The attribute "proprioceptively enhanced" is applied as a repetitive label rather than demonstrated through distinct, grounded sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is a functional protagonist but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her motivation is stated in abstract terms ("honor overlooked histories") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or potential loss. The emotions are labeled ("transfixed," "awe," "heart raced") rather than embodied in reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theo is competent but static; his lack of fear ("felt no fear") and the ease with which he navigates the encounter drain potential tension. The "compulsion" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices, making him feel more like a function of the plot than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions more as a vehicle for the prompt's abstract concepts than a grounded character; his "hunger" for eternity is stated rather than dramatized through felt interior contradiction.

The choice to break the seal feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation to weaponize archaeology for myth-making is intellectually compelling and drives the plot. However, his interiority is often filtered through high-concept labels ("weight of unrhymed elegies") rather than grounded emotion, creating a distance that prevents deep engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction or flaw; his motivation is clear but static.

She encounters no genuine internal resistance, and her success feels unearned as she faces no significant character-testing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "perpetually learning" rather than dramatized choice or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined primarily by his role ("solemn archivist") and stated motivation ("fueling his motivation") rather than embodied desire.

He functions as a compliant vessel for the plot, passing tests without distinct character-driven agency or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist, Elias, functions as a mechanism for the plot rather than a living character with interior contradictions. His rejection of the "false comforts" is immediate and absolute, stripping the moment of genuine struggle or temptation. The physical manifestation of his effort ("sweat beaded his brow") substitutes for authentic emotional or psychological cost. He ends the story exactly as he began—determined and competent—without undergoing a meaningful internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear motivation and makes a legible choice to shift from observer to participant. However, his internal state is described through repetitive labels ("velvet disquiet") rather than embodied struggle. The realization at the end feels slightly more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara's motivation is explicitly stated ("to discover the texture") rather than dramatized through pressure or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquilly perceptive soul," "rare astonishment") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear drive, but his internal landscape relies heavily on melodramatic descriptors ("borrowed heart," "fragile loan") rather than demonstrated resilience. The "Shift-enforcers" provide a constraint for his methods but fail to manifest as a direct pressure, leaving the stakes largely abstract until the sudden introduction of Lira's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character with genuine agency or struggle. His motivation to "discover beauty in fracture" renders the central crisis (the kite crash) a moment of "anticipation" rather than conflict, effectively removing all emotional stakes. There is no internal contradiction or cost; he starts and ends with the exact same philosophy, validated without trial.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's reaction to terminal illness is detached and idealized ("plenty of time"), lacking embodied grief or struggle. Character traits are established through repeated labels ("gently systematic," "brazen calm") rather than demonstrated through complex choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("luminous skepticism," "rebellious") that contradict on-page actions; Elara accepts the alien invitation with immediate faith rather than scrutiny. The arrival of rivals triggers no territoriality or friction, flattening the "rebellious" trait into passive cooperation without emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thorne functions as a vehicle for the ritual rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure; his motivation ("soul's reckoning") is stated in exposition but not dramatized through hesitation or sacrifice. The "stoic mask" and lack of conflicting impulses flatten the internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is clear but static; Elias moves from point A to B without internal conflict or significant tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on explicit labels ("blessed pariah," "uncanny gift") rather than dramatized behavior or internal conflict.

The interiority feels generic, using stock phrases like "confusion gnawed" rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies on asserted labels ("sacredly playful," "chivalrous thief") rather than demonstrated complexity. The protagonist's reaction to the "horror" of the void—a soft laugh—undercuts the stakes, making him feel invulnerable and the threat trivial.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thorne’s motivation is compelling, and the shift from crisis actor to survivor grounds the magical elements in a tangible identity. However, the attribute "benevolently ruthless" appears more as a repeated label than a dramatized internal conflict, flattening the emotional weight of his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated, but her internal struggle remains abstract. The "fear of painful recall" is established as a barrier but is overcome without visceral hesitation or on-page cost; she simply decides to act, and the magic works instantly, bypassing the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is clear, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("winnow the self-pity from necessity") rather than embodied choice. The resolution intellectualizes the trauma, solving deep guilt with a single abstract realization rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist faces no internal conflict and succeeds without struggle or sacrifice. The trait "innocently mischievous" is applied as a repetitive static label (appearing four times) rather than being dramatized through complex, costly behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("uncertain," "fractured soul") rather than distinct behavior or choice. The transition from doubt to certainty is achieved through magical mechanics rather than psychological progression; the character acts as a vessel for the ritual rather than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character motivation relies on abstract labels ("intimately aloof") rather than dramatized behavior, and the emotional arc is passive. The protagonist faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice; his "struggle" is resolved by a magical object that grants his wish without an earned emotional cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on melodramatic labels ("screaming tenderness," "fierce ache") rather than embodied emotion. Elias's internal state is static and summarized, and his decision to use a magical object bypasses the need for genuine psychological struggle or growth. The resolution feels unearned by character agency, as the vial does the emotional heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("driven to navigate the geography of loss") rather than dramatized through difficult choices in scene. Elias functions as an obedient vessel for the plot, executing instructions without internal conflict, doubt, or a moment where he must sacrifice something of value to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias displays strong agency and competence; his decision to perform the surgery is a definitive, high-stakes choice derived from his established rationality. The internal conflict between the need for data and the need for social cohesion is dramatized effectively through action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear compulsion, but his emotional arc relies on a convenient mirror-image backstory introduced late to resolve the plot. The reaction to the suicide feels clinically detached, prioritizing the "investigation" mechanic over visceral shock or grief. The internal change is legible, but the parallel between the stranger's loss and Elias's past feels constructed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic labels ("empirically intuitive," "obsession") rather than dramatized complexity. The emotional arc resolves too tidily; the transition from despair to fulfilled connection hinges on a magical vision rather than a difficult, character-defining choice on the page. The internal struggle is stated rather than embodied in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("hollow," "disenchanted") rather than demonstrated behavior or specific interiority. Elowen's motivation is clear, but her emotional landscape is painted in broad, melodramatic strokes without the nuance of conflicting impulses. Thorne serves primarily as a prop to facilitate dialogue, lacking agency or distinct personality beyond loyalty.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characters function as vessels for abstract concepts rather than breathing people; motivation is stated via jargon ("seeking the elusive density of presence") rather than embodied need. Emotional reactions are dictated ("grinned," "recoiled slightly") and devoid of internal conflict or specific, grounded psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation functions as a mechanical magic system ("getting jealous" to trigger flight) rather than a grounded psychological drive. Interiority relies on labeled emotions ("feral nostalgia," "envy") and stock metaphors rather than specific, embodied contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara's characterization relies on unearned psychometric abilities to drive the plot, replacing genuine development with magical intuition. Her transition from aromatherapist is stated rather than felt, and her ability to divine specific dialogue from a screw lacks causal grounding. The emotional arc is told through abstract labels ("mapped emotional terrain") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    Interiority leans into melodrama ("tidal wave crashing inward") and motivation is explicitly stated ("motivation burned to transform...") rather than embodied in a difficult choice. The emotional arc resolves too neatly through a sudden shift in perspective without a struggle that earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation—guilt over a past betrayal—is clear and drives the scene effectively. However, the emotional reality is somewhat distanced by the highly stylized, performative dialogue; Theo and Elara sound identical, trading poetic axioms rather than interacting as distinct entities.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elowen functions as a cosmic archetype rather than a character, lacking internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a personal stake in the outcome. The "trembling" is a generic physical cue that doesn't ground the abstract motivation, and his success is achieved without any emotional or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear motivation ("to understand") that drives the scene. However, his internal transition from fear to "peace" is rapid and lacks the friction of a genuine dilemma; the emotional shift feels smoother than the "madness" implied by the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira's motivation is declared as an abstract "obsession" rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance. The immediate intellectual synchronization with Elias feels convenient, serving the plot rather than revealing character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is abstractly summarized ("widen perspectives") rather than embodied in action. The protagonist lacks agency, passively following a scavenger hunt trail of instructions rather than making high-stakes micro-choices that reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent presence, but Mira functions as a thematic prop rather than a realized character; her instant psychological pivot at the end ("I get it now") lacks credible internal resistance or earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is motivated by abstract labels ("preserve the weight," "regenerate covenant") rather than embodied psychological pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; she performs the ritual without hesitation or error, resulting in a flat trajectory where she functions more as a vehicle for the prompt words than a living character. The repetition of "haunted euphoria" substitutes for genuine emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("desperately jocular") and summary rather than dramatized choice. Elias’s internal struggle is resolved instantly by the magical rock interaction without the earned emotional cost required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elar’s motivation is clear but singular; he lacks the internal contradiction required for depth. The emotional arc is resolved by the magical properties of the pool rather than a difficult character choice or sacrifice. The grief feels stated rather than embodied in complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara possesses clear agency and a distinct role, but her internal struggle resolves too easily through the discovery of the pen. The recurring trait "confidently uncertain" functions more as a repeated label than a dramatized conflict that forces difficult trade-offs. While her desire to fix her mistake is clear, the emotional weight of "editing history" is dampened because the tool absorbs the cost of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is declared in dialogue ("My motivation is...") rather than dramatized through conflict or subtext. Finn offers no resistance to the disruption, agreeing instantly, which flattens the arc into a linear progression without internal struggle. The relationship lacks friction or status dynamics; they function as prompt-delivery vessels rather than people.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is clear but relies heavily on melodramatic, told-only interiority ("volcanic tenderness," "searing focus") rather than embodied emotion. Elara faces no difficult choices that reveal character; she simply proceeds through the plot's locks using her "analytically intuitive mind" as a master key without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a passive vessel for the plot rather than an agent with complex interiority; emotions are consistently labeled ("auroral sorrow," "regret") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The relationship with Kai is idealized and lacks the friction or specificity required to make their bond feel earned beyond the stated backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a functional archetype serving the theme, but his interiority relies on abstract labels ("calculated spontaneity") rather than embodied emotion. Harlan is a flat foil with stage-villain dialogue ("Bet this Aries-tailed relic..."). The rivalry lacks interpersonal depth beyond the immediate mechanical challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The characters function as allegorical archetypes rather than people; Elara is a "guardian" and Umbra is "darkness," lacking specific interiority or contradictory impulses. There is no felt cost to Elara's actions; she performs a routine magic without personal risk or difficult choice. The "silent empathy" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through a struggle that bridges their natures.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("committed chess coach") and abstract desires ("plant forests") rather than embodied emotion or difficult choices. His "gift" functions as a convenient plot tool rather than a character trait that constrains him, and he faces no internal conflict while executing a risk-free plan.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character agency is undermined by the scrimshaw, which "compels" vulnerability and removes the risk of emotional exposure. The internal conflict is resolved by a magic object rather than a difficult choice, and the sudden species change at the end feels like a convenient exit from the human stakes rather than an earned development.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's detached "blank-faced" persona contrasts effectively with her operatic performance, creating a unique character signature. However, interiority often relies on diagnostic summary ("emotional void," "love or murder") rather than dramatizing these conflicts solely through the ritual. The motivation is clear, but the emotional logic is sometimes explained to the reader rather than embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks specific, embodied interiority; his motivation is asserted via abstract labels ("aesthetically driven") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or hesitation, and he faces no meaningful opposition that tests his character. The "tremor of certainty" serves as a convenient emotional affirmation rather than a reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his defining trait ("innocently cunning") relies on repetitive labeling rather than purely dramatized behavior. His internal conflict regarding the barter resolves too conveniently; because he explicitly prefers his blindness, his refusal to trade sight lacks the friction of a true sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elowen functions as a cipher for the prompt’s philosophical assertions rather than a living character. Her internal state is described through abstract labels ("powerfully gentle resolve") rather than embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The "challenges" to her assumptions feel mechanical, lacking the visceral resistance of a true psychological arc.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as an archetype rather than a living character; her emotions are labeled with clichés ("numb despair," "withered soul") rather than embodied. She faces no internal resistance or contradictory impulses, transitioning from grief to mastery without a dramatized psychological struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("steadily curious," "onyx-ink cartomancer") rather than demonstrated behavior. Elara lacks genuine interiority or conflict; she functions merely as a technician for the plot's magical solution. Theo serves only as a delivery mechanism for the exposition, lacking agency or distinct voice. The emotional reactions are stated ("heart quickened") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is distinct, and the final choice to shatter the veil lands with clear symbolic cost. However, the crucial transformation phase is summarized ("she adapted," "shun routine") rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices in a continuous scene, distancing the reader from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype defined by role rather than a specific, flawed individual; her interiority relies on abstract sentimental labels ("shape of hope") rather than embodied feeling. The sacrifice feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice, as no alternative is seriously weighed or dramatized on the page. Elara's reactions remain static, lacking the contradictory impulses that create genuine character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.4)
    Interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("fragile convictions," "gentle core") rather than embodied reaction. The transition from betrayal to peace is smoothed over by abstract summation rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elena acts as a vessel for the prompt’s requirements rather than a human agent with coherent drives. Her decision to tunnel through a stone floor with a glass object defies character competence, and her emotional arc is resolved by external validation (telepathic plants) rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara’s motivation is stated in exposition ("needed to know") rather than dramatized through high-stakes action. Her "spatial imagination" appears as a label to solve a plot point rather than an integrated trait shaping her worldview. The emotional resolution—pivoting from deep grief to a smiling "hello" via a single vision—feels unearned and rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on romanticized labels ("moonstruck dreamer," "stifled storm") rather than contradictory impulses or specific interiority. Elara functions as a generic vessel for the prompt's concept, lacking a distinct personality or a hierarchy of values tested by the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("motivation stirs, unbidden") arrives conveniently without dramatized origin or internal struggle. There is little agency in the transformation; the character functions primarily as a vessel for the imagery rather than an active agent navigating conflicting desires. The emotional arc is conveyed through abstract metaphor ("silenced heart") rather than embodied reaction or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a passive vessel for the concept rather than a driven protagonist; he follows external instructions (the hum, the trees) without making difficult choices. His motivation is abstract ("rediscover the wild frontier"), and the lack of embodied struggle or contradictory impulses makes his transformation feel unearned. The "stray philosopher" label does not translate into unique behavior or tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("unspoken fears," "leash-broken") rather than specific, contradictory interiority or behavior. The protagonist's motivation is explicitly stated ("That was her motivation") rather than dramatized through conflict or choice. Emotional reactions are generic ("trembled," "tears mingling") and the guides function as plot devices to deliver thematic exposition rather than as complex characters.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    Character motivation relies heavily on the "archive log" info-dump to explain Thorne's depth, bypassing organic discovery. Emotional states are often labeled ("tangible grief," "unpardonable silence") rather than dramatized through interaction, making the final connection feel slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a static archetype who faces no internal conflict or contradiction. He acts as a perfect agent of the plot, achieving his goals without competence gaps, emotional struggle, or character-specific flaws that complicate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's requirements rather than a fully realized protagonist. His primary trait—tapping rhythms—feels like a contrived interface for the plot rather than an organic habit, and the "knuckles rapping the console" to encode complex biological data strains credibility. While his motivation is clear, the emotional arc from despair to hope resolves too easily via a holographic simulation rather than deep internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on the repetitive label "awkwardly confident" rather than dramatized traits or internal complexity. Motivation is abstract ("meaning in the mess") and lacks a concrete psychological anchor or personal cost. Elara succeeds without struggle or genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira is a coherent archetype ("insurgent grandmother") but lacks internal friction; her motivation to "evolve tradition" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The convenience of her already possessing the crucial embryo in her satchel flattens her agency, as she solves the central problem through luck rather than a character-defining effort. Emotions are often labeled ("startled," "triumphant") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization is undermined by the intrusion of diagnostic labels into interiority and dialogue ("somatic markers from some strike of life"). The protagonist’s transition from a trauma freeze to a wise mentor occurs too abruptly, relying on therapeutic exposition rather than earned emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for prompt keywords rather than a living character. Emotions are reported via abstract labels ("luminescent ache," "crestfallen") rather than embodied in reaction or physiology. The explicit labeling of his dialogue as "rhetorical" destroys interior immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("consciously wild," "feral grace") rather than demonstrated behavior or choice. The internal state is static, with the protagonist's "serene anger" stated five times without evolving or driving a difficult decision. The revelation is delivered via exposition rather than earned through character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist’s internal state is defined almost exclusively by the repeated label "bravely conflicted" rather than through embodied hesitation or nuanced thought. While the choice to act is clear, the emotional transition happens instantly ("action had chosen for her"), bypassing the struggle necessary to make the agency feel earned. The character functions more as a vehicle for the prompt words than a living entity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara lacks internal conflict; her pacifism is a declared trait rather than a tested struggle. The resolution relies on "inculcated" plants acting as proxies for violence, allowing her to escape the moral cost of her stance. Her "senseless perceptivity" functions more as a superhero ability than a character flaw or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; his "cool-headed" nature is asserted repeatedly but never truly tested by a temptation to be otherwise. He faces no internal conflict, and his success requires no personal change or emotional cost, resulting in a static procedural arc. The "shift in his bones" is a generic somatic cue that replaces genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on label-like adverbs ("devotedly observant," "solemnly") rather than demonstrated behavior. Thorne acts as a convenient plot device, handing over the evidence of his own deception without credible motivation, and his emotional collapse is immediate and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Character motivation is grounded in a specific, tangible trait (his bare arms vs. his trade) that pays off beautifully at the climax. The transition from the "arrogant" past self to the guilt-ridden present is handled efficiently, though the internal shift relies slightly on summary. The final choice to mark himself is a strongly motivated, character-defining act.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by explicit diagnostic labels ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") rather than dramatized behavior, creating a flat, functional character. There is no internal conflict or genuine struggle; her "whimsical nature" simply solves the problem with magical ease, lacking any personal cost or emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on repeated labels ("gentle radical," "arms of steel") rather than embodied psychology. Kael's transformation acts as a mechanical switch-flip, lacking the internal resistance or gradual erosion required for a believable redemption arc.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks agency; her despair is resolved not by a difficult choice or sacrifice, but by accepting a magical fix that mends her life without cost. Reginald functions as a deus ex machina rather than a catalyst for character revelation, reducing Elena to a passive recipient of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist's defining trait, &quot;skeptic,&quot; is stated but contradicted by her actions; leaping from a static shock to a crystal-based light painting ritual to prove telepathy reads as mystical, not skeptical. The internal conflict is labeled (&quot;doubt gnawed&quot;) rather than dramatized through resistance, and the resolution comes too easily, lacking the struggle of a true skeptic dismantling their own worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.3)
    Lira’s motivation is stated clearly but encounters no genuine resistance; the "overload" crisis is resolved instantly with a thought, lacking the friction of a true dilemma. The transformation feels granted by the artifact rather than earned through character agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a cipher for the plot rather than a character with internal contradictions or genuine struggle. His actions lack hesitation or difficulty; he moves from discovery to solution with a "quiet inspiration" that feels like an inserted label rather than an emotional state. There is no felt cost to his choices; he is simply the hand that turns the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a consistent archetype, but his motivation relies heavily on the repeated mantra "to find where unused courage waits," which reads as label-speak rather than embodied drive. The interaction with Lena feels staged, with dialogue that serves exposition more than organic character friction. While the internal conflict between the cyanide and the stimulant is clear, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is abstract and explicitly "told" rather than dramatized ("motivation burned clear: to distill complexity into essence"). The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion, functioning primarily as a vessel for the prompt's required philosophical stance. The "struggle" is purely intellectual, resolved without character-specific agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kai functions as an archetype rather than a character; he possesses no internal conflict, flaws, or contradictory impulses. His journey is one of validation rather than struggle—he starts zen and ends zen, with the narrative treating him as a perfect vessel for the theme. The "realization" comes without personal cost or a test of his values, resulting in a static protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("protected vulnerability incarnate," "fragile as sea glass") rather than dramatized behavior. The interaction lacks genuine friction; Mira functions as a passive vessel for Elara's wisdom rather than a complex agent, resulting in a therapeutic dynamic devoid of earned intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.4)
    Motivation is stated explicitly ("burned with the motivation...") rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices. The protagonist experiences no internal conflict; she desires connection and achieves it instantly without hesitation or psychological cost. Emotions are conveyed through abstract adjectives ("fragile," "brittle") rather than embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies on repeated labels ("inevitably whimsical") rather than demonstrated traits or costly choices. Elara's internal struggle is resolved by external coincidence rather than agency; the emotional arc feels unearned and cloying.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal life feels robotic due to the mechanical repetition of the phrase "cautiously hopeful" to satisfy the prompt. While her actions align with her goals, the lack of deep, contradictory interiority or genuine moral struggle limits her to a functional role rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("prudent nature," "wistful longing") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's decision to play a loud organ in an unstable ruin contradicts the established "prudent" attribute without sufficient internal friction or acknowledgement of the risk, making the motivation feel compliant to plot needs rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is defined by explicit labels ("face blind," "methodical," "dormant empathy") rather than demonstrated character traits. Her sudden shift from methodical counting to a blood-magic ritual lacks psychological groundwork, making her actions servant to the plot rather than internal logic. The motivation to "awaken empathy" is told to the reader repeatedly but never dramatized through a difficult interpersonal choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on the told attribute "nervously confident," which appears four times as a label rather than being dramatized through specific, contradictory behavior. Elara’s internal life is summarized through adjectives ("idealistic," "defiant") rather than action, and Dr. Hale functions as a flat antagonist who collapses without genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("Dynamically observant by trade") rather than demonstrated behavior. The motivation is stated verbatim in exposition ("Driven by a deep motivation to sculpt possibility...") instead of emerging through subtext or action. Emotional states are described with abstract adjectives ("luminous wonder") rather than embodied visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elias acts as a static vehicle for the prompt's labels rather than a breathing character; he displays "polished calm" without internal variation or struggle. His emotional state is summarized rather than embodied, and he lacks a flaw or contradictory impulse that would generate genuine agency under pressure. Raoul is a stock antagonist who functions only to facilitate a rushed climax.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("spirit," "solace," "burden") rather than embodied complexity. Thorne’s motivation is linear and lacks the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for depth; his choice to help is immediate and devoid of personal cost. The relationship is idealized and smooth, missing the "crucible" dynamics that create genuine dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thorne’s internal conflict is clear but relies heavily on adjectival labeling ("guarded nature," "unyielding guard") rather than dramatized behavior prior to the climax. The transition from guarded to vulnerable is driven more by the magical mechanism of the seed than by a nuanced psychological struggle. The final realization feels summarized ("no villainy excused... just a man fractured") rather than viscerally earned through the action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("purposefully curious") rather than demonstrated traits. Interiority is summarized through abstract keywords ("anxious elation") instead of embodied emotion or specific psychological texture. The protagonist faces no internal conflict or difficult trade-offs, functioning primarily as a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on told labels ("reckless idealist," "fiercely gentle") rather than demonstrated traits enacted through complex choices. Elara's internal landscape is generic grief without specific, idiosyncratic detail, and her "recklessness" is never tested by genuine risk of failure. The contradictory trait of being "fiercely gentle" is repeated as a mantra but not dramatized in a way that creates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Harl’s background as a roadie-turned-appraiser creates a distinct, grounded protagonist. However, his interiority often relies on explicit labeling ("longing that hollowed his chest," "confidently uncertain") rather than embodied emotion. The transition from grief to crystallized purpose feels rushed and summary-heavy, lacking the struggle required for a deeper connection.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elias is consistent but static, defined largely by the prompt's required adverbs ("kindly," "methodical") rather than dramatized choice. He faces the crisis with immediate competence and no internal friction; his "haunted ambitions" are told as backstory rather than felt as a present struggle. The emotional arc feels labeled ("heart aching," "at peace") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a passive patient rather than an agent; her primary choice is a compliant nod, and her internal conflict is summarized via labels ("archivist" vs. "cartographer") rather than dramatized through behavior. The librarian remains a static functionary whose routine lacks personal risk, interior doubt, or evolutionary cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated ("motivation forged in isolation") rather than dramatized through specific choices. Interiority relies on label-heavy backstory about Mira rather than embodied emotion, and the final decision feels driven by plot convenience rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("truth-seeking river chronicler," "daringly methodical") rather than embodied choice. The central psychological conceit—being three weeks off antipsychotics—is stated but contradicts the character's hyper-lucid, organized behavior on the page; the "raw edges" are described but not dramatized in thought or action. The emotional arc relies on external validation (finding his specific history on a wall) rather than internal struggle or earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on label-only emotions ("cautious exuberance," "exhilarated," "thrill") rather than embodied experience or internal contradiction. The protagonist is an archetype with no distinct voice or history, and her "motivation burned steady" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is declared via abstract labels ("dream of unfettered melody") rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. The resolution relies on a convenient backstory trait (plant telepathy) that removes the need for a hard sacrifice, resulting in a "have it all" ending that lacks the felt cost required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lirien's motivation is clearly established, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("duality," "lucidly watchful") rather than embodied feeling or subtext. The protagonist's desperation is stated ("motivation burning fierce"), but the emotional arc feels mechanical, moving from problem to solution without deep psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist is defined by the repetitive label "kindly decisive" rather than embodied action or conflict. Her internal state is summarized via abstract descriptors ("spirit lagged") rather than dramatized, and the lack of present-tense relational pressure leaves her static.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's internal pivot from "ironclad resolve" to total forgiveness is unearned, facilitated by a magical object (the cloak) rather than genuine psychological struggle. The "friend" remains an abstract concept, making the relationship dynamics theoretical rather than felt. Emotional states are labeled ("certainty," "nuance," "vulnerability") rather than embodied in action or complex interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is viscerally embodied in her physical sensations of aging ("anchor of her own mortality," "gravity that dragged"). The internal conflict is sharp: the desire for youth versus the terrifying cost of self-erasure. Voss acts as a perfect foil, his physical state manifesting the story's central conceit without needing exposition dumps. The choice at the end is earned by the scenic pressure and the visual proof of the ripples.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("historically reverent," "weathered resolve") rather than dramatized choice. Thren acts as a passive observer of time rather than an agent; his internal life is summarized as "waiting" without specific, embodied emotional contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    Thorne has a clear objective and consistent interiority, but the "underachieving" trait operates more as a repeated label than a dramatized flaw; his success is swift and highly competent, undercutting the premise of mediocrity. The decision to rebel is immediate, lacking a moment of agonizing trade-off or hesitation that would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is declared via narration ("That motivation burned brighter...") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Elias lacks interior contradiction; his arc is a linear retrieval quest with no hesitation or psychological cost. The reunion feels like a reward for attendance rather than a result of character agency or growth.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("quietly enthusiastic," "cast lots decision maker") rather than embodied behavior or internal conflict. Elara faces no genuine internal dilemma; her tools are described as "infallible," removing the possibility of error or meaningful struggle. The emotional landscape is static, defined by the repeated assertion of her enthusiasm rather than a dynamic reaction to the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character motivation is stated explicitly ("Her motivation burned deep") rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional arc resolves too neatly via a procedural ritual, lacking the resistance or internal contradiction required for depth. The phrase "motivation fulfilled" in the narrative voice flattens the character's interiority into a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjectival labeling ("earnestly naive," "brittle intensity") rather than dramatized behavior or interiority. The protagonist's internal struggle is summarized through these labels ("devotion teetered on shattering") rather than shown through distinct, conflicting impulses in the moment. The shift from doubt to resilience feels mechanical, driven by the narrator's assertion rather than earned emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("motivation burned steady: to spin stories") rather than embodied desire or struggle. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction, and the guilt over the mother's death is resolved too easily through a shared ritual without genuine emotional friction. The interaction with Mira feels functional and devoid of necessary suspicion or conflicting agendas.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated via abstract labels ("harmonize logic and intuition") rather than dramatized through struggle. The protagonist's "sentimental" trait appears as a prop (letters) rather than a flaw or driver that complicates the scene. Emotional shifts are described with diagnostic language ("sentimental ache") instead of embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation is defined largely by abstract labels ("watcher's burden," "trust was fragile") rather than organic, embodied interiority. While Elias's goal is clear, his emotional state is reported to the reader ("failure now would shatter it") rather than dramatized through complex reaction or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation ("burned beneath his numbness") contradicts the primary trait; the protagonist's emotional state is diagnosed via narration rather than dramatized through cold behavior. Internal conflict is resolved by a magical external fix rather than earned character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias functions as a puzzle-solving device rather than a character; he lacks internal conflict or genuine emotional cost. The moment he whispers "nonsense syllables" to a seed breaks behavioral credibility, reading as a prompt-forced mechanism rather than human action. His "resolute" nature is stated but not tested by any difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but characterization relies heavily on the repetitive telling label "mournfully eager" rather than distinct, embodied interiority. Elias functions more as a mechanism for the prompt's elements than a fully realized character with internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is labeled "feral," yet the narration is highly intellectual, poetic, and abstract ("illumination frayed into shadow's eager grasp"), creating a dissonance between the character concept and the voice. The internal conflict is stated ("feral instinct warring with lucid resolve") rather than dramatized through behavior or sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless") rather than embodied complexity or contradictory impulses. The internal state is summarized through adjectives, preventing genuine interiority, and the emotional shift feels distinct from the mechanical process rather than driven by it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is a competent, proactive protagonist with a unique worldview ("fantasy practicality"), but her internal struggle is resolved somewhat abstractly. The pivotal moment relies on a mental checklist ("discarding assumptions") rather than a visceral emotional choice or sacrifice, making the character arc feel slightly mechanical despite strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on the label "resiliently positive" (repeated three times) rather than demonstrated action. Elias's reaction to a reality-breaking crisis is "chuckling" and a grin, which undercuts the gravity of the situation and destroys credibility. The encounter with the parallel self lacks genuine friction or psychological depth, resolving instantly with a handshake.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist has a clear, stated motivation ("sought the texture of connection"), but his interiority relies on abstract labels ("mother," "brother," "betrayal") rather than specific, lived history. The emotional arc functions mechanically, with the character feeling like a vessel for the concept rather than a distinct individual.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on told traits (e.g., "balanced curiosity," "motivation burned singularly") rather than dramatized complexity. The dynamic between Kai and Elara is a functional mentorship that lacks significant interpersonal friction or subtext to test their declared attributes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("persistently curious") rather than organic traits revealed through struggle. Elara functions primarily as a plot device to ferry messages, lacking internal conflict or a distinct personality beyond her stated motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("claustrophobia raged," "panic clawed") rather than embodied sensation. The resolution of her fear feels unearned, as the magical codex bypasses the need for her to confront the physical constraints of the cave with her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.6)
    Motivation is stated explicitly ("Her motivation burned quiet") rather than dramatized through action. The protagonist's internal state relies on repetitive labels like "death certificate error" and "midnight solace" instead of embodied emotion or psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thorne functions as an archetypal figure rather than a realized character; his motivation is stated in summary ("driven to translate") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The internal conflict regarding the "cursed" diamond is purely theoretical, as the risk never manifests in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara’s internal struggle is summarized through adjectival telling ("bitterness festered," "motivation burned") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her emotional transformation is instantaneous and unearned; she simply speaks into the phone and her bitterness vanishes without resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated ("fire of her unyielding motivation") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal conflict.

There is no moment of doubt or renunciation; her competence is absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but his internal landscape is somewhat static. His "respectful rebellion" is told rather than dramatized through high-stakes choice; the patrol encounter is resolved too easily with a smile, missing a chance to show the cost of his double life.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias acts as a functional vessel for the narrative but lacks embodied interior struggle; the pivotal decision to break a decades-long vow of silence happens instantly without resistance or felt cost. The trait "quietly persistent" is applied as a repetitive label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated ("deepest motivation burned") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices. The "sanely eccentric" trait functions as a label to justify behavior rather than a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a coherent focalizer, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, romanticized labels ("soul's void," "cipher of longing") rather than grounded human reaction. The motivation is clear but archetypal, and the emotional cost—while stated—feels aesthetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's motivation to free others and himself is clear, but characterization relies heavily on repeated labels ("unassumingly bold") rather than dramatized behavior. The internal state is described via abstract summary ("ache for freedoms," "terror of failure") rather than shown through specific, embodied reactions. The emotional shift at the end feels mechanically mandated rather than organically earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but he lacks deep interior conflict or contradictory impulses. His primary trait, "chronically curious," serves as a label rather than a driver of difficult on-page choices. The emotional arc is linear, moving from seeking to finding without a moment of genuine doubt or moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "combative tenderness" rather than organic behavior. Elara's internal conflict is stated ("storm behind her calm facade") but not dramatized through difficult choices; she acts largely as a functional mentor archetype. Kai remains a reactive prop for the archivist's lessons, lacking distinct interiority or agency beyond obedience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Lirien lacks interior conflict or contradictory impulses; he functions as a magical device rather than a character making high-stakes choices. His "wisdom" and "creativity" are asserted via labels rather than demonstrated through struggle or error, resulting in a flat, infallible protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lirien's motivation is clear and established early, but his emotional interiority relies heavily on the repeated label "lucid unrest" rather than specific, embodied reactions. While his commitment to the task is evident, his internal arc feels static, driven more by instruction than a difficult, character-defining choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("methodically curious," "shielded openness") rather than dramatized behavior. Motivation is stated explicitly as "born from his own unspoken grief" but lacks on-page emotional weight or struggle. The protagonist succeeds in every action without facing internal contradiction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for thematic assertions than a living character; her "analytic" attribute is contradicted when she accepts a temporal impossibility (a 1937 plane in a 1916 wreck) without scrutiny. The interaction with "Elias" feels performative, lacking the internal friction or fear required to make the relationship compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elowen is defined almost entirely by labels and explicit statements of motivation rather than demonstrated character traits. She lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her desire to "articulate unspoken needs" is told to the reader, not dramatized through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lira functions primarily as a vessel for the backstory rather than an agent of active choice; her "tender resolve" upon discovering her identity feels unearned and lacks embodied struggle. The emotion is summarized via the "affectionate detachment" label rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The revelation of her parentage dissolves potential conflict instantly rather than forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's behavior contradicts his established expertise; an aviation meteorologist would recognize the immediate fatality of stratospheric exposure in an open basket, yet he ignores hypoxia to wax poetic. The emotional arc relies on sentimental assertion rather than embodied struggle, resulting in a static character who serves as a mouthpiece for the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s prosopagnosia is not merely a trait but the engine of her competence, allowing her to perceive the "pure form" required for the fractal array where the guild failed. Her motivation to preserve an "eternal" sky against the demolition is distinct and drives her agency through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by repeated labels ("diligently curious") rather than demonstrated traits. Her success is immediate and unearned, lacking the internal conflict or visible cost required to make her agency feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias lacks internal conflict or contradiction; he operates as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a character making hard choices. The motivation is stated ("driven by a singular motivation") rather than dramatized through struggle, and he succeeds without paying a visible emotional or tactical price. The absence of flaws or distinct interiority beyond abstract longing leaves him flat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on epithets ("callused hands," "haunted by loss") and group summary rather than dramatized behavior. The characters function as a monolithic unit ("The family") with no distinct internal lives or frictional dynamics on the page. The "doubt" expressed is resolved instantly without genuine interpersonal or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, anchored in a specific backstory of watching innocents lost. However, interiority is filtered through heavy stylistic abstraction ("bruised awe," "weight of epochs") rather than grounded, embodied emotion, creating a distance that mutes the impact of the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, motivated protagonist with clear internal conflict (duty vs. resentment) that drives the action. While his reluctance is stated frequently ("hated this duty," "grudging motivation") rather than purely shown through hesitation, his competence and the final acceptance of his role provide a satisfying, character-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the protagonist's interiority relies on stock metaphors ("guilt he carried like a dissonant chord") rather than embodied emotion. The emotional arc is linear and resolves through a convenient epiphany rather than a struggle between contradictory impulses. The "symphonic" trait feels like an authorial overlay rather than an organic part of the character's psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Character motivation is sharp, executed through the unique mechanism of "quantifying absence," which grounds the abstract interiority in specific biographical metrics. The final choice to dissolve is earned by the accumulated weight of the "voids" established early on. The transition from vendor to seeker feels coherent, though emotional embodiment is somewhat stylized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.3)
    Character motivation is stated clearly, but the emotional arc resolves too neatly through a procedural magic system rather than internal struggle. The shift from "grief" to "acceptance" happens via summary montage, lacking a specific decision point with felt cost. The use of "neural paths" in interiority breaks the fantasy chef persona.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.3)
    The protagonist is a collection of prompt labels rather than a person; traits like &quot;empathetically decisive&quot; are stated as adjectives rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or reluctance; she acts with perfect competence and faces no emotional cost. The characterization relies entirely on summary and assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on the repeated label "helix-minded" rather than distinct interiority or psychology. The protagonist lacks human flaws and functions merely as a vessel for the prompt's terminology, with no demonstrated agency beyond the script's demands.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a cipher for the setting rather than a character with distinct desires or contradictions. Her motivation ("find where forgotten combinations hide") remains abstract and high-concept without personal grounding or felt stakes. The "latent blaze" is applied as a label for emotion rather than dramatized through specific, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or agency beyond the linear execution of a stated desire; he encounters no meaningful resistance that tests his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias functions as a consistent archetype, but his internal journey is largely asserted through abstract metaphors rather than dramatized. The "struggle" he values is bypassed by the worry stone, which acts as a guide rather than forcing a difficult, character-defining choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a collection of curated labels ("eclectic pacifist," "philosopher") rather than a character with embodied interiority. His struggle is purely mechanical—tuning a lock—and lacks the internal cost or contradictory impulses required for depth. The "theatrical sincerity" reads as a convenient excuse for melodramatic dialogue rather than a genuine character flaw or trait.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear, and the doodling habit adds specific character shading. However, the heavy use of summary ("Days blurred," "Weeks passed") prevents the dramatization of micro-choices and contradictory impulses within a specific high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is legible but relies on standard backstory (dead brother) rather than immediate pressure. The protagonist's final action—taking the artifact—is a physical retrieval without a complicating internal choice or ethical hesitation, resulting in a lack of character depth at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elias functions as a robotic vehicle for the prompt rather than a realized character. His traits ("rapidly adapting") are applied as explicit labels rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or internal contradictions. There is no emotional cost or conflicting impulse on the page; he simply executes a procedural task with perfect competence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated as exposition ("burned with the motivation to certify...") rather than dramatized through struggle. Internal conflict is raised ("fettered by doubt") but resolved immediately without on-page cost or difficult choice. Elyra functions more as a vehicle for the prompt's thematic thesis than a character navigating genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the internal arc relies on diagnostic summary rather than dramatized experience. The pivotal realization ("failure stemmed not from weakness, but from isolation") is delivered as a label-heavy epiphany—classic "therapy-speak"—rather than an earned emotional shift derived from the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivations are abstract and intellectual ("mathematics of emotion") rather than visceral, reducing the characters to functional archetypes. The emotional "swap" relies on labeling feelings ("dread," "calm curiosity") instead of embodied sensation, making the internal experience feel theoretical. Mira functions primarily as a prop to enable Elias's process rather than a fully realized agent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by prompt labels ("jittery") that evaporate instantly upon the encounter without creating genuine struggle or impacting tactics. Motivation is stated clearly, but the internal landscape is flat, resolving into a convenient confidence that feels unearned by the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies on explicit labels ("attentive mystic," "empiricist") rather than dramatized complexity. The emotional backstory (wife leaving, father's rage) appears as summary clichés to force depth rather than emerging from the scene's pressure. The transition from skeptic to believer is instantaneous, lacking the internal struggle or resistance required for a believable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined by static labels ("wistful," "latent") rather than embodied agency or contradictory interiority. Her ultimate sacrifice feels like the execution of a prompted ritual rather than a pressured, character-specific choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjectival labeling ("meek," "quietly determined") rather than dramatized choice. Elar lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his motivation is stated in backstory summary rather than felt in a pressurized scene. The emotional arc is linear and predictable, moving from meek determination to bold determination without a moment of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is largely externalized to the "cyclically spontaneous" trait, reducing agency to a biological clock rather than character desire. Emotional states are summarized with labels ("tang of betrayal") rather than embodied, and the mentor's dialogue is purely expository.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on static labels ("reticent," "warmly observant") rather than dramatized behavior, resulting in stock types. The protagonist's arc is severed at the climax by the meta-textual breakdown ("Wait, recount precisely later"), preventing any earned emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias acts as a one-note archetype defined by "manic glee" and the repeated tag "shadowed elation," lacking internal complexity or contradiction. His motivation to upend the world is stated as a reaction to "screen-bound stupor" but lacks personal grounding or dramatized triggers beyond the immediate vision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("watchful," "dye master") rather than active choices under pressure. Her primary action—sitting and waiting for sunlight to hit a wing—is passive, and the resolution returns her to her initial state without a visible cost or significant transformation. The "quietly explosive" trait appears as an inserted descriptor rather than an embodied emotion driving behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype (the wise mender) rather than a character under pressure; he lacks internal contradiction or flaws. His motivation to understand the trees is stated but feels parallel to the sextant plot until the convenient convergence at the end. There is no felt cost to his actions, as the environment actively heals him.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a generic "healer" archetype without internal contradiction or genuine agency. Her "scattered" nature is stated but functions only as atmospheric backstory, not a flaw that complicates choices; she succeeds by "pressing on" rather than making a difficult trade-off, and the perfect resolution of her memory issues feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's pivotal choice—taking the applicant's invitation for herself while leaving him behind—contradicts her established empathy without acknowledging the moral dissonance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("creeping normality noticer") rather than dramatized behavior; his internal state is summarized through theme statements rather than felt conflict. Mira’s rapid transition from estranged accuser to forgiving sister lacks emotional friction or a credible catalyst in the scene. The reconciliation feels like a predetermined plot point rather than a reaction to the specific pressure of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist Elias is defined entirely by the repeated label "gently meticulous" and his competence, lacking internal conflict or contradiction. He functions as a plot device to solve the library's decay without facing a character-defining choice or emotional cost. The absence of a personal stake or a moment of doubt makes him read as an archetype rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lila's motivation (recording the sound of trust breaking) is distinct and drives the plot, but her internal state is often summarized ("motive burned steady"). The required trait "curiously steadfast" appears as a repeated label rather than a demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara’s skepticism is stated ("feigned to doubt") rather than dramatized through resistance; she abandons her defining trait instantly upon hearing a single explanation. The transition from skeptic to believer lacks a "felt cost" or struggle, reading as a convenient switch to resolve the plot. Her interiority is drowned out by the descriptive density of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on stated labels ("accountant with a hobbyist's past," "bottled storm") rather than dramatized complexity. The transition from practical accountant to artist is instantaneous and frictionless, lacking the internal resistance or specific behavioral contradiction required for depth. The protagonist possesses a convenient "mnemonic gift" that functions as a plot device rather than a flawed, integrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara's motivation is established, but she functions primarily as a passive barometer for truth in the middle beats, where obstacles are resolved by others (the child, the worker) rather than her direct agency. Her physical "wilting" creates pressure, but her choices are mostly navigational until the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fleshed-out character; her motivation ("to preserve the color of wonder") is abstract and stated rather than embodied in difficult choices. The "seasonal muteness" is an intriguing trait but operates largely as window dressing; it facilitates her work rather than forcing a tangible trade-off or cost during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Zeta’s motivation is legible, but interiority often relies on summary labels ("motivation burned clear," "nostalgia surged") rather than embodied processing. The conflict between logic and "primal urges" is stated but feels slightly imposed to drive the plot, and the emotional connection to the relics is more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elena is a functional archetype rather than a realized character; her "discerning" nature is stated but not tested by genuine difficulty. She faces no internal conflict and pays no emotional cost for her success, remaining static throughout. The neighbors serve as mere dispensers of plot tokens rather than distinct individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradiction; she is defined almost exclusively by the repeated label "calm defiance." Her success is never in doubt, and her emotional arc is a flat line of competence without genuine vulnerability or cost. The "colleagues" appear as late-stage props rather than relational pressure, leaving the character isolated in a vacuum of capability.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    Character motivation is asserted via cliché ("burning motivation") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The protagonist's internal life lacks specificity, relying on generic emotional markers ("world tilt subtly") without a felt personal cost beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a functional operator of the plot rather than a character under pressure; he faces no internal contradiction or meaningful resistance. His success is immediate and absolute, lacking the requisite on-page cost or struggle to make the victory earned. The "solitary summoner" archetype remains static, offering competence without the vulnerability or flaw needed for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.0)
    Character motivations are stated clearly ("motivation burned fiercely") but executed through repetitive telling rather than complex interiority. Harlan's rapid pivot from secrecy to revelation lacks the necessary friction to make the emotional release earned. The relationship dynamic relies on the label "mysteriously familiar" rather than dramatized chemistry.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by oxymoronic labels ("charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant") rather than distinct, embodied traits. Her internal conflict is resolved repeatedly by the insertion of the phrase "ghostly resolve" rather than through a dramatized struggle or a costly decision in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("to forgive the unfinished") but remains abstract and summarized rather than embodied in struggle. The protagonist arrives with the decision already made, reducing the scene to a procedural ritual without internal conflict or oscillation. The character feels like a vessel for the prompt's thematic requirements rather than a living person making a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elyra functions as a vehicle for the prompt rather than a fully realized character; her "richly perceptive" nature is asserted via labels rather than demonstrated through complex observation. Motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract, and her reaction to the climax is mechanical, lacking genuine internal conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a magical operator rather than a character under pressure; she performs the ritual without facing internal contradiction or hesitation. Her motivation to "salvage something pure" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult tradeoff or cost. The lack of a personal stake in the outcome reduces her to a plot device for the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist serves as a thematic vehicle rather than a living character; his motivation is abstract ("appreciate hidden effort") and lacks visceral drive. The central action—using a delicate bamboo tea whisk to mend a heavy fishing net—strains physical credibility and undermines his established competence. Interiority relies on philosophical sermonizing rather than embodied emotion or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias faces a clear internal conflict between his identity as a debunker and the moral necessity of the lie. However, the pivot from zealot to protector relies on summarized internal processing ("questioned his crusade") rather than a gradual, dramatized accumulation of doubt. The trait "sharply observant" is stated frequently but feels slightly performative rather than organically woven into his behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elias is a cipher defined by labels ("visionary," "illicit hunger") rather than embodied emotion or specific interiority. His reaction to the climax is passive observation, and his motivation remains an abstract declaration without felt personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is an archetypal figure defined by explicit labels ("vagrant penny poet") rather than complex behavior. His motivation is stated directly ("driven by a singular motivation") rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices. The "doubt" regarding the loft's grip is introduced and resolved too quickly to serve as genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist’s internal state is conveyed through labeled abstractions ("logically emotional," "rational calculus fused with raw ache") rather than embodied behavior or difficult choices. The motivation involving a past lover feels tacked on to justify the stakes, and the emotional reaction to the crisis is melodramatic ("tasted of salt and spectral desire") rather than grounded. The character functions as a vehicle for prompt elements rather than a living person with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on prompt labels ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful") rather than demonstrated traits. Internal conflict is summarized as "burning wild inside" but lacks on-page contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The protagonist feels like a functional vessel for the premise rather than a living entity with distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara's internal state is conveyed through diagnostic labels ("motivation crystallized," "controlling influence") rather than organic reaction. The pivot from a death investigation to a personal epiphany feels largely unmotivated by the immediate scene, relying on the "entangled memories" shortcut to force character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is legible but performed through melodramatic internal monologue rather than specific, embodied action. Characters rely on stock archetypes (the guilt-ridden priest, the sage craftsman) and speak in thematic thesis statements ("Second opinions are the soul of repair") rather than natural dialogue. The emotional arc feels unearned because the protagonist's primary action is passive observation of a repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a character with embodied conflict; her struggles are summarized ("Days blurred") rather than dramatized in scene. The attribute "steadily curious" is applied as a recurring label (6 uses) rather than demonstrated through costly micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is stated explicitly ("to ring a bell") but lacks a felt, on-page price or obstacle that tests it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot, but her characterization relies heavily on the inserted label "brightly attentive" rather than dramatized traits. While her motivation to uncover the truth is clear, the immersion is shattered by meta-commentary artifacts (e.g., "[412—no, recount properly]") that confuse the narrative voice with a drafting process.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.4)
    Thorne is a functional archetype defined by explicit labels ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") rather than dramatized complexity. She faces external opposition but endures no internal struggle, paying no emotional or tangible price for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is distinct but the character's psychology relies on stated labels ("loose grip," "motivation burned steady") rather than embodied reaction. The transformation "woke up changed" is asserted twice rather than dramatized through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "wise stranger" archetype (Theo) lacks genuine interiority, functioning solely as a thematic delivery system with explicit labels ("motivation clear—to nurture intersubjective understanding") replacing dramatized drive. Elena’s emotional pivot is unearned; she accepts the stranger's reframing immediately ("words spilling like overripe fruit") without the resistance or friction that characterizes authentic human psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is functional but lacks internal life; motivation is explicitly stated rather than felt. The repeated labeling of the character as "strangely honest" (six times) substitutes for dramatized integrity or difficult choices. No visible cost or flaw complicates the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elara functions as a magical device rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, doubt, or distinct flaws. Her "perceptively calm" nature serves as a repeated label rather than a tested trait, and she succeeds without paying any emotional or physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The character's motivation to decode the pattern is clear and drives the plot, but her interiority relies heavily on the repeated label "weathered innocence" rather than dramatized nuance. While she makes a decisive choice to testify, the emotional cost feels somewhat abstract and asserted rather than deeply embodied in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct protagonist whose unique constraint (precognitive forgetfulness) drives the narrative method, but his internal life relies heavily on the narrator labeling his "tidal longing" rather than dramatizing the emotional cost. The motivation is clear, but the emotional progression is stated more than felt through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the repetitive tag "luminous ache," which substitutes for genuine interiority or grounded emotion. His "sage intuition" acts as a plot device rather than a character trait, and his motivation remains abstract ("restructuring time") without visceral connection to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a flawless plot device rather than a character with internal conflict or doubt. Harlan and Lena lack agency and resistance; their deep estrangement melts instantly without the friction or contradictory impulses required for realistic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a cipher to execute the plot rather than a fully realized character; her "obsession" is stated but not dramatized through difficult choices or sacrifice. Her success is immediate and lacks the friction of genuine incompetence or fear, resulting in a flat emotional arc where "relearning" feels like a download rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for keywords rather than a coherent agent. Her transition from "skeptic" to magic-user is instant and unearned, lacking internal conflict or credible psychological progression. The trait "shrewdly innocent" is applied as a repetitive label rather than demonstrated through complex behavior, and her motivation ("yearned to mend") is stated in abstract terms that never translate into felt human desire.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a vessel for prompt keywords rather than a character with embodied interiority; her "vow" is abstract and imposes no visible constraint on her actions. There is no internal conflict or decision-making under pressure, as the magic solution works instantly without demanding a personal price or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies almost entirely on diagnostic labels ("watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive") rather than demonstrated behavior. Elara and Kai lack internal contradiction or distinct voices, speaking in identical therapeutic metaphors. The emotional arc is smooth and frictionless, with no on-page struggle or cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias is a functional vehicle for the premise, but his interiority relies heavily on summarized emotion ("mind a battlefield") rather than conflicting impulses enacted in the scene. The interaction with the "cameos" is ritualistic and uniform, preventing deeper character revelation through distinct tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on labels ("whimsical," "mischievous") rather than dramatized choice or contradictory impulse. Elowen faces no internal struggle or competence gap; her success is linear and inevitable, lacking the necessary friction or cost to earn the "legend" status.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lir’s motivation is clear and the ritual provides a strong framework for agency. However, his competence is nearly absolute; he endures physical discomfort but faces no difficult tactical trade-offs or internal contradictions, making the characterization feel slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions more as a procedural device than a fully realized character; his motivation ("store wonder") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he encounters a technical puzzle, applies expertise, and succeeds without personal cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elara functions primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's mechanics rather than a fully realized character. While her motivation is stated ("collect weights"), her internal landscape is generic, and the "panic" she feels is told rather than embodied. The "thief's burden" offers a glimpse of specific emotional pressure, but it resolves quickly without forcing a character-defining choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    Character motivation is clear but delivered through explicit labeling ("harvest lessons from loss") rather than dramatized struggle. Interiority feels slightly performative, relying on poetic summary ("grief's forge") rather than specific, contradictory psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias shows clear agency and contradictory impulses (ambition vs. regret) that drive the scene. The confrontation with the ghost externalizes his internal conflict well, and the final choice to abandon the wheel carries a visible, felt cost (loss of the "spin" and sky). The shift from resolute bargaining to acceptance is slightly rapid but earned by the ghost's refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions as a competent archetypal engineer rather than a specific character; she overcomes obstacles instantly without internal conflict or doubt. Her motivation is stated as an abstract thesis ("equations for hope") rather than a felt, embodied drive, and she pays no personal cost for her success.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's internal state relies on diagnostic labels ("introverted soul," "shyness") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The epiphany is intellectual and unearned by struggle; the transition from fear of sound to acceptance happens without a visible cost, hesitation, or behavioral resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on prompt labels ("thoughtfully clear," "errant legend seeker") rather than demonstrated traits. Elias lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion; his "burning motivation" is stated directly rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "serene upheaval" feeling is asserted repeatedly but never felt as a human reaction to the events.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias is a consistent archetype of the "wise sage," but he lacks internal contradiction or struggle. He succeeds at every turn with "infinite patience," which reduces him to a functional vehicle for the theme rather than a living character. The "pact" at the end feels inevitable rather than earned by a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices; Elias acts as a passive vessel for the "healing" theme rather than an agent navigating conflict. The emotional arc is smooth and linear, lacking the internal friction or behavioral contradiction required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.0)
    Motivation to "reawaken beauty" is clear and drives the scene, but interiority relies heavily on the repetitive tag "hypothesizing" rather than embodied feeling. Emotional reactions are described with strained metaphors ("tears quaking") that distance the reader rather than creating genuine affect.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("unyielding compassion," "poised vigilance") rather than dramatized choice. The protagonist’s internal state is summarized via abstract metaphors ("scars... singing") instead of embodied reaction to pressure. Motivation is declared explicitly rather than emerging from friction.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is defined by oxymoronic labels ("luminous skeptic") that never create friction in scene; she accepts the magical premise immediately, negating her skepticism. Her "inner glow" functions as an unearned superpower rather than a character trait, and her motivation remains abstract with no personal stake in the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elowen’s motivation is clearly stated, but she operates more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character; her emotions are often labeled ("sentimentality swelled," "sorrowed her") rather than dramatized through embodied reaction. The internal conflict is present but abstract, lacking the visceral texture of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist acts as a passive vessel for the theme, obeying instructions from specters rather than driving the narrative through agency or difficult choices. The trait "fiercely meditative" functions as a repetitive label (inserted four times) rather than a dramatized internal state or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is asserted through labels ("ethically diligent heart") rather than dramatized through complex internal struggle or active choice. The emotional arc resolves via external magical validation (visions) rather than protagonist agency, leaving the redemption feeling unearned and the internal state somewhat performative.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle; his persistent "blithe" demeanor, even when confronting "uncharted echoes" of murder and betrayal, creates a jarring emotional disconnect. He functions as a passive vessel for the prompt's requirements rather than a character making hard choices under pressure. The lack of psychological cost makes his final "contented sigh" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a competent protagonist with clear motivation, but he functions more as an archetype than a deeply nuanced individual. While his professional drive is well-drawn, his internal conflict is brief and resolved largely through assertion rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara serves as a functional vessel for the premise rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict. While her motivation is clear ("yearned to speak"), her success is immediate and lacks a visible, felt cost; the "thistled calm" she maintains prevents any dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse from complicating her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a compelling, specific protagonist with a distinct motivation ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") that drives the ritualistic plot. His internal conflict—acknowledging the "mirage" while perpetuating it—adds necessary depth to the archetype. The transition from the intense ritual to the resignation of "perpetuating the weave" shows strong character consistency under pressure. (Score capped by Q7 artifact debt).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but interiority relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("rationally rebellious," "agonized") rather than embodied struggle. The character feels constructed to house the prompt terms, resulting in a static emotional baseline despite the stated "agony."

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on archetypal labels (militiaman, merchant, scholar) rather than specific, embodied personality. The transformation of the group is summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices, making the emotional arc feel unearned. Joren's resistance "cracking like dry leaves" is a metaphor that replaces necessary psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer with a clear goal, but his "informally wise" persona relies on caricature ("bad stew") rather than earned depth. He faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice; his righteousness is absolute, and he encounters no moment where his competence is truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation burned steady: to preserve wonder") rather than dramatized through struggle, creating a "telling" issue. The protagonist's internal conflict is resolved somewhat conveniently by a prop (the box) rather than a difficult behavioral choice under pressure. While the curse is a strong constraint, the interpersonal friction with Mira dissolves too quickly to test Elias's resolve deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elias functions as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal contradiction, embodied emotion, or distinct flaws. His motivation is stated ("burning need") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or hesitation. The "noticer" label feels like a role assignment rather than a personality, and he faces no personal cost for his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is largely passive, serving as a receptacle for the statue's exposition rather than an active agent. Her emotional shift from rage to resolve is driven by watching telepathic visions rather than through internal struggle or high-stakes choice. The transformation feels summarized ("resolve cracked," "nuance flooded") rather than earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is legible but relies heavily on repetitive diagnostic labels ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") rather than demonstrated behavior. The character's internal state is articulated through abstract summary ("texture of missed opportunities") rather than embodied reaction, distancing the reader from the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("to prove strangers remember kindness"), but the emotional arc relies on a convenient external validation rather than an earned internal shift. The trait "methodically hopeful" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through a costly choice in the face of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions as a competent guide, but her motivation is stated directly ("burned fierce") rather than dramatized through complex internal struggle. Her leadership is clear, but she feels defined by the labels assigned to her rather than by organic character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation to defy fate is clear and drives the plot, but characterization relies heavily on repetitive diagnostic labels ("bleak exhilaration," "neatly inventive") rather than embodied emotion or behavior. The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the prompt rather than a realized individual, with interiority summarized through abstract backstory rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is explicitly stated ("to trick Fear") rather than felt through organic interiority, reading like a quest objective. While the "suicide" confession offers a glimpse of depth, her emotional state is largely conveyed through adjectives like "repulsive" and "bioluminescent" rather than embodied reaction. The character feels like a vehicle for the prompt's required interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist functions as a competent avatar rather than a conflicted individual; his motivation is explicitly stated ("Elowen’s motivation burned deep") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. While his actions align with the premise, he lacks internal cost or doubt, grinning "fiercely" at mortal peril, which flattens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s agency and obsession clearly drive the narrative toward its tragic conclusion, creating a strong character arc. However, the specific attribute "quietly driven" is applied as a verbatim label twice rather than being fully metabolized into behavior, which slightly flattens the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "emotionally rational" rather than demonstrating the trait through complex choices or embodied interiority. The protagonist's connection to the grandfather is a convenient backstory insertion that fails to generate genuine internal conflict or felt cost. Responses to high-stakes discoveries are melodramatic and summarized ("rational thrill tempered by sorrow") rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on the tell-label "stoically sensitive," which appears verbatim rather than manifesting through nuanced behavior. The protagonist's motivation ("to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") is declared in exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The discovery of his own ancestral name ("Thorne") in the ruins is a convenient coincidence that forces an unearned emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies almost entirely on the mechanical repetition of prompt labels ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") rather than integrated traits. The emotional arc is dictated by these recurring tags rather than embodied reaction or choice. The protagonist feels like a vehicle for the required phrases rather than a living entity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elar functions more as a vessel for abstract grief metaphors than a living protagonist making pressured choices. His interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("luminous torment," "agony") rather than specific, embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The "crafty" trait is asserted but manifests as a magical ritual that works perfectly on the first try, lacking the friction of genuine competence struggling against limits.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on the static, melodramatic visual of the wedding dress rather than evolving psychological depth. She faces no difficult emotional trade-offs in the scene, executing her task with a competence that precludes vulnerability or growth.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara’s motivation shifts too easily from isolation to camaraderie without sufficient internal resistance or doubt. The Pilgrim functions more as a plot device than a character, defined entirely by his static facial expression and expository dialogue. The emotional resolution feels unearned because the connection faces no interpersonal friction or cost before the magical healing occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly established, and the internal conflict between profit and truth is legible. However, the backstory regarding his mother feels tacked on to force a parallel, lacking the organic integration needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation is explicitly labeled rather than dramatized ("motivation burned to recycle mistakes"). The protagonist's trait ("uncommonly thoughtful") is asserted via narration rather than demonstrated through complex choice, resulting in a flat, functional psychological profile.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is legible, but the characterization relies heavily on tragic tropes (estranged daughter, alcohol) and performed emotion ("grinned... merrily melancholic") rather than embodied reaction. The shift from despair to redemption feels mandated by the prompt rather than earned through character specificity or distinct micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.8)
    Motivation is declared via exposition ("motivation crystallized") rather than emerging from pressure, and Elara acts as a passive prop to be fixed rather than a character. The protagonist's emotional state is labeled repeatedly ("jaded by the wonder") instead of being dramatized through distinct choices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("grief's tempests") and the mechanical repetition of the trait "paradoxically steady" rather than demonstrated behavior. The protagonist's internal struggle is summarized rather than dramatized; her "reluctance" is stated in narration but instantly overcome by convenient action without genuine hesitation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirien’s physical state—post-partum exhaustion and "violent rupture"—is grounded and visceral, providing a strong anchor for her motivation. However, her internal journey relies heavily on summarized emotion ("regrets," "repentance") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The transition from despair to grace feels externally granted by the magical mechanism rather than earned through a difficult character decision.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's internal arc is resolved through summary ("Hours blurred") rather than dramatized struggle. Emotions are labeled ("guilt," "envy," "happiness surged") rather than embodied, and the "shadow" antagonist is defeated instantly by her default setting without forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the plot rather than an active agent; his defining moment—the release of the bugs—is explicitly accidental, stripping him of agency at the climax. His motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") is abstract and summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices or felt cost. The "destitute philanthropist" persona feels romanticized and lacks the gritty, contradictory interiority required for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara lacks genuine internal conflict or flaws; her success is never in doubt, making her feel more like a plot device than a character. The trait "calmly inventive" is applied as a static label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure. Her emotional state is described in stock phrases ("soft inward smile," "heart steady") without visceral embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a dynamic agent; his primary action is a procedural ritual that proceeds linearly despite stated doubts. The "precognitively cursed gift" is defined by abstract labels rather than dramatized through difficult, specific trade-offs or behavioral quirks. The resolution feels like a magical healing of his internal state rather than an earned character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined by high-concept labels ("censored poet," "silenced navigator") rather than believable psychology or agency. His emotions are told via oxymorons ("furiously tranquil") and abstract summaries ("storm-kissed wonder") rather than dramatized through distinct micro-choices or embodied reactions. The interiority feels performed for the reader rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation relies on abstract slogans ("turn questions into destinations") rather than felt desire. The pivot from mortal rivalry to alliance is unearned, lacking the necessary emotional friction or gradual trust-building to make the character's choice credible.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined by the "monthly molt" label rather than genuine psychological depth; the shift from architect to organizer feels mechanical. His motivation is declared in dialogue rather than earned through struggle, and the lack of visible internal cost makes the character arc feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined by adjectives rather than internal complexity; his motivation is clear but static. The transition from mourning pianist to "tactician" feels abrupt and exists primarily to satisfy prompt keywords ("strategically creative"). The emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("steely longing") rather than demonstrated behavior or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her "doubt" and "defiance" are stated as labels rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or internalized struggle. While her motivation is clear, she faces no genuine crisis of competence or values, executing the solution without error or meaningful hesitation. The trait "empirically whimsical" is applied to her as a descriptor but does not manifest in contradictory or complex behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on adjectival labeling ("heart severed," "raw as salt spray") rather than embodied behavior or choice. Hiroshi is a stock "mystic advisor" trope without individual agency or distinct personality. Elara’s internal state is described through heavy metaphor, distancing the reader from genuine emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation rooted in neutron star philosophy drives concrete micro-choices like dusting leaves and data, earning her humbled change with felt cost in ambition stripped; interiority concrete via waveform analogies. Minor slips in over-articulated epiphanies like "truth emerges in patience" don't undermine pivotal spectrometer success.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's steadily adaptive trait and motivation to find purpose in pauses drive concrete micro-choices like aligning ledger with frost and shattering globes, with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, aching body). Internal conflict emerges in seeing her life reflected in smugglers' doubts, earning her guardian shift. Minor slip: epiphany on pauses feels slightly over-articulated without deeper contradiction in peak survival beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her scientific eye reads decay as data—and her renunciation of “theatrics” for patient pattern-making is earned through iterative micro-choices with visible cost (stripped graphs, abandoned greenhouse). Contradictory impulses (grief vs. scientific hunger) coexist inside single beats. The only flaw is a late slide into diagnostic abstraction (“kindled humility etched in her soul”) that momentarily labels rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Steadily adaptive” is dramatized in the kiln-dodge and frost-tracking beats; contradiction between survivor’s caution and aesthetic hunger is felt, not named. Final renunciation—melting the ledger into art—pays a clear opportunity cost (evidence lost). Interiority is concrete (“her breath a faint mist… fingers trembled”), never diagnostic. Minor slip: ledger’s earlier emotional weight summarized more than shown in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory layers—grief-scarred survivor, tender tuner of others’ pain—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (palming glass, selecting forks, kneeling to Kai). The interior split between her need to heal and her fear of shattering the haven is active in every beat; the final visible cost—her own heat-map stilled to “serene waves of creation”—pays the price of perpetual service. No diagnostic speak, no tidy arcs; flaws complicate and are accepted, not cured. Only the Kai pivot feels slightly accelerated—his shift from scarlet to teal reads more symbolic than psychally earned—holding this back from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s oppressive fatigue and his craving for “eternal quiet” are viscerally embodied in every prism placement; his calloused finger on jagged glass is character-specific texture. The lens-riddle turns his stoic endurance into active, costly invention—he trades breath, flesh, and finally mortality for silence, so the final fusion with light feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic jargon; even “weariness” is shown via micro-choices—ignoring lung-fire, jamming shards into dry crevices that shouldn’t exist. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is single-track rather than psychologically torn, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s “gently persistent” conviction is dramatized through repeated midnight runs and the bell-ringing climax, so her motive scales visibly. Interiority stays light—more label (“forgotten hope”) than embodied contradiction—but actions track cleanly with ethos. Tomas’s gruff-to-soft turn is credible because the anonymous gift economy pressures him on-page. No deep flaw complicates Mira, yet her endurance costs are legible in the final bell peal, satisfying short-form arc.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—monk-collector vs. healer—is shown through tactile micro-choices (mounting the tear, syncing breath), not labels. Mira remains an archetypal wounded conduit; her only autonomous beat is the final whisper, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin. Elias’s shift from hoarding to carrying love is legible, but the cost is poetic rather than embodied—no forfeiture of the camera, tear, or identity. Still, the camera-wound-breath triad keeps motives coherent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with “time’s texture” is palpable in every tactile gesture; the retrocognitive assaults are embodied, not labeled. Yet the interior contradiction—desire to grasp time vs. paralysis by memory—stops short of altering present tactics until the final beat; we see no micro-choice that risks anything before the halo fragment is pressed to the photograph. The earned cost arrives only at disintegration, so the arc feels back-loaded. Still, the quaking skin and crumbling photos make the stakes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive to sow seeds is stated early and never contradicted, but interior contradiction is thin; we hear “patiently strategic” three times rather than see clashing impulses. The embodied emotion is strongest when she snaps the chain against the nail—one sharp physical cost that crystallizes her finesse. No credible misstep or blind spot complicates her escape, so the liberation feels competent rather than crucible-forged. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (vault first, fight second) is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is visceral—scarred fingers, mitotic fire, the snap of trust crystallizing—yet the line “trust breaking wasn’t a scream but a cessation” drifts into analytical label-speak at the exact beat where embodied cost should dominate. The micro-choice to bottle his own memory-silence is earned, but the partner’s betrayal is recalled more than dramatized, softening the contradiction that might have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“quietly burned,” “mist through crowds,” “ear against canvas”—and her micro-choices (tilting the jar, pressing ear) embody the savvy trait. The turn from thief to listener is earned by the bouquet code, moonbeam jar, and glyph reveal. Cost is felt: she boards alone, clutching jar and canvas, path foreclosed. Missing: secondary character crucible, but single-POV design absolves that; still, a hairline slip from perfect interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s thaw-from-isolation arc is legible and embodied in the furnace ritual, but the interiority is delivered in the same mock-epic register as his speech, flattening private contradiction. The bookmark functions as talisman yet never tests or complicates his choices; it’s a prop rather than pressure. No micro-choice under threat visibly costs him anything, so the final “vow” feels foregone, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s terror-heights-drowning triad is embodied (trembling palms, pulse in ears) and directly drives her decision to weaponise Harlan’s thalassophobia. The “perfect double” contradiction—stunt precision vs. internal collapse—remains active in-scene, culminating in the cliff-edge gambit. Micro-choices (kneeling amid tomes, smearing rust-dust) externalise value hierarchy without diagnostic speak. Only slight over-crank: “certainty that one slip would claim her fragile existence” edges toward label summarisation amid high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The oracle’s quiet monomania is credibly embodied; his “mild obsession” surfaces in tactile micro-choices—closing the booklet with deliberate care, sketching lines pulled from silence. Elara’s desperation is shown through sodden cloak and ragged breath rather than labels. Their final shared stance—map fragment clutched against night—earns a credible endurance with felt cost. Interior contradiction could be sharper: we hear his obsession but never sense a flicker of doubt that might complicate the map-making.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Janitor’s quest for the origin of thought is explicit, consistent, and drives every sweep; the “remarkably composed” trait surfaces only as label, never tested by overload or choice, so the interior contradiction never ignites. No second character means no crucible; the arc is a solo ascension, credibly earned through recursive labor. The final stance—thoughts as companions—lands as Charged Poise with cost: the violin sublimates, taking the loops’ magic with it. Voice stays metallic and reticent, a plus, but emotional granularity is deliberately flat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s quiet vigil and single consequential act—placing the tickets—are micro-choices that scale to the stake. Mira’s thaw is shown through bodily gesture (palm pressed to crystal) rather than label-speak, earning the shift. Interior contradiction is light: Elias desires transparency yet eavesdrops, but the text never forces him to pay for that hypocrisy on the page. The relationship-as-crucible works, yet the cost is felt more by Mira than by Elias, muting full catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his bark-dry skin, “pragmatic rasp,” and refusal to genuflect to scanners mark him as individual. His micro-choices (sweeping circles, binding vines, selecting the most-shattered marble) dramatize a hierarchy of values that culminates in the visible cost of a 1.9 orb he never upgrades. The contradiction between empirical failure and lived success is held in scene, not summary. Secondary auditors exist only as status foils; relationship pressure is therefore thin, capping this at 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—obliging mechanic vs. obsessed theorist—shows in every micro-choice (welding drones while embedding nexus schematics). The mechanically warm touch embodies her split vocation/obsession, and the final lever pull is earned by cycles of clandestine labor. Dr. Lirren supplies sharp status pressure, but his skepticism never complicates her stance; the relationship stays static. The closure costs are conceptual, not personal, so the emotional price feels oblique, capping the arc just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s obsession is palpable in embodied micro-choices—trembling bow, wet fingers coaxing the page—but the great-aunt’s suicide and “feverish dreams” are handed to us in summary, not dramatized contradiction. The final resolve to perform the aria is earned by the water-damage reveal, yet the interior cost feels slightly under-cooked: we see him clutch the score, not feel the forfeiture of his former life. Still, the hierarchy of values (legacy > safety) is legible and stakes scale to length.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s fevered clarity and peripheral awareness are vividly embodied; the swallowed berry and smudged illustration function as concrete extensions of her interior contradiction. Her final slump and acceptance land as credible endurance with felt cost. Yet her “fault-tolerant” trait is asserted more than dramatized in choices—no clear moment where that resilience bends and almost breaks—so the arc stops just short of full earning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jax’s reckless-explorer tag is vivid in the tunnel’s tactile beats, but the pivotal guilt-turn hinges on an off-panel twenty-year-old act never dramatized; the radio-self-confession is clever yet feels externally engineered rather than internally wrung. Interiority is concrete (“dust phantoms brushed his skin”) yet the brother-death link is asserted, not embodied under pressure. Stakes pivot on sabotage admission, but the micro-choice to turn the valve is freighted more by symbolism than by prior-scene-cultivated compulsion. Earned stasis lands, but cost is abstract (“lighter”) rather than physically or relationally paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s motive—witness without judgment—remains abstract; it shapes attention but never crystallizes into a visible cost or contradiction under pressure. Interiority is atmospheric (“gripped reality loosely”) rather than embodied; no moment of fracture or micro-choice is dramatized. The ending’s “unyielding watch” is credible endurance, yet the absence of a tested flaw or sacrificed option keeps the arc cool, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-linked desire to spark wonder in Lila is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every beat; the locket hand-off is a credible, costly renunciation. Lila’s silence-to-whisper arc is embodied, not diagnosed. The only slack: “softly adaptive” recycles as character tag rather than forcing a visible tactical shift under eclipse pressure, muting interior contradiction at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thorne’s lone, obsessive ear-to-wall stance is embodied in every paragraph; his interiority (“gasped… the walls hummed”) is concrete, particular, and contradictory—he both fears the void and feeds on it. The final renunciation—mounting the tapestry and settling into dreamless stone—pays off the diaries’ foreshadowing with visible cost: he forfeits escape. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the micro-choice to display, not burn, the fragment crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. 9+ gate met: contradictory impulses in-scene and earned refusal with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulse—yearning to escape yet clinging to enigma—surfaces only in summary; no embodied beat shows him torn while acting. The pivot from observer to “shadow puppeteer” is declared, not dramatized with micro-choices under stress. Final cost is social applause, not private loss, so the key-change feels gift-wrapped rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied ritual—loop-pedal clicks, palette strokes—showing a man who weaponizes silence itself. His motivation stays legible: expose the shadow’s false premise that stillness equals fragility. No contradictory impulses appear on-page; the priest is monolithic resolve, so the “internal conflict” bullet remains empty. The ending’s earned stasis—palette empty, anchor rewoven—pays the cost, but we never sense he might fail; that safety caps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “chronological homesickness” is a vivid, embodied ache that drives every action; the nautilus shell is handled in three distinct beats, each etching memory into spiral grooves that visibly alter her tactics. Interior contradiction appears only once—she both longs for and conducts her past—yet the final collapse carries earned cost: exhaustion forecloses any return to mere writing. Micro-choices (kneeling, lifting the shell as baton) crystallize her hierarchy of values, though the boy’s single whispered line is too slight to act as crucible. The arc lands in Charged Poise: she becomes conductor at the price of bodily collapse, chronologically homesick no more.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s hunger to “conquer the labyrinth of self” is vivid and under constant test; every timeline he re-enters forces a micro-choice (accept tyranny, solitude, fear, etc.) that exposes contradictions in his identity. The embodied cost—absorbing the shadow-self on the viaduct—reifies the interior split and lands as earned renunciation. Interiority rarely slips into label-speak; instead, memory corridors, mirror-minotaurs and gravity phasing externalize the psyche. Only a hairline slip: the beat-by-beat emotional layering thins slightly during the procedural-description stretch, keeping it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to feel while doubting she can—stays embodied through tactile micro-choices (crimping cavern wire, guiding Thorne’s palm). The climactic self-healing is foreshadowed by her earlier refusal to quit the broken needle; the cost is the exposed vulnerability of conducting communal tears. Status shift with Thorne is cleanly staged: she becomes the leader of a rite, visibly shaking him out of grief-stasis. Voice remains consistent: her deafness filters every observation through vibration, never abstracted into “I feel sad” labels.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s trait-driven choices (encoding intuition into a new journal, releasing the splinted pigeon) crystallize her identity under pressure; the “lateral progression” mechanic is shown rather than told. Interiority is specific to her metrological mindset, though a few stock phrasings (“panic served no data point”) slightly dull the edge. The final renunciation—no report yet—carries visible cost, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s wistful, scent-avoidant interiority is concrete (silk scarf, trembling uncorking). The contradictory drive—grief repulsion vs. ache to inhale—powers every beat, culminating in knees buckling then voluntary deep inhale: earned reversal with visible cost. No second character onstage, so relationship/status bullets skipped; micro-choices (light angle, vial reveal) steadily expose hierarchy of values. Closure renunciation (“aromatically cautious anew”) is legible cost, though slight diagnostic tint in “motivation crystallizing” nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—playful defiance versus yearning for anchorage—animates every beat; the rope-handling knots embody the tension. The final fusion renunciation is earned because the rope has carried his prison-born identity from line 1. Micro-choices (kneeling, whispering verse, wrist-wrapping) stage a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Flaws complicate rather than decorate; no diagnostic self-talk; embodiment stays sensory, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lir’s interiority is vivid—“acoustically perceptive” is shown through the bowed hulls and slivers-of-sound ritual rather than told. His reckless empathic listening is a believable flaw that costs him the safety of silence and forces a public offering of his own unfinished memory at climax. The shift from collector to catalyst is legible; the price (exposure of private grief) is felt. Secondary survivors are sketched with defining fragments rather than full arcs, acceptable at length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s “affectionate detachment” is vividly dramatized in the static-charged petal beat; Mira’s agency is mostly reactive, so the full-change cost lands on Elias yet feels slightly predetermined rather than freshly wrenched. Interior contradiction flashes, but the climactic subsuming beat is narrated more than embodied. Still, the pair’s status dance under pressure is crisp and the final pocketed petal image crystallizes his earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s shrewd-broker trait stays ornamental; the single decisive act—offering weekly star-lit talks—feels expedient rather than wrested from contradictory impulse. Mira’s reclusive widow sketch never compresses under pressure; her “compassion cycles unseen” mantra is asserted, not friction-tested. Interiority drifts into tag-lines (“cycles begin with one kindness”) instead of embodied contradiction. Earned cost is displaced onto the trinket, not the psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s longing for community is vivid and embodied in her reed-sculpting hands; her “boldly sympathetic” trait drives her to clasp Lir’s hand and later to speak the dedicatory words, so motive does convert to visible choice. Interiority stays concrete (“callused,” “luminescent ache,” “frost-kissed branches”) without label-speak. The final renunciation of solitude is earned: she kneels, weaves, speaks—an on-page cost paid. Secondary characters remain lightly sketched but apply immediate social pressure, satisfying the crucible test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s obsession with illustrating the Echo Cradle is explicit, but her interiority stays at mission-statement level (“her motivation burned”). No contradictory impulse or embodied emotion under pressure; she never doubts, fears, or revises her goal. The pendant’s time-borrowing is external magic rather than a trait-driven choice, so the final triumph feels granted, not earned. No visible cost to her person—she simply seals the book and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“his breath steadied; ambiguous loss had fractured him”) yet remains convincingly conjurer-specific. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, slot) flow from the revealed motive and visibly dovetail memory to mystery. No contradiction or therapy-speak; flaws (obsessive calculation, secrecy) complicate the final stance. Cost is felt: empty pouch, pulsing stone, onward step—renunciation of certainty earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “become visible” vow anchors every micro-choice; the tape fragment find triggers embodied grief that immediately tilts his present tactic. The kindly-methodical trait is shown, not labeled—his calloused hands peel insulation “patient as prayer,” then place the wax-papered relic with a scavenged needle. Interior contradiction is alive: he trembles yet smiles, wiping rust on sleeve while steeling to step into the beam. Final emergence costs him the very invisibility that once kept him safe; the embrace crystallizes a hierarchy of values (consolation > shelter) earned by the preceding causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist’s detachment vs. craving fusion—remains concrete through embodied prickling, rooting, bark-mosaic torso. The “circuitously sincere” refrain dramatizes self-negotiation rather than label-speak. Final renunciation is earned: memories of lost wife + nursery legacy visibly shear away as leaves unfurl. Hybrid form is the costly, irreversible stance; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s insomnia and “wryly earnest” voice are vivid in early strokes, but his pivot to relinquish the brooch feels one-note—more declared (“mock the lesson”) than dramatized through contradiction. The exchange with Mira lands as label-based partnership; we’re told their fates converge yet see no status jolt or micro-choice that actually alters Elias’s tactics. Interiority is concrete (“eyes ringed with perpetual shadows”), but peak beat relies on thematic declaration, not embodied cost. Still, an earned renunciation line is present, keeping it in high-band vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thorne’s farmer-grief and Elara’s fatalism are sketched quickly and embodied in gesture (staggering, clutching the pearl). The final surrender is credibly motivated by her prior “curious blind spot,” so the cost is felt. Relationship pressure is thin—only one reactive beat of help—but the single POV default holds. Interiority avoids label-speak; tension between desire and dread stays physical.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s obsession with hidden routes is vivid, but interiority slips into label-speak (“trembling certainty” repeated) and the final turn from mapper to archivist is declared, not dramatized with contradictory impulse on the page. The punch-as-ticket acts, yet the emotional cost of abandoning surface life is only asserted in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” trait is credibly embodied—she offers tea while doubting myths, then lets the tile crack her doubt. Interior contradiction is alive when she vows to transcribe “not for proof, but…”—a renunciation of her former stance with visible cost. Mother’s memories arrive via concrete cue (tile warmth) and tilt her present choice. Minor flattening: late beats summarize “entangled memories” rather than dramatize her visceral struggle to align numbers with whale-paths, so the final cost is felt but not gut-punch-strong.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elowen’s boredom-to-curiosity pivot is asserted rather than dramatized; the fragment’s touch ignites dimension-sight, yet we never feel the internal fracture or contradictory impulse. His choice to accelerate the mutiny is a single smooth escalation without visible cost or renunciation, so the “earned” test remains unmet. Interiority leans on lyric declaration (“immortal boredom transmuting to electric hunger”) rather than body-level contradiction. Still, the voice stays consistent and the stakes are personal, keeping the portrait above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s drive for “the mathematics of a fair trade” is concrete, embodied, and steers every micro-choice; the internal contradiction between honest instinct and con-artist heritage is dramatized in-scene. The ink-vapor beat liquefies scruple on the page, forcing a visible shift in tactics. Final escape success feels earned because earlier timing equations are practiced under pressure. Cost is present but compressed; a hair more embodied consequence at the breach would lift to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thorne’s quiet obsession with “textures of different times” is palpable in his stylus-work and gold-leaf breath-control, giving us a concrete, embodied motive. Interior contradiction surfaces when the lamp’s hum drags him from safe invention toward the town’s real frost-death; his refusal to flee charges the Earned Stasis closure. Micro-choices—etching orchid ink, binding the final volume—show value hierarchies under pressure. Yet the townspeople remain off-screen, so relationship crucible and status dynamics can’t engage; the 7.3 reflects strong single-POV interiority without full-scope characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured—“bitter almonds on tongue,” “tide-eroded shore”—and the final micro-choice to clutch the label crystallizes identity. Motivation stays steady but never sharpens into a higher-stakes fork; the wanderer only accumulates, never gambles. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc feels like steady revelation rather than pressured character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—skeptic who crafts talismans—survives the text; the cello/seashell dyad externalizes it. The “gloomy cheerfulness” tag is embodied in the laugh amid ruin, paying a visible cost (shell paint flakes, compass spent). Micro-choices (aligning shell to f-hole, bow dancing faster) escalate with stakes. Motive stays constant but not static—each retelling tightens the noose of self-made meaning. The ending’s renunciation (myths cherished because busted) is earned by the causal chain of hums; still, the absence of any second character limits relational crucible and caps the score short of 8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “orderly intuitive” label is repeated but never dramatized as a visible cognitive mechanism; the stone chip functions as lucky talisman rather than revealed flaw. Interior contradiction is asserted (“dual allegiance tore at her”) instead of acted out in a single beat where grid-loyalty actually collides with carnival-loyalty. The closing smile feels unearned because no micro-choice shows her paying a specific, irreversible cost—rafts re-lash, but she sacrifices nothing on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the risky climb and the meticulous photo setup; the interior contradiction between scientific awe and personal mortality is felt in the oxygen countdown. The final endurance costs him time and risk, earning his quiet triumph. Voice leaks into generic “space-age twilight” abstraction once, blunting the full 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—the need to decode the drone’s “story” versus the ticking anchor-chain clock—are dramatized in tactile beats; his blindness is never gimmick, forcing apprentices to become his eyes. The final smile is credible renunciation: he accepts perpetual depot vigil while the drone sails. Cost is felt. Minor slip: apprentices blur into one choral voice, trimming individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harlan’s obsession and dry wit stay sharp throughout; the interior contradiction between cartographic certainty and mythic longing is alive in every micro-choice. His body reacts—pulse quickening, freeze on the glass—without therapeutic gloss. The falcon and phrasebook function as extensions of his will, so the “relationship” pressure is off-stage; still, the final stride into the white is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Flaw: “subtly confident” is asserted more than tested; no beat lets us watch confidence nearly break.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “infinitely patient” label is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a moment where impatience threatens; the fork is handled, yet no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates his use of it. Interiority stays atmospheric (“burned deep”) rather than embodied or contradictory, so the promised internal hierarchy of values feels declared, not dramatized. Because the closure beat awards him serene success without cost, the arc leans parable-flat, not character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirael’s desire to “harness the ephemeral” is stated early and anchors every beat; memories surfaced by the vial directly feed her steady-handed unsnarling, so motive⇔action linkage is tight. Interiority stays concrete—air gauge, gloved fingers, pounding heart—though a few phrases (“serene resolve,” “eternal quietude”) flirt with label-speak. The final endurance costs her remaining air, making the choice irreversible; the ancestry angle, however, is asserted more than dramatized, muting flaw complexity. Still, her contradictory fear/awe under crushing depth reads individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s contradictory mix of filial loyalty and homicidal resolve is embodied on the page (“bare feet… each step a whisper,” “lattice scraping softly”). His lineage shame and calculated poisonings push him to escalating risk, but we learn too little about how the father’s warnings were ignored (only one summary line) to feel the full weight of vendetta. Interiority poises between chilling purpose and ghost-anchored grief; the moment he tells the hovering patriarch “You cried wolf once too often” crystallizes a son seizing authorship of the family myth. Cost is legible—he forfeits innocence and societal safety—but the stakes tilt toward abstract vindication rather than a tangible future consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s regret and hunger for transcendence stay vivid; each micro-choice (eating the pear, clutching the bead) is tied to visceral sensation. The ghost bride’s motivation is legible—repayment of cross-lifetime debt—yet her agency is mostly off-stage, so the relational crucible test fires only at the end. Internal contradiction is handled through euphoria/pain duality rather than alternating labels. Closure renunciation (his death/merging) is earned by the pattern of prior ingestions and visions, so the cap for unmotivated choice is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “hauntingly optimistic” trait is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through contradiction or cost; she sleepwalk-sews without internal resistance, so the optimism feels decorative. The heirloom plate motivates entry but her interiority stays generic (“verses whispered to the waves”). No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure; the trance erases active decision-making, flattening potential flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s exile-and-return motive is clear, but interiority floats in atmospheric paraphrase (“faith flickered,” “yearned to restore”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (digging, fitting root-gnomon) are present yet feel instructional, not charged; no moment forces her to risk or relinquish anything visible. The rebuilt sundial is catharsis-by-implication only; cost is atmospheric, not embodied. Voice is consistent, but emotion stays at scenic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to “find truth in margins” is embodied through tactile micro-choices: chalking star-coordinates, rotating the grid 47°, sealing wax. One contradiction—she claims chalk is “innocent” yet instantly weaponizes it—could use a flicker of regret to deepen flaw. The clipboard never changes her tactics; still, her embodied urgency and chalk-smeared fingers sell the obsession. Closure earns its hush: the heart she chalks for luck is the only personal margin she gets to keep.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory performance—dotty babble vs. steel-trap chart correction—plays out in continuous, embodied beats (thumb-prick, pulse-stitch, tea-spill) that cost her blood, time, and personal safety. Every micro-choice is rooted in the same twin motives: cosmic listening and queen-protection, culminating in the courier beat where her “silly” spill slips the life-saving chart into the satchel. The contradiction is never explained away; instead it sharpens until the final charged poise where she keeps stitching, path foreclosed, candle affirming the price. Voice, perception, and gesture stay singular and idiosyncratic; no competence inflation or moral safety net.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s fierce-tender need to unsay her silence is visceral and embodied; every step is driven by that regret. The shard’s cut on her thigh and the warming moonlight give concrete bodily cost to her interior ache. Interior contradiction is alive—she both clutches pride and begs to renounce it. Only lapse: Thorne’s late-page appearance is sketched more as symbol than as a second full character, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is felt more by her memory than by present negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific; the “lotus-hearted ache” refrains risk label-speak but are earned by embodied gesture (trembling fingers, whispered balm). The brother-loss backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her decryption choices, satisfying BRR. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: feigned playfulness → decryption → unknotting string → pocketing fragment. No contradiction under pressure; the final refusal to sink is credible renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motive—recover lost joy—anchors every beat; embodied emotion (“fingers itched,” “breath catching”) and micro-choice (kneel, lift, paint) keep interiority concrete. Flawed nostalgia vs. present agency gives credible contradiction; final renunciation (pocketing fragment, walking away) pays cost. No relationship crucible here, but network-ghost nod suffices for secondary pressure. Voice remains singular, no diagnostic speak; stays within 8-band for minor over-reliance on ‘pensive mirth’ refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s “methodically playful” trait is shown through paint-chip and coin-tilt micro-choices that visibly cost him control; Lena’s skeptic-armor cracks via embodied pulse-sync rather than label-speak. The final alliance is earned because every coin-reflection beat tightens her stance. Interiority stays concrete, though the triple “awakening” exposition slightly over-articulates what the body has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s defiance is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted (“guarded his spark”) rather than dramatized in a single tough choice. The greenhouse beat with Voss finally shows micro-choice (harvesting the warped fruit) that costs him visibility to the Bureau, earning partial credit. Earlier beats rely on charm as shorthand; we don’t see him weigh fear against rebellion in real time. The arc lands, but the crucial motivational tightening is compressed into one image rather than built beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen’s centuries-long insomnia and alchemical urge to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are vivid, embodied in nacre-scored fingers and trembling postcard handling; the internal contradiction—timid yet unstoppable—surfaces in micro-choices like pressing the card into the alcove. The armistice choice is credibly earned, but the lack of any second on-page character keeps relational/status dynamics idle. Interiority risks poetic self-labeling (“twin abysses reflecting endless starless nights”) that briefly drifts toward diagnostic-speak. Still, the final surrender carries visible cost: the poet’s first sleep forfeits his vigil-voice, an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s remorse over Lirien is the single, concrete engine of every micro-choice; the “foxglove” metaphor is repeatedly embodied (toxic pulse in veins, tears). Interiority stays sensory—“petals unfurled, absorbing names”—never sliding into diagnostic speak. The final kneel amid glowing shards is an earned renunciation whose cost (tube lost, Lirien still gone) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” trait is dramatized through the quill strokes and ritual breaths, but Thorne’s interiority is missing; his sudden softening feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned. Still, her micro-choices (lifting the stopper, capping the well, pocketing the droplet) chain motive to action with visible cost. The silence fracture and trust motive stay legible and personal, satisfying the single-POV default.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and intensifies through the decoded letter, but interiority slips into grand abstract labels (“dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion”) rather than embodied contradiction. The trembling moment is visceral, yet the emotional calculus flattens into tidy communal harmony immediately after. A visible cost is present—ancestral guilt, abandoned dam plan—but the beat is summarized, not dramatized, softening the renunciation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradictory needs—fraudulent myth-making vs. the ache to be known—are palpable in every beat; the moment he steadies the chip on a needle-point while confessing “no alien magic” crystallizes interior conflict into bodily risk. Lila’s presence forces status shifts (naïve admirer → accuser → co-author) that tighten his choices. The final, shared breath-sync while the meteorite hums shows a credible, costly pivot from isolation to joint fragility. Voice convergence at the end is brief and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to close the sacred gap yet fearing its collapse—are dramatized in her finger-tracing of grain and the final hesitation before crossing. The “featherly determined” trait is embodied, not labeled, in her light touch and decisive etching of code into the table. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tactile discovery rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Only the father’s single-word greeting at the end feels slightly undercooked, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing to “learn the rhythm of belonging” is signaled early and threads every beat; her micro-choices—pocketing the feather, mapping starlight on drowned walls, synchronizing breath with Theo—are concrete and particular. Interiority is lyric but never diagnostic, and her flaw (solitary stargazing as shield) is quietly complicated by shared wonder. The cost is the earned renunciation of solitude: the feather passed to Theo crystallizes the shift. Secondary pressure from Theo’s exile is thinly dramatized, keeping the score just below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—glee braided with grief—stays embodied in sea-foam skin and humming dirges; her micro-choice to scatter a seed is the single visible decision that costs her lingering doubt, so the change is earned if modest. The “cheerful gloom” refrain edges toward performed label-speak twice, damping full credibility, but her flaw (path-seeding hesitation) directly shapes the closing image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jasper’s analytical performer persona is vivid—his driftwood chess set, wind-velocity calculations, and covert staging of “random” encounters all externalize a coherent obsession. Elara’s arc from glazed clerk to re-animated artist is sketched via gesture (defensive shoulder angle, bracelet fidget) rather than label-speak, and the micro-choice to approach the tattooed man feels earned. Interior contradiction is light: we never see Jasper doubt his manipulative orchestration, so the promised “genuine struggle” is muted. Still, the pair’s visible cost—Jasper’s self-erasure, Elara’s risk of creative failure—lands with enough sting to satisfy at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—pure art vs mortal longing—stays embodied in tidal posture and heel-on-moonstone shock; the anchoring freezes her mid-dance, dramatizing flaw. Micro-choices (reading star-gaps as syntax) emerge credibly from her dancer’s pattern-hunting instinct. Final renunciation of flight for skin-warmth carries visible cost through dissolved wings, meeting Earned Stasis threshold. Voice drifts toward abstract lyric register under peak pressure, blunting full specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “callused hands tracing fractures” and the “weight of overlooked days” in the pebble embody his vocation and worldview. Contradictory impulses (need to mend vs. dread of coming break) stay active in scene, not summary. Final renunciation—pocketing the glowing shard as talisman—is earned by the pond-side micro-choices and costs him his complacency. Only lacks a second character on-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clutching a fragile box while promising mastery over fire—shows, but his final “enlightenment” of Lena is told more than dramatized; the micro-choice to hand her the box is the single visible pivot. Lena’s agency is largely reactive; her vow reads as thematic echo rather than earned stance. Burn scars and porcelain cracks supply embodied emotion, yet the diagnostic self-summary “I bargained my innocence” flattens the contradiction. Relationship pressure is present but one-sided; Elias does all emotional heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “logical dreamer” stance shows in the fractal shell equations she builds—but the story never lets her doubt or err; the absence of a visible flaw or contradiction keeps her just short of the 8-band where earned cost is required.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s inherited guilt and perceptual gift are vivid, but the pivot from passive reception of echoes to active atonement is declared rather than dramatized; the final vow carries intellectual rather than bodily cost. Interiority is atmospheric yet loops the same note of ancestral dread. No secondary character on page, so relational crucible inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motive—mirrors must show hope after her lover’s despair—gives every beat direction, and the borrowed-heartbeat constraint forces visible micro-choices (kneeling, inhaling threads). Interiority stays concrete (“her chest blooming”) rather than abstract, and the endurance of annual theft earns a felt cost. Flaw: “perceptively calm” is repeated label, not embodied contradiction, keeping her just short of full contradictory life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s centuries of guilt and her need to “anchor ideals in practice” are viscerally embodied in the trembling hand that lights the brazier and the spectral boy who accuses her at the signature moment. The internal war between longing for redemption and knowledge that it can never be complete drives every micro-choice; her palm-blood sealing the accord is a credible, costly renunciation. No stock interiority—her self-interrogation is filtered through marble scars and torch shadows. Flaw: delegates remain types, so relationship crucible is weak; still, her solitary arc earns its stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—corporate predator vs. boy who once wept for a fledgling—are fused in the embodied gesture of cradling the egg; every micro-choice (kneeling, tracing cracks, silent release) is driven by a visible internal civil war. The final renunciation lands with irrefutable cost: he forfeits the last huia and any future claim to redemption, yet walks lighter—an earned paradox that feels inevitable because the text has shown salt cracking under the same emotional fault-lines. Interiority is concrete (“salt salting his cheeks”) rather than diagnostic; sentiment is confessed only through salt-crusted skin. No safety-hedging: his amorality stays live, sentiment stays secret, and the contradiction powers the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s chastity-as-rebellion is compelling but stays abstract; no moment lets us feel the cost of untouched skin while she dances. Her interiority drifts into grand label-speak (“paradox in the Empire of Lullabies”) rather than a specific, body-level contradiction. The final smile is earned, yet the lack of any micro-choice that risks her chastity blunts the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s urbane poise and calligrapher precision are vividly embodied in silk-scarf and finger-detail; the internal contradiction—thrill of control vs. fear of raw truth—is dramatized in the stick-reversal beat. The renunciation carries felt cost: he whispers “half-lit no more” while pocketing the stick, foreclosing the bar circuit. Minor over-articulation of ethical motive (“to probe the razor edge...”) keeps it from 8+. Serenity trait is shown, not labelled, and shapes the final quiet exit.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority pulses with contradiction—grandmother’s dismissed myths vs. iron-oxide data—yet the story keeps her at symbolic arm’s length. The “esoteric realist” label is announced, not dramatized; we see her knot, whisper data-mantras, but never watch her doubt her own occult slide-rule. The final refusal-to-rebuild lands as credible renunciation precisely because the earlier tower collapses under its own transience, paying the cost she half-expected.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s guilt, artisan precision, and thawing resolve braid into every micro-choice; the “technically gentle” trait visibly constrains her handling of the rope and card, and her final weeping endurance carries the earned cost of replaying apprentice-trauma in bronze. Interiority is sensorial, not therapeutic—steam-breath, callus, trembling—so contradictions live in muscle, not labels. The forgiveness backstory is anchored to present tactile cues and alters her stance at the altar. Closure is a renunciation-turned-creation: she accepts the sound-scar she will carry south; path foreclosed with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s blindness to the present is dramatized through tactile interaction with the bunker and dream-pod; the final transcendence is earned by the causal chain of visions. Interiority is vivid (“vines coiling around ghostly figures”) and avoids diagnostic speak. Micro-choices (cracking the seal, reclining into the pod) visibly enact her hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: she seals the hatch knowing she traps future walkers, a renunciation that stings.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ezar’s frugality is more than label: it governs every micro-choice—re-using stylus, saving lamp oil—so motive stays legible. Interior contradiction is thin; once the tile is found, obsession eclipses thrift without showing the strain of that shift. Still, the final renunciation of oil for cosmic sight is earned by prior parsimony. The cost is visible in the single extinguished lamp, a legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s pacifist-schemer contradiction stays live: every beat is a silent calculation that still refuses violence. Thorne’s body-level convulsion when the lullaby vibration hits is a visceral, non-generic surrender. The final exhalation costs Thorne his armor and Elias the next visitor—both pay visibly. Interiority is cellular, not therapeutic; resentment is never named aloud, only tactically unhooked.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief, craft-identity, and stubborn refusal to surrender the dream are embodied in every beat—boots sinking in frost-mud, callused thumbs on brass cracks, lungs timing inhale to ghost-breath. Contradictory impulses (rational skeptic vs. doomed lover) overlap in-scene, not in summary. The final embrace costs him the safety of distance; the boundary he dissolves is his own detachment, paid for by accepting an illusion he knows is illusion. No stock therapeutic labels; interiority stays concrete and idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s gnarled climb and quartz-eye flicker embody a mender whose fear of irrelevance is as tactile as the sap on pews; Lila’s feisty shove and ribbon-tying enact her trait under pressure, not merely label it. The internal contradiction—persistence masking dread—drives every micro-choice up the rafters, and the final retying of the ribbon crystallizes a visible cost: the orchard’s renewal now depends on their shared, fallible tending. Only the daughter’s interiority briefly drifts into generic “wildflower” scent, a hair below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s curiosity, fear, and exultation register through concrete beats—tracing the shell, laughing in the meteor-glass bathroom, demanding answers from a tree. Contradictory impulses (wonder vs. terror) coexist in-scene, not in summary. Final acceptance of recursive self-creation costs her linear identity, but the turn is compressed into one clause (“curator become exhibit”) rather than dramatized; cost is felt yet briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” tag is stated twice but never tested by a scarcity beat; she simply knows or finds. The moment she deciphers the Echo-Lilies is vivid, yet the diary—not her flaw—supplies the answer, so the rescue feels gifted rather than earned. Interiority is atmospheric (“her mind already mapping”) rather than contradictory under pressure. No visible cost attaches to her final step, so the closure choice feels weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive to “weave back” her chimera twin is legible from the first sentence, but interiority is delivered in abstract lyric bursts (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom”) rather than embodied reaction. The micro-choices—draping the card, whispering thread-stories—are present yet feel symbolic rather than risky; no concrete cost (blood, breath, time) is tethered to her acts, so the final renunciation reads as predetermined myth, not earned character rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “adaptable archivist” trait is shown through calm note-taking and methodical cataloguing under anomaly-pressure, but the interior contradiction promised never arrives—she never weighs risk against scholarly duty, so her final choice feels predetermined rather than earned. The embodied emotion is thin: pulse quickens once, then is forgotten; no bodily cost or hesitation stains the climax. Micro-choices (unweaving rope, pressing seal) are meticulously staged yet lack a visible value hierarchy or trade-off; the scene never forces her to sacrifice anything. The result is a competent professional vignette, not a crucible that reveals new limits.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“hammered repose” shows contradiction under pressure; micro-choice of pressing the stone crystallizes cost. Motivation stays steady, but the absence of any second character or relationship crucible limits relational depth. Earned stasis is credible: she forecloses retreat, accepting perpetual vigilance. Still, no flaw compounds choice; competence feels near-perfect, muting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—the shard silences the hum, visions sharpen, palms cool—creating embodied contradiction. The final ascent threads spectral custodians who nod approval, staging micro-choices that escalate cost. Motivation (“prove coincidences have meaning”) stays legible, but the beat where she pivots from doubt to certainty is summarized, not dramatized, muting the decisive internal fracture. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she descends “knowing others might come,” a stance that forecloses isolation with felt, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Archivist’s interiority is sensuously embodied (robes “embroidered with faded quills,” “frost on glass”) and her contradictory impulse—mourning futures before they vanish—drives every micro-choice. The final crystallization of identity costs her the comfort of certainty; that ache is visible. Relationship/status crucible is absent (solo scene), so bullet waived. Voice remains individual, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—playful spinner vs. burdened wanderer—surfaces in the fire-knot twirl and the vow to “light every dusk,” but the shift from defiance to communal hope is asserted rather than embodied; no bodily cost or irreversible forfeiture is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elaron’s “warmly observant” nature is shown through concrete micro-choices—watching Mira’s trembling hands, selecting the cicada, refusing to stare directly—so his trait alters tactics, not just mood. Mira’s interiority is thinner; her shift from despair to recognition is credible but delivered in a single whispered line, so the cost feels compressed. The closure hinges on her acceptance, yet the causal engine is Elaron’s embodied action,满足Q1的9+ test for contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s dread of enclosed spaces and her hunger for open sky drive every move; the contradiction is lived in body (clutching trellis vs. chest tightening in vine cradle). The porcelain doll Mira acts as second skin—she strokes it, fills it, clutches it—so her “archive of silences” is never abstract. Father remains off-page, yet his bunker shadow is felt as live counter-pressure. Final beat: she tastes gilded hush, a sensory cost that makes her refusal of bunkers credible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s calm-operator archetype is vivid, but interior contradiction is only implied; the glass vial stands in for inner weather rather than forcing a visible psychic split. His renunciation of scolding in favor of catalytic silence is credible and scaled to length, yet the cost feels borne more by the passengers than by Elias himself. Micro-choices are present but smoothed into choreography; we never feel him sweat. Still, the vocation-driven motive is specific and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “wisely adventurous” tag is shown more than told: she deciphers the mural riddle instead of fleeing the drones, and her final refusal to seize the throne is earned by earlier interior hesitation. The flake’s warming pulse gives her a concrete, embodied cue for emotion. Minor slip: the phrase “heartbeat from yesteryear” drifts toward stock poeticism, blunting the otherwise sharp interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority is poetically dense but drifts into therapy-speak (“to breathe is to release”) that tells rather than dramatizes; micro-choice at the ring-heating beat is visible, yet contradiction between tender caretaker and ruthless teacher is stated, not embodied under pressure. Cost is implied, not felt; no bodily or behavioral trace shows the price of refusal. Motivation remains abstract; dependency metaphor circulates but never concretely alters tactics once the ring appears.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—scarred by fraud yet mischievously benevolent—are dramatized in his choice to twist the bolt, turning personal shame into communal alchemy. The embodied smirk, pocketing of the humming bolt, and final outbound texts show consistent micro-choices under pressure. Flaw: “virtuously mischievous” is repeated like a badge rather than re-shown at the climax, slightly diluting interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—his fingertip feel for the crank, the visceral certainty that “the dynasty must end.” The lone flaw: the moment he crystallizes that resolve is slightly over-articulated (“truth’s guardian unbound”), nudging toward label-speak that dulls the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s silence-turned-legend ache is concrete; his trembling gloved hand and kneeling posture embody the withdrawn knight stereotype without cliché. The interior contradiction—craving agency yet fearing regret—drives every beat, culminating in the earned cost when the thread coils and a future of public voice is priced with permanent binding to spectral puppeteers. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (“By string and shade…”) crystallize value hierarchy on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s grief-driven need to “magnify small kindnesses” is anchored early and charges every beat; the discovery of the letter lets her enact that need, turning archive dust into emotional agency. Interiority is concrete (“her pulse quickening,” “vision of Amos pinning the button”) and her micro-choice to polish the button before locking the box crystallizes a visible cost—she now owes the dead soldier a continuation of his quiet heroism. The letter itself supplies the contradiction she must absorb: official erasure versus private devotion, giving her a new, unpaid debt rather than a comforting answer. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays specific and era-true without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s hoarded key and scavenger identity are specific, but interiority slips into grand declarations (“tyranny of indifference”) that feel authorial rather than embodied. His micro-choices (kneeling at water, activating slate) are dramatized and carry visible cost, earning the final smile. The contradicted impulse—stay hidden vs broadcast truth—appears only implicitly; more tension inside him would sharpen the arc. Still, the character’s quiet competence and underdog status feel individual, not stock.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-bound vow and practiced silence are credibly welded; the sister-loss memory and “negative space” tactic show contradictory impulses in play. Micro-choices—reed-whisper inversion of the seer’s code, pauses that swallow prophecy murmurs—pay visible cost in breath and stamina. Final renunciation (lowering sax, stepping away) forecloses both prophecy and full self-healing; the fragile smile acknowledges that cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; only near-miss for 9+ is a hairline slip of abstract phrasing in “vested hush took hold.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lir’s “mossy delight” is repeated so often it becomes a tic, not a trait; the synesthetic emotion never gains new facets under pressure. Interiority is mostly catalogic (“he cataloged it instantly”) rather than internally contradictory. The final stance—stepping into the void with probe and sylph—does foreclose a path, but the cost is asserted (“fading heart”) rather than felt. Still, his seed-sorting precision and folklore hunger remain consistent and particular, keeping characterization above the common ruck.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s “uncertainly certain” interiority is dramatized in micro-choices—using a quartz shard as screwdriver, levering the chest with a hairpin—showing trait-consistent improvisation under pressure. The closing alliance with uncertainty is earned: his laugh and tactical pivot (knotted-root shortcut) visibly shed old rigidity. No contradictory impulses appear simultaneously; reflection is summary, not embodied mid-action. Still, the single on-page cost is light for 700 words, capping the arc just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—guilt over naming her brother against her creed of balance—drives every beat; the golden brushstroke that seals the crucible is a micro-choice that visibly costs her composure and re-balances her craft. Thorne’s emergence is slightly undercooked: he speaks once, offering no new friction, so the relationship crucible cools instead of testing the new equilibrium. Still, her flaw (hubris in naming) directly generates the rescue tactic, satisfying earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s inner contradiction—needing to weaponize mockery to heal—lands only in the final paragraph; until then she is a poised guide, not a conflicted agent under live strain. The pendant’s burn and her sweat are the single embodied cost; we are told “bittersweet burden” rather than shown a specific forfeiture. Micro-choices (tuning, fingering) track cleanly, but no moment forces her to risk failure or question her ethos, so the change feels observed, not earned. Still, her perceptual filter is vivid and consistent, keeping her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—deriving a “mathematics of mercy” from her torment—remains conceptually abstract yet is repeatedly bodied through strap-in-hand and proprioceptive ticks, giving her interiority tactile specificity. Micro-choices (cinching knuckles, looping pewter like an abacus) externalize hierarchy of values under UV duress; the cost is palpable in hyper-extended joints and heart stutter. Final stance—carrying etched equations in flesh—earns its renunciation: further proof would mean re-capture, a path now foreclosed. Flaw: motivation arrives as a thesis statement; incremental emotional layering is compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is richly textured: the lens fragment’s heft vs shimmer mirrors her own liminal identity, and every micro-choice (trading the grave-pebble, whispering “Release the overlooked”) is concrete, costly, and specific to her. Contradictory impulses—longing to anchor vs need to let go—play out inside a single continuous beat, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses her childhood tether. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies because the cost, while felt, is framed as triumphant release rather than visible forfeiture; still, the choice is causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theo’s compulsion to “discover what ceilings hide” is concrete, embodied in the dust-patterns he reads, the ghosts he endures, and the toolkit he wields; interiority stays tactile rather than diagnostic. The final act of lowering bones and pocketing the barrel is a credible renunciation that costs him the continued company of the ghosts, foreclosing his lone ritual. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page—he never hesitates—so the arc is linear, not layered with simultaneous conflict. Still, the observable-to-action pipeline is clean, specific, and scaled to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s hunger to bottle infinity is the only motive that matters; it intensifies through each frost-coded signpost and crystallizes in the final uncorking. Interiority is lean but concrete—his laugh at the climax embodies the cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the arc is linear rather than layered, capping the score below 9. Still, the single-minded obsession lands with visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—mourning his failed revolution while hungering to resurrect it through myth—are active in-scene when he palms the shard and chooses annihilation of evidence over possession. The gesture crystallizes a hierarchy of values (legacy > truth) with visible cost: alarms, pursuit, the scholars’ outrage. Interiority stays concrete (“revolutionary ghosts” trembling in his fingers). One beat of diagnostic label-speak (“his poetically inclined soul”) keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s grief for his daughter is the only motive supplied, and it is stated once rather than lived in scene; interiority is lyric-sentimental (“tinkersong tears”) rather than embodied under pressure. He performs no contradictory impulse; the flower’s un-wilting simply certifies his honesty instead of testing it. The cost—rust flakes away, daughter wakes—arrives as miracle, not as price he visibly pays or chooses. Daughter is off-stage prop, not relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tremble, vials clink, scents guide her—but the “sensibly eccentric” label is asserted more than dramatized. The decisive turn—choosing to pull the hinges and accept communion—carries credible cost, yet the prior psychometry visions feel like summary rather than embodied contradiction. Still, her flaw/obsession directly enables and complicates the climax, earning a solid high-band pass.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority pulses—contradictory awe and humility toward the storm and relic—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices; her final resolve is signaled, not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is dramatized through embodied, painterly perception; her micro-choice to scrape the cathedral glass day after day shows a hierarchy of values (art > comfort) with visible cost (raw fingertips, lantern-lit isolation). Interiority stays concrete—“tender ache in the umbral half-light”—never drifting into label-speak. The final tear-stained stillness is earned by the causal chain of postcard clues and glass unveilings; her decision to paint the lovers’ mural forever renounces daylight acclaim, paying the price of permanent nocturnal vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsessive need to recover erased voices is vivid, but his interiority alternates between lyrical label (“searing pull”) and embodied specificity. The parallel-era possession gives him a crucible, yet the emotional stakes feel externally choreographed by the vision rather than internally earned; the final resolve lands but we don’t feel the cost in body or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s refusal to join the ghosts and his obsessive drive to re-imagine civilization are vividly embodied (“eyes burning with unquenched fire”). Interior contradiction is shown in scene: he both wields and is trapped by the amber bottle, a simultaneous impulse that re-weights the ending. The micro-choice to channel memory-through-bottle rather than rest or break is visible and costs sweat, strain, and isolation. One slip: the “unquenched fire” veers toward stock heroic lens; still, the earned stasis of walking into his own crowd feels credible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—collector vs. participant—are alive in every beat: the trembling finger, the whispered dead vow, the final self-immersion. The loneliness flaw is not declared but embodied in the velvet-cushioned alcove and the withheld sharing. The renunciation of pure archiving is earned because the prophecy makes the cost of detachment audible. One decimal shy of 9.0 only because the interiority edges toward lush summary at “velvet disquiet threaded…like aged wine laced with ash.”

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s drive to “feel the texture of borrowed time” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why risk unraveling the world to taste stolen years?—never crystallizes in scene; the final smile feels tidy rather than costly. Micro-choices (placing seeds, twisting the cap) track motive, yet the emotional stakes stay abstract: we’re told “wild serenity” floods her, not shown what that flooding costs her body or memory. Still, the heirloom-seed identity seeds every beat, and her hand-in-vortex moment is a sensuous, irreversible act that earns the inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’ “favor listening over noise” motive is clear and embodied in the midnight switch decision, but interiority is mostly abstracted (“curiosity gnawed,” “humble resolve”) rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost is present (bell over siren, personal risk) yet feels externally narrated rather than viscerally internalized. No second character on page, so relationship crucible n/a. Microclimate logs are a nice occupational lens but remain a prop, not a lived-in extension of body.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s spiritual ache and trembling vulnerability are embodied through ritual handling of the lantern glass; micro-choice to press forehead to orb externalizes interior cost. Still, his janitorial identity remains symbolically ornamental—no on-page professional constraint shapes tactics. Earned stasis feels slightly undercosted: solitude is confirmed but prior abandonment is summarized, not dramatized, softening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recluse’s “tranquilly perceptive” nature is shown through silent ritual and the way he “reads the wind’s whispers,” giving him a consistent, idiosyncratic lens. His embodied awe—breath caught, eyes widening—grounds the astonishment beat without cliché. The final choice to place the box atop the hive is a micro-action that crystallizes his hierarchy of values: isolation traded for guardianship. Interiority stays concrete; no stock epiphanies, though the covenant backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting contradiction depth.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s borrowed-time status is embodied from the first line and drives every beat: the cracked-canister descent, the shard-to-chest sync, the final broadcast. Contradictory impulses—grief for Lira vs need to sell “timeless fragments”—collide on the page, not in summary. His heart literally skips to the shard’s hush, a micro-choice that forecloses passive mourning and turns him into weaver; cost is the forever-loss of true chronology. Interiority stays concrete (“time’s grit between moments”), never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is consistently concrete—tracing the feather’s barbs, wading ankle-deep, improvising stanzas aloud—so his obsession with “woven dawns” feels lived-in rather than declared. The final low-hover launch is a credible renunciation (shorter string, visible asymmetry) that pays the cost of perfectionism without therapy-speak. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy: he forfeits dry comfort and pristine paper to keep the flawed kite aloft. Still, the emotional contradiction inside the pivotal beat (loss→anticipation) is asserted more than dramatized, capping the score just below exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “gently systematic” trait is embodied in wire-wrapping beats and diary sketches, but interior contradiction is thin; no moment shows him tempted to abandon or doubt. His calm under death-sentence is asserted, not dramatized; we see no visible cost in stamina or emotion until the final sink-against-oak, too late to test character. Closure is Earned Stasis, yet the price feels atmospheric rather than personal; the diary’s open pages flutter, not his body. Competence balanced with struggle is missing; work proceeds without error or adaptation, flattening credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “luminous skepticism” is vividly embodied in her illicit scans and self-exiled trek; contradictory impulses—yearning vs. doubt—pulse in the same beats. The final renunciation of committee-truths feels earned because her earlier micro-choices (hacking feeds, pocketing formulas) foreclose a safe academic return. Cost is visible: she steps onto a path “theirs alone,” trading tenure for uncertain orbit. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thorne’s grief-forged vocation and quiet defiance are embodied in every motion; the coat-pocket pods and Eldari whispers make his interiority singular. The micro-choice to scatter north where “blood pooled deepest” crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the renunciation of further battlefields carries visible cost. Interiority never slips into label-speak; instead, “ancestral dice” tactile detail keeps emotion grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s longing for Mira is viscerally anchored in the waxed leaf, but his shift from corpse-tracker to life-hunter is asserted rather than dramatized; the single moment of shared hand-clasp is too slight to bear the weight of “meaningful change.” Mira’s body-hunter turn is intriguing yet arrives as exposition, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Interiority leans on lyrical repetition (“wild hush”) that sometimes substitutes for embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her breaths sync with the dying station, the compass rose pulses against her skin, and her ancestral oath is whispered at the leap—yet the ‘blessed pariah’ label is stated more than dramatized; we see crew scorn only by report, so the social crucible never quite bites. Still, every beat of the sketching ritual is a micro-choice that narrows her options and forecloses the station forever, so motivation coheres and the final renunciation carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid—“heart pounding in cautious abandon,” treating horror “as a riddle”—but the emotional arc is smoothed by abstract self-labeling (“chivalrous,” “sacredly playful”) rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive swap is motivated, yet the cost (a few frost snaps and gratitude) feels light for cosmic stakes; no path is foreclosed. Flaw: diagnostic label-speak peaks at “guilt had felled the old guardian,” flattening a beat that should hurt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thorne’s interiority is vivid—his obsession with “small gestures” is embodied in the word-walk ritual—but the penumbra’s severance feels more metaphysical than earned; no prior flaw or cost links the shadow to his archival drive, so the final renunciation registers as conceptual rather than painful.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet dreading memory—surface in every tactile beat (the trembling hand, the feather’s rasp). The cost is legible: sealing her talent left her hollow, unsealing it floods her with thunder that will now never quiet. The final stance—home is the archive she walks—carries credible renunciation: she forfeits literal return to become living conduit. Interiority is silver-veined and idiosyncratic, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in the bone pawn he never stops turning; every micro-choice—plucking a crimson strand, aligning it with the pawn’s edge—externalizes the interior contradiction between love and betrayal. The “fierce repose” crystallizes a credible endurance that forecloses self-loathing; the cost is the admission that desperation, not malice, rigged the board. No second character is on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; the crucible is strictly intra-personal and sustains pressure. The only minor slip is a hair of therapeutic self-labeling (“forgive oneself”) voiced internally, but it is earned by the mirror’s unvarnished image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s contradiction between playful mischief and vengeful fire is dramatized in every beat; the charcoal “warpaint” smear crystallizes her refusal to forgive while the nursery-ditty hook shows the manipulative grin that lets her recruit the youths. Father-exile flashback arrives early, is anchored to a bone-wall mural she now re-paints, and directly fuels the final act of scattering verses. The closure choice—send the kids away to infect tomorrow’s ritual—carries visible social cost: she stands alone under a spire that will brand her traitor at dawn. No safety-hedging; her flaws (manipulative glee, hatred) are the engine, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear arc from doubt to certainty via embodied memory-work; the “kintsugi” quilting of scars is a fresh interior device. Emotion stays somatic—lungs burning, fingers steady—avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices (slotting charm, narrating each scar) visibly trace the hierarchy of regrets. Final smile is earned because each pockmark beat has forced a forgone cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s “intimately aloof” painter who has evaded finishing the shell for decades is vividly particular; his trembling hand, salt-tinged nostalgia, and final tear-legible renunciation embody contradictory impulses under pressure and foreclose the path of endless deferral with visible emotional cost. The interiority stays concrete—no stock therapeutic labels—and the shell-as-talisman anchors every micro-choice. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; head-count is within default. Closure choice is earned by lifelong causality; cost is felt as the crystal’s light gutters out.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically specific—“screaming tenderness,” “garden at night” scent—yet the turn from bellowing to whispering relies on a distilled epiphany rather than on-page contradictory impulses. Mira remains an off-stage idealized object; her return is felt but not tested under pressure, so the relationship crucible is implicit, not dramatized. The earned cost is present—the spent vial, the reopened arms—but the beat that proves his flaw is summarized, not lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s patchwork body and reverse-migration obsession are vividly embodied; every burn and graft is a lived waypoint. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final choice to light the censer is the direct culmination of his compulsive atlas of loss. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible off the page, but the object interaction supplies equivalent pressure. The earned smile into dawn shows credible endurance with cost—scars still ache—so the arc closes under its own momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's compulsive truth-telling and rational mycologist bent are shown through sensor-mapping and soil pH probes, not labels; the glass-eye insertion is a brutal micro-choice that visibly costs him pain and split sight, earning later silence. His need for “psychological safety” propels every beat; the occlusion’s immediate trade-off—relief versus deceit—grounds the final charged poise. Internal contradiction is alive as he wonders if he has healed or only “draped fractures in silken deceit,” keeping moral ambiguity unsentimental. No stock phrasing; the eye’s “storm-trapped moon” gleam is his perceptual lens, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory interiority—eccentric driftwood carver turned memory-thief—emerges in concrete micro-choices (pocketing the flower, pinning it to his own coat). His embodied grief under pressure, crystallized when he recognizes the Alpine echo of his own lost betrothed, earns the Earned Stasis closure. The muttered gulls and “hesitant heartbeat” lantern anchor trait; the gaps he pursues are literal blind spots that force costly mis-reading until the final reprise. Only minor backstory spillage keeps it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—empirical map-dealer rigor vs. ache for connection—remains embodied (sweat, trembling calipers) and drives every micro-choice. His veneration of the spiral chip and decision to crawl after ants are specific to his obsessional compass; the final smile at a customer shows credible earned stasis. Loneliness-as-choice is stated early but only *felt* once orchids press on his desk, a shade late. Still, no therapeutic self-labeling; flaws steer tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elowen’s disenchantment and thirst for self-reclamation are etched in every beat; the “spider-silk menace” interiority is concrete, never abstract. Her final inhale of starlight is a visceral micro-choice that costs her the last of her innocence, earning the Resonant Reconfiguration. Thorne’s quiet anchor role is efficient, though his interiority remains a cipher—acceptable at this length. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse under the velvet command.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirien’s contradictory impulses—rational alchemist vs. longing friend—are dramatized in the whisper beat, but the inner split is told more than shown earlier; Thorne’s pressure is present yet his interiority is thin, so the relationship crucible glows but never scalds. The final shared endurance earns a credible stasis, yet the cost feels slightly abstract because both characters’ flaws stay verbalized, not bodily paid.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory envy of her past selves is embodied viscerally (“hot and irrational,” “savage, clawing yearning”) and drives the lucid-break mechanism; the final renunciation of jealousy lands with visible cost as she folds the scroll and shoulders the next commission. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Could nudge 9+ if the earlier selves were given one more micro-choice apiece to sharpen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her smell-loss reframes perception through touch and drip-synced pulse. The midwife-screw memory moment is earned: she recognizes the thread, chooses to preserve it, and that micro-choice reweights her own grief. One contradiction—her “steady yet trembling” calm—never complicates later action, so the flaw stays minor. No secondary character on page, so status/pressure crucible bullets are waived; single-POV interiority is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s compulsion to inscribe her pain into legacy is embodied early (“her motivation burned”) and visibly crystallises on her arms under stress; the quill’s micro-choices mirror this drive. Interiority is concrete and war-specific (“thoughts flickered… half-remembered charms”) rather than diagnostic. The flaw-to-triumph arc is tidy—no lingering consequence or moral ambiguity—so the final choice feels rational rather than costly. Yet interior contradiction, bodily stakes, and the transformation of scars into narrative manacles all track cleanly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s guilt-driven hunt through the archive is visceral; the bottle-clutch and lace-cuff singe register embodied cost. The apology is not a speech but a kneeling inhale of ozone and fruit-rot—perfectly character-specific. No interior therapy-speak; her self-loathing is shown via synesthesia of scent and spark. The fractured Theo-mosaic nods forgiveness, yet the powdering glass in her fist forecloses any tidy absolution—earned stasis with splinter evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s drive remains cohesive: the need to mend “cosmic illusions” powers every step. Interiority stays particular (the dictionary page “bloomed with diagrams,” his boots “whispering on marble”). The closing renunciation—dictionary dissolving into light—carries visible cost and is prepared by earlier bodily tremor. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the 9-quick fails; still, a hair under the line.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational shepherd vs. obsessed seeker—is dramatized in the key twist, his trembling hand and backward count embodying cost. The “razor edges” obsession is shown through tactile ritual, not label-speak. Final renunciation lands with visible price: key edges dulled, horizon steady, his stance crystallized. One hairline slip: “understand what clocks really measure” drifts toward thesis-statement, not embodied need.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “spatial gift” lets her trace photons in four dimensions, a trait that immediately enables the laser test and later justifies the algorithm tweak. The quiet wildfire metaphor threads her obsession, embodied when she pockets the device “transformed,” showing cost. Elias is sketched only as catalyst, not crucible, so relationship/status bullets stay mute, yet his spore-handoff still pressures her permeability insight. One flaw: the “revolutionize” beat is declared, not dramatized; still, her micro-choice to let the rat pass (track the echo) earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interior contradiction—adoring her father's equations yet fearing his ruin—remains concrete in the lantern-handling beats and the micro-choice to board the train; the final renunciation to publish responsibly is seeded early and paid with the candle's extinguished cost. The only drag is a faint therapeutic overtone ("widen perspectives responsibly") that never quite becomes an embodied flaw with visible fallout; still, the hierarchy of values is legible and the arc feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s contradictory need for intimacy and severance is embodied in every micro-choice—spinning the disc, hanging up mid-sentence—so the final estrangement feels earned. Mira’s arc from clinging to release is dramatized, not declared. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-explanation (“to teach endings how to begin”) that slightly blurs interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s obsessive need to “preserve small moments” is embodied in every micro-choice (hand-picking petals, the bone spoon). The contradiction—her joy at reunion is inseparable from grief—remains active in-scene. The locket kiss and translucent reprise give visible cost, fulfilling the Earned Stasis/RR test.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s jocular mask cracks in the final beats, showing embodied cost (“voice cracking like dry leaves”), but interiority leans on label-speak (“craved his own relief: the cure for loneliness”). Micro-choices (passing the rock, lingering at dawn) earn the shift from elusive to present, yet contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elar’s interiority pulses through embodied sensation—“his skin drank the earth’s mutterings”—and every beat is filtered through his blindness, giving consistent POV-specific perception. The ring’s warming, the soil’s ink-like seepage, the braille of air constitute micro-choices that track his rising emotional stake. Grief is never labeled; it arrives as “unresolved chords” that the stillpoint finally harmonizes, so the renunciation of the ring feels earned. Only minor over-clearness in the final self-explanatory tear keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the seeds and hunger for cosmic order—stay active in every beat; the pen-touch moment crystallizes both. Her decision to write revision rather than erasure is earned by the prior sensory overload of floating vines and dead colleagues’ ghost-memories. Cost is felt: she renounces the old self who planted chaos and accepts perpetual uncertainty as the price of editorship. Interiority stays concrete—“her arm feel leaden and featherlight at once”—never sliding into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Finn’s interiority is vivid—his evaporated melodies and finger-tracing on water embody loss—but Elara’s motives crystallize only through sign-language poetry, never through private contradiction; the final “joyful sorrow” is declared not dramatized, so the micro-choice cost feels slightly abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-forged focus and “volcanic tenderness” give her a visceral, embodied interiority; every micro-choice (brushing the figurine, piecing the slashed portrait) grows from the twin engines of love and rage. The final collapse beside Theo’s marble lovers is a credibly earned renunciation—she accepts guardianship in place of reunion—whose cost is felt in the whisper of his name. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “analytically intuitive mind” is diagnostic label-speak that momentarily cools the lava.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interiority is sensuous and specific—pain lancing through the harness, soles tingling on vibrating grass—while her refusal to “breathe life into their shared dream” converts quiet rebellion into costly agency. The drumming chain reveals a believable hierarchy of values: Kai’s memory > pain > survival. Kai’s coalescence from auric mist is the earned pivot; her earlier guinea-pig passivity is actively shed underwater when the harness dissolves—visible cost, no therapeutic self-talk. Contradictory impulses (sorrow vs. defiance) coexist inside single rhythmic beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s whisper-versus-shout creed is embodied in every beat: the folded-map micro-choices, the gait-mimicry, the low-voice taunts. Interior contradiction shows when he feigns disinterest while “mind raced.” Final forfeiture of Harlan’s coin and maps costs Elias nothing personal, but his earned stance—whispers win—lands as credible renunciation of louder paths. Voice stays distinct; no diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s mute grace and Umbra’s slow thaw are rendered through incremental, embodied beats—mirror-tilt, shutter-click—so motive stays legible without speech. The spiral-calm trait actively shapes tactics (she never rushes, never protests), generating visible cost when she exhausts the final pattern and withdraws in silence. Interior contradiction is light: only a hinted ache of surrendered voice, but it surfaces through the mirrored starlight rather than label-speak. Closure turn is her choice to stop weaving, accept that darkness now carries its own faint stars—an earned renunciation that leaves her vigil unbroken yet altered.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “gift” is shown through immediate, tactile use (aligning pawns, cradling the rook). Contradictory impulses are present: obedience vs. quiet sabotage, risk vs. safety. The final quiet smile is earned because the text has dramatized his listening and the cost of secrecy. Still, the absence of on-page opposition keeps the pressure semi-abstract; the cost is felt but not sharpened through a second character’s live resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grace as a dock worker is vividly embodied, but the sudden merfolk reveal feels unseeded—no prior embodied contradiction or micro-choice foreshadows it, so the final shift lands as a label rather than a earned transformation. Interiority is strong until the climax; the tears and whispered confession are performed, not lived, weakening the cost. Relationship crucible works: the scrimshaw forces a mutual softening that alters their status. The mer reveal is competence without prior struggle, capping the arc short of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The porcelain-mask vacancy is viscerally maintained; every micro-choice (licking the blood, tying the ribbon) embodies her detachment. The internal contradiction—needing to “cultivate lightness” while frozen—drives every beat. The final renunciation (no tears, next branch) is earned: she has paid with the husband’s life and her own emotional nullity. Only the tiniest reserve: we never feel the pulse that insists on tomorrow’s performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation is legible—poet wants to dissolve “sacred boundaries” through verse—but interiority stays abstract (“burned like a hidden ember”) and we never feel bodily risk or contradiction; the “aesthetically driven” trait is declared repeatedly rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. No secondary character present, so relationship crucible not tested. Endurance/renunciation is nominally present but the cost is atmospheric, not personal or embodied, so the arc feels more symbolic than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile, color-blind aesthetic is concrete and consistent; his refusal to trade for sight is earned by prior beats that show him cheruring flaws. The micro-choice to blow a wavering, imperfect note on the reed tongue crystallizes his hierarchy of values under pressure. Mira’s off-stage sleep limits her to a reactive role, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only lightly traced. Internal contradiction is present but compressed; still, the renunciation carries visible cost and satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—gentle fingers vs. burn to “reclaim the texture of connection”—is embodied in every bell-strike. Micro-choices (tightening the carbide lens, bending laughter into a hush) visibly trade volume for intimacy, paying a cost in immediacy. The final kneel is earned: she confronts the scarred grit of disconnection and accepts its persistence. Missing secondary pressure keeps her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s grief-fuelled arc is rendered through tactile jeweller’s habits and origami precision; every fold and piercing is a micro-choice that externalises her interiority. The memory of her husband is threaded into each crane without sliding into epiphany-speak, and her final quiet smile carries visible cost: she has traded permanent widowhood for itinerant caretaker of dying stars. The only nit is a near-algorithmic repetition of “subdued ardor” that nudges her reactions toward template cadence, slightly flattening contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” mantra is shown through tactile card-and-tape work, but her interiority stays general; the final shared resolve is credible yet the cost feels light. Theo’s hollowness is sketched more than embodied, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is present but thin. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the beat where she “adjusted a path’s angle by one degree” is the closest we get to visible internal friction. Voice distinction is moot—only Elara speaks—so the single-POV baseline is met but not exceeded.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive to “pierce the veil of history’s lies” is vivid, yet interiority lapses into abstract summary (“anguished joy surged”) rather than embodied contradiction. The key renunciation—shattering her veil—lands, but the prior beats show methodical adaptation more than irreconciable impulse, so the cost feels announced rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s vigilance and grief feel embodied in her tactile orbit-tending and river-stone pocketing, but her interiority slips into thematic abstraction (“preserve the shape of hope”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The metamorphosis choice is signaled early yet the on-page cost is reported rather than lived: we are told she “mourned the human warmth” instead of feeling the chill ascend her spine. Still, her perceptual signature—night-shift librarian of shared dreams—remains specific enough to lift her above a cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her calloused palms, the tremor in her convictions—yet the moment she “whispered encouragement” to a tail-tip the beat tilts toward sentiment. The shedding metaphor is deployed as an externalized action rather than a label, and her final micro-choice (tucking the tip into velvet) crystallizes the cost of trust. Flaw: the betrayal backstory is summarized, so the guilt layer feels recited rather than earned in scene. Still, her contradiction—gentleness as strength—propels the closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s scar-thirst is palpable early and drives every shovel of earth; her contradictory need to wound herself for wisdom feels lived-in, not programmatic. The discovery of her parents’ letters reframes her self-cutting obsession into an earned reconfiguration of identity. Micro-choices—prying the stone with the hourglass, bleeding into soil—chart a credible hierarchy of values under stress. Flaw: one moment of diagnostic self-tag (“closure seeker who opened wounds”) risks label-speak, slightly blunting embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her spatial imagination is dramatized in tactile beats (“every alcove and echo unfolded”). Motivation is anchored to a concrete loss (vanished fiancé), and her final choice to keep the letters while returning the knowledge is earned. The flaw—therapeutic self-diagnosis (“unused love wasn’t inert”)—breaks embodied immediacy once, but contradiction under pressure is otherwise shown, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically particular (“moonstruck dreamer” is shown through nocturnal vigils, dust-covered canvases), but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than staged in scene; the decisive surrender to rest is narrated, not embodied under pressure, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but abstract; “dreamless” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The guard’s sudden swell of purpose is announced, not excavated through conflicting impulses; no micro-choice shows him wavering. Embodiment is atmospheric rather than kinesthetic; we see petals and ash but not how they chafe or warm his skin. The ending smile arrives without visible cost or foregone path, so the shift feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—cynical detachment vs. hunger for “wild frontier”—is dramatized in the gear-to-temple beat; the fused gear at the end is a visible, irreversible cost. The arc from sterile exile to “verdant chaos” is earned because each arboreal voice strips one layer of self-doubt on the page. Minor slip: “petrified psyche” is diagnostic shorthand amid otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s longing for freedom is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“courage lingered, untapped, like shells”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The final self-punch is a concrete micro-choice, yet prior beats summarize emotional states instead of embodying them under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s thawing nerves externalize guilt and complicity; micro-moments—handing over the keycard, pressing the bolt back into Thorne’s palm—chart a believable shift from self-absolution to shared penance. Thorne’s non-verbal aria silently owns his error; the grief in “frost, not tears” embodies consequence without verbal confession. Both men remain recognizably flawed; Elias’s stay extends complicity rather than absolving it, a costly Earned Stasis. Internal contradiction holds throughout: safety seduces and suffocates, motivating each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirion’s quiet, scholarly vigil is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted (“titanic essence” vs. child-size) rather than dramatized in a moment of choice; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is cosmic, not personal—he never risks or loses anything we see. Still, the embodied image of the tiny guardian amid infinite shelves keeps him particular.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and reef-witness identity drive every micro-choice; the tapping ritual embodies memory under isolation and the final broadcast is a credible renunciation of solitude that costs him the safety of silence. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles, rust, salt-sting—and the contradiction between scientific detachment and grief is kept live in scene. The only minor slack: the “metamorphosis” realization is slightly therapy-speak adjacent, but it is immediately grounded in the atlas fold and transmission act, so the cost still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and stargazer identity are vivid, but “awkwardly confident” is asserted more than dramatized—she never trips, hesitate-talks, or pays a social price. Interiority stays lyrical (“the galaxy itself urged her onward”) rather than concrete and contradictory under stress. The stone-circle beat gives her a cosmic zap that re-ignites the rebellion, yet the cost is off-loaded to unseen fighters; her own stance change feels gifted, not earned through visible flaw or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s insurgent past and present gardener identity cohere; her telepathy and amber possession feel pre-loaded rather than earned in-scene, muting contradiction. Interiority is vivid (“her breath caught”), but the decisive plunge reads as foregone once plants chorus—cost is present yet not intensely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s quiet-talent trait drives two on-page grafting beats and the mentorship moment, so the attribute is dramatized, not merely labelled. The drone-survivor past is anchored to present stimuli (photo find, wind-whine) and triggers a credible freeze response that alters her micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete (“somatic marker igniting from gut to spine”) and avoids therapy-speak until the single word “trauma,” which is cushioned by immediate embodied fallout. Final stance—grounded optimism—pays visible cost: she relinquishes the photo as wound and offers it as bridge to the younger woman, earning the closure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for perfection while fearing his own grotesque sight—remains vivid and embodied (“luminescent ache settled in his chest”). The micro-choice to kneel and untangle threads dramatizes a value hierarchy (art vs. self-annihilation) with visible cost. Yet the final “wondering rhetorically” moment drifts into diagnostic self-summary rather than lived contradiction, slightly softening the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s “consciously wild” nature is shown through braiding feathers into his hair and choosing to crush the drone rather than analyze it; the contradiction between serene anger and feral instinct is embodied, not labeled. The final step into the ink is a micro-choice that costs him literal corporeal stability, sealing his arc. Mira remains a cipher; her motivations are asserted (“return and wield it”) rather than dramatized, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“duty warring with a deeper urge” is tangible—and her micro-choice to transmit the letter shows a hierarchy of values. The flaw is that the “bravely conflicted” trait is named repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory embodied action; the moment she overrides safeguards is decisive but could carry sharper bodily cost. Still, the shift from loyal archivist to silent traitor is legible and irreversible, satisfying the earned-change test.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s pacifist convictions collide with her father’s legacy in two concrete beats: the dagger-draw-then-sheathe and the thorn-trip instead of stab. Interiority stays embodied (“hands sinking into sun-warmed soil”) without therapy-speak. The roses’ evolved pollen feels like a convenient late power; still, her renunciation of blood carries visible cost when the looters flee and the farm survives maimed but unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s calm-under-pressure trait is embodied in every micro-choice; the “voicing silence” tactic shows interior contradiction (need to act vs. need to stay still) and costs him nothing yet feels earned. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Final pocketing of the echo is a credible renunciation of triumph, keeping him flat-affect and consistent. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s observant trait is dramatized in the ledger cross-examination (strong micro-choice), but the interior contradiction between filial loyalty and investigative drive is told more than shown; the pen-nib heirloom is handled twice but never truly endangers or costs her anything, so the “earned” aspect feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Guilt-driven interiority is vivid and embodied; the amber’s hum on his arm is a tactile scar. The single-scene arc from denial to self-inking shows clear contradictory impulses under pressure. Cost is visible: the insect buzz now lullabies inside his skin, foreclosing innocence. Minor slip: “arrogant” label in flashback could be shown sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s whimsical yet socially perceptive nature is vividly embodied through tactile mandala-work and live micro-reads of Marta vs. Theo; the tile flake feeds her interiority without lapsing into diagnostic talk. Her final decision to scatter the pattern is a credible renunciation that costs her the fragile unity she just forged, sealing earned stasis. No contradiction under pressure; traits bend choices in every beat. The only minor drag: the text tells “ whimsical” twice instead of letting chalk-play alone speak.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle yet steel-armed—remains vivid and embodied; the retrocognitive loop forces her into repeated, costly re-witnessing that visibly erodes her. The shift from passive victim of memory to active re-namer is credibly driven by the tessera’s concrete cue and her prior radical trait. Kael/Kaelon’s off-screen transformation is summarized, not dramatized, so the relational crucible test is weak; survivors’ gestures toward him are reported in aggregate, reducing pressure. Still, her final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the loosening of her own trap is tied directly to the price of embracing a monster, earning the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s synesthesia and stage-trauma are vivid, but her “despair” is asserted more than dramatized; the pivot from passive nostalgia to active singing feels sudden because the coin’s agency overshadows hers. Reginald’s pleading is clear, yet his own entrapment remains abstract, softening the cost of the pact. Interior contradiction is present (gift=curse) but not sharpened into a micro-choice until the final note; earlier beats lean on spectacle. Still, the ending’s Earned Stasis—she pockets the coin and books a gig—makes the renunciation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” is consistently embodied—she hugs Theo while doubting the telepathy—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice. Her somatic markers are shown, yet the final “certainty” feels sudden because the prior beats let her doubt recede rather than bite. The micro-choice to blind-test Theo is motivated, but the cost (losing skepticism) is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s hunger to “voice the unknown” is palpable and embodied—she fondles the fossil as if it could speak through her skin. The micro-choice to press it to her sternum crystallizes the internal contradiction between cartographer’s control and surrender to unmapped feeling. When she later releases the relic to the tide, the renunciation costs her omniscience and visibly ends her mapping days, earning the Earned Stasis. Flaw: the apprentice coda is summarized, muting the final visible price on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quietly inspired motivation is anchored in concrete micro-choices (clearing the bench, lifting the jar, reversing the master hourglass) that visibly cost him calm and certainty; the internal contradiction between guarding fate and freeing it is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The “quiet inspiration” trait is repeatedly embodied (trembling fingers, deliberate grace) rather than labeled, and the final renunciation—carrying the liberated echo upward—forecloses the old role with felt cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; single-POV interiority remains coherent and character-specific. The only minor drag is a few stock phrases (“time’s cruel knot,” “raw possibility”) that slightly dilute voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s scarred caution versus relic-mentor impulse is alive; the pill stimulant hand-off crystallises his “fixer” identity and costs him Lena. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The poise of self-exile is earned, but we don’t see competing impulses in the rook-nest beat; he declares rather than dramatises his final withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—duty to untangle vows versus the serenity that mending brings—is dramatized through the needle’s micro-choices. Embodied emotion (fingers steady while rain slows) keeps sentiment off the page. The final knot costs him the comforting clutter of inherited ambiguity, a credible renunciation. Cap at 8.7 because the passenger remains a mirror, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s quiet, potter-tuned perception stays consistent; his desire to decipher the oasis is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing murals, centering clay). The phototropic-to-kindness trait motivates every pivot and is paid for in the final vessel that maps endurance. No contradictory interiority or stock labels; the only flaw is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s wistful-pragmatic contradiction is embodied early—kneeling over the rose corpse yet pocketing the gauge—but the interior conflict is stated more than dramatized; Mira remains a silhouette of loss rather than a second pressure crucible, so the relationship shift feels charitable rather than compelled. The gauge hand-off is a clean micro-choice that scales to the length, yet the cost (giving away her talisman) is declared, not felt—no visible after-shock in Elara’s body or future tactics. Still, both characters avoid therapeutic self-diagnosis and the final pruning action is a credible, quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s loneliness-to-sovereignty arc is legible and embodied in wing-tingling and breath-sync, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky micro-choice; the hum accepts her without her having to sacrifice or misstep. The “brittle awakenings” are reiterated more than dramatized, so the turn feels foregone rather than earned. Still, the reincarnation grief anchors every beat and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost—she now commands tides alone.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s haunted loneliness and covert craft are vivid; her decision to surrender anonymity at the spiral carries felt cost. Interiority occasionally slips into lyrical shorthand (“whimsy inevitable” twice) rather than embodied contradiction. Theo remains silhouette-plus-letter; his agency is asserted not dramatized, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s hunger for truth vs. protective love of her town—drives every micro-choice. Her embodied reactions (sweat, bone-conduction buzz) externalize stakes without lapsing into diagnostic speak. The final renunciation (eternal vigilance) carries visible fatigue-cost, earned by prior causality. Only minor hedge: Harlan’s opportunism sketched a touch generically, softening status crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and prudence are stated repeatedly but never embodied in moment-to-moment sensory panic; the “terror” is label-only when walls twist. The compass-point burn and organ chord are the only embodied choices; interior contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. Closure earns a mild renunciation of fear, but the cost is abstract—no lingering physical or social price shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s face-blindness and methodical ritual are vividly embodied; the prick-by-prick escalation to blood-on-ribbon fusion shows contradictory impulses (detached artist vs. awakening empathy) in one beat. Interiority avoids label-speak, using tactile cues (“ruby against gray stone”). Final portrait unveiling is earned by prior causality with visible scar-cost. Slight safety-hedge: empathy “blooms eternal” edges toward tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “nervously confident” tic is dramatized in trembling fingers and ringing declarations; the ancestor-honor motive drives every risk. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse a nervous tattoo”) without label-speak. The copper-nail moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values—maps over safety—with visible dread-sweat cost, earning the family-name restoration. Minor slip: the “idealistic” trait is asserted more than tested beyond her faith in maps.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fiddler’s grief-thread (“never trust a stranger’s tale again”) is concrete, embodied in the twitch to play yet the refusal to trust. The flake-find and scaffold-map read as micro-choices that re-open his world; the vow at the bridge carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but once slips into diagnostic-speak (“pixelated amnesty” repeated as label) which blunts edge. Still, the arc of guarded→re-opened is fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “polished calm” is stated so often it becomes a label, not a lived contradiction; the single micro-choice—illuminating the hoops—merely repeats the stance he already owns, so no new interior fracture or cost appears. Father-legacy guilt is asserted but never complicates his tactics; Raoul’s greed is generic, giving Elias no status jolt to react against. Closure is Earned Stasis, yet the cost is abstract (“paths circle back”) rather than a palpable forfeiture felt in body or wallet.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thorne’s interiority is textured—his dream-entry ritual, tactile journal, and star-dust glyph tracing show embodied emotion.  Lyra’s exhaustion is filtered through his watchful sympathy, creating a credible marital crucible.  The final “shared alignment” moment crystallizes a micro-choice hierarchy: her tears vs. his risk of dream-burnout, cost visible.  Minor slip: “midnight solace” becomes a repeated label; still, the contradiction between lucid control and bodily sweat keeps him credibly flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s contradictory impulses—guardian of lost things vs. self-eraser of his worst deed—are dramatized in the blood-onto-seed beat; the interiority stays embodied, not diagnostic. The moment he hesitates before cutting his palm shows the flaw that powers the climax. Cost is visible: he limps out with seed-husk in flesh and a stripped psyche. Voice remains singular; no committee drift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s “purposefully curious” label is repeated but never tested by contradictory choice; her interiority drifts into abstract cosmic inventory (“cities of glass…temporal storms”) rather than embodied dilemma. Root-bound body is vivid, yet the fusion never limits or complicates her visionary plunge—no cramp, no tearing, no refusal. Final beat claims anxious elation but shows only triumph, so the promised cost never lands on her body or bond. She remains a concept, not a person who bleeds when the covenant is re-sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Achieves fierce interiority through tactile, embodied beats (“callused…clandestine rituals”, blood drip onto bones) that fuse motive to micro-action. The contradictory impulse is present—“never forced; instead…inlaying meaning”—but shown only once, so the arc leans summary rather than sustained contradiction; still, the final trammel choice carries visible bodily cost and is earned by earlier ritual groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    The interiority is vivid—Harl’s “confidently uncertain” mantra is embodied in the loupe/notebook ritual—but the emotional arc stays on a single register of bruised nostalgia; no contradictory impulse ever threatens to derail his plan. The final decision (authenticate the scrap, build a memorial) is declared rather than dramatized, so the cost feels prospective, not paid on the page. Still, the occupational texture of antiques appraisal gives him a sharp, specific lens that distinguishes him from generic wounded-rocker types.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s kindly-methodic profile is surface-true—his gentle soil-patting and measured tablet-work show it—but the trait never costs him anything or collides with an opposite impulse; it’s a label, not a crucible. The interior contradiction (ambition vs. kindness) is announced, never dramatized under pressure; no moment forces him to choose between accelerating the arbor’s fall or saving people versus hoarding knowledge. Closure is quiet stasis, not a renunciation that hurts, so the change feels cosmetic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her hesitation breathes through “waves lapping her ankles.” The librarian’s motivation is locked to the furnace image, a tangible engine of want. Contradictory impulses (archivist vs. cartographer) clash in-scene, not summary; the final fusion costs her the safety of a fixed self. Only micro-slip: “wonder reigniting like wintersun on frost” drifts toward label-speak (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s wound (Mira) is concrete, his micro-choice to crown the node with the pearl is legible, and the cost (relinquishing bunker-as-tomb) is felt. Interiority stays specific to his sensory bias (“mineral tang,” “flashlight’s infinite shards”) and avoids label-speak. The flaw: his “hardened heart” is stated more than dramatized in scene; we’re told the bunker walls symbolize isolation rather than shown a live moment where that wall almost blocked him. Still, the final renunciation is earned by the shell’s confessions and the pearl’s glow, fulfilling the motive with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt-sharpened recall versus the need to keep chronicling—are alive in every tactile choice (testing sink stability, tracing graffiti with the same fingertip that once drafted the fatal bridge map). The accordion’s taped fragility literalizes his interior patch-job; the micro-choice to hoist onto the sill re-enacts the dare that killed his apprentice, now inverted as self-audit. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak; “raw edges” and “wheezing bellows” keep thought embodied. Final notebook entry is earned renunciation: maps turned inward, cost visible in the still-wheezing instrument slung over shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dream vs empire—stays alive in every beat; the telepathic ivy scene literalizes her conflict under pressure. Embodied emotion (“mulberry ache” repeated) risks tinting into label-speak, but the bow tremor and stained saucer ground it. The final hybrid stance is earned: propagation via violin mingles dominion with melody, foreclosing pure solitude. Micro-choices (brush ivy → play → set bow) trace a value hierarchy with visible cost: her dream is no longer solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirien’s dual vocation (beautician-mortician) is embodied in every micro-action—she handles dew-needle and shroud with the same reverence—so the premise feels lived, not labeled. The interior contradiction is dramatized: she hoards life while ushering death, and that tension spikes when she turns the needle on herself. The spark-transfer costs her literal vitality—her knees tremble, breath thins—so the self-infusion is earned. The only drag is a touch of epic diction (“eons of service”) that abstracts rather than embodies fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “kindly decisive” trait is dramatized in every beat—pruning, exile verdict, the scalping of the rebirth flower—so the trait is motive not label. The interior contradiction between caretaker tenderness and ruthless renewal is felt in her fingertips on bark and on petals, giving embodied emotion under pressure. The closure choice to scallop the flower is earned by the hairpin vision that fuses past betrayal and present duty, paying visible cost in sap and trembling petal. Only the kin’s off-stage fire keeps the relational crucible from full pressure on the page, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s premature-aging wound and lab-weariness are sharp, but her interiority slips into abstract “realization” rather than embodied contradiction. Voss stays archetype-still; his withheld method reads as plot convenience, not personal creed. No micro-choice on the page tips Elara into the grotto—only trance-osmosis—so the cost feels inherited, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thren’s centuries-long vigil is a credible, embodied renunciation that costs him his body; the wandering pulse’s final transfer is earned by iterative, escalating micro-choices (skimming stones, enduring dust, refusing to leave). Interiority stays concrete—“dust settling anew on his hooded form,” “pulse quicken against his skin”—never sliding into diagnostic gloss. The only abstraction, “historically reverent soul,” is immediately grounded in ritual action (cradling, skimming, appraising). Final stasis—body ossified, mind roaming—pays the price promised from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thorne’s “underachieving” label is shown, not told—his spells fizzling, the straps, his awed hesitation—until the final grasp of the keystone crystallizes a credible shift from mediocrity to bearer-of-dawn; the cost (unstrapping, solo ascent, exile from automation) is felt. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic speak. Flaws complicate every step: straps throttle talent, fear of failure governs mist-walk timing. The closing image of lantern-light reframes him without erasing prior inadequacy—Earned Stasis with visible freight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s grief and refusal to accept Lira’s loss are concrete—key tag in pocket, boots sinking into silt—but interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“luminous vow burned brighter”) that blurs contradiction. The final reunion is touching yet feels externally granted; the key-tag glow and coalescence arrive without a visible cost exacted from him. No micro-choice after entering the library tests his resolve or forces trade-off; he simply receives. Lira’s transformation is revealed, not struggled for, so the arc lands sentimental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm against cosmic dread—is embodied every time she fondles the coins; the final broadcast is earned because each prior cast visibly narrowed her risk. Micro-choices (coin toss, ink on amber shard) dramatize her hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-labeling. No second character appears, so status and relationship criteria are waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete, never abstractly “doubtful.” The only blemish is a hairline slip into “stellar doubt mocked every claimant,” a compressed personification that momentarily outsources her felt cost to the cosmos instead of keeping it in her fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elowen's grief is viscerally embodied—tears refracting light, hands trembling against the plinth—while her contradictory impulses (to mourn vs. to master) play out in real time. Each naming ("Krathor…Nyxara…Vorath") is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses retreat; the crystallizing monsters become permanent external organs of her loss. The final image—scythe lifted, atlas page tucked away—earns its stoic resolve because we have watched her pay for it with Lirian’s voice still caught in the wax. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic label-speak; even “heartbroken reaper” is shown through reluctant harvests and a dulled blade.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elowen’s contradictory self-image—“lukewarm yet devoted”—is dramatized in every beat: his spells sputter while he kneels longer, fingers trembling, sweat freezing on the viaduct. The micro-choice to time each drip rather than force brute fire-magic externalizes his flaw and earns the final toll. Cost is visible: raw knuckles, cracked voice, and the moment he almost quits, “why him… when titans had failed,” which crystallizes the endurance that re-forges his brittle vow into tempered resolve. Interiority never slips into label-speak; instead, perception narrows to drip-rhythm and bone-pendulum, embodying stress.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—atonement through vigilance vs. the need to confess—are alive in every micro-choice; the final act of handing Mira the sapphire label crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is legible in the line “lighter, the levee stronger for truths aired.” Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; even the remembered hand-slip is rendered through the sensory shard “her hand slipping as waters claimed her.” The flaw-to-choice linkage is tight: his early oversight → lifelong penitentiary patrol → deliberate burning of the photos that could have exonerated him. No competence creep; the precisely humane trait is pressure-tested when he spares Mira any vengeance and instead gifts her the relic. Single-POV voice never wavers; no stock phrasing or epiphany shorthand. The only keep-out-of-9+ hairline: the boyish face in the final photograph is named but not enacted in scene, a summary micro-gesture that keeps the change one degree from full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—icy calculation versus the ache of hidden letters—are dramatized in the crystal-flame negotiation and the tear that escapes as the starlings bloom. The micro-choice to lift the thawing crystal exactly when the birds wheel into flower-form makes the sentimental cost visible and causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One hairline slip: “secretly sentimental proof” momentarily abstracts what the tear has already embodied. Still, the interior split propels every beat and is reconciled only at the iridescent steam, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—solitary vigilance vs. the need to safeguard another—collide in real time; his fingers rehearse the buckle fix on his own rig while coaching Lena, a visceral cost that forecloses emotional distance and cements earned isolation. The interiority is concrete, muscle-memory driven, never generic. The final refusal to descend with her, re-fastening his own buckle in arbor solitude, crystallizes the watcher’s burden as a lived price rather than a theme label.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kai’s interiority is vivid—“emotional numbness” is dramatized through the sterile way he notes history’s rewrites without flinching; the final flood of feeling lands as credible release because the void was consistently embodied earlier. The complementary duplicate is used as an externalized second self rather than a true relationship crucible, so status/relationship bullets remain n/a; the single-POV arc still satisfies. Micro-choice hierarchy is present—he trades blood for vivification, a visible cost that forecloses his prior stoic stance. Flaw: the clone’s first words (“Not duplicate…complement”) verge on thesis-label; the beat still carries embodied shock, so only light ding.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s puzzle-designer mind is vividly drawn; his perceptual filter (“orthogonal approaches”) is character-specific and drives every beat. Interiority stays concrete—he smells, touches, maps—but never tips into diagnostic self-talk. The final vow feels earned because the seed-mapping and UV-ink beats dramatize his need to protect creative space. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; he pivots intellectually, never emotionally torn, so the “cost” is conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “mournfully eager” repetition becomes hollow; it tells the same note instead of revealing new contradiction. His interiority is poetic label-speak (“macerate the unspoken”) rather than embodied perception under pressure. The baton pull-cords are vivid micro-choices, yet the climactic softening of parental ghosts is narrated, not dramatized through fresh interior friction. Earned cost is present—his fading form—but the emotional calculus is stated, not felt via conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral library guardian’s longing is vividly embodied (claws in frost, pendant pulse), but the “interiorizing” tactic is asserted more than dramatized; we watch the narrator declare “I drew him inward” rather than feel the contradiction or cost of swallowing the cultist’s essence. Homesickness propels the wait, yet the turn to friendship with uncertainty is lyrical declaration, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, the wild, book-scented voice is specific enough to lift the score into the solid 7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“each failure as a hidden thorn”); the alchemist’s quiet resolve under pressure shows stoic sensitivity without label-speak. Yet the arc pivots on a single declarative realization (“when the penny dropped fully”) rather than a dramatized contradictory impulse; the final choice is asserted, not earned through visible interior struggle. The absence of a second on-page character removes relationship pressure, so the crucible is purely self-driven; while credible, the cost is more atmospheric than personally stinging. Micro-choices are present but repetitive—each approximation is documented rather than conflicting with a fresh emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s creed (“find the beginning in every ending”) is dramatized through micro-choices—pocketing tools, climbing the vibrating ladder, rerouting feeds—so motive stays embodied. The interior contradiction between salvage-optimism and the risk of literal collapse is kept present via the groaning cables, giving her a visible cost. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority stays concrete, though one or two phrases (“practical triumph surging”) edge toward label. Earned renunciation of old maps at climax is causally tied to prior beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “resiliently positive” trait is stated repeatedly but never costs him anything or collides with contradiction; interiority stays performative (“his ardent heart swelling”) rather than embodied. The parallel-Elias beat supplies the only real internal friction, yet the merger diffuses rather than tests trait integrity. No micro-choice shows him tempted toward despair or paying a visible price for optimism, so the arc feels label-secured rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for authentic connection while clinging to rational control—drives every beat, but the memories that “alter” remain off-stage abstractions; we never see a single concrete before/after image, so the cost feels announced, not felt. The final “sinew’s echo” is a strong embodied token, yet the texture he sought is still told rather than lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “balanced curiosity” is asserted often but never tested by a contradictory impulse; she stays calm instructor. Kai’s want is clear, yet his only micro-choice—practicing the hologram—lacks visible internal friction or cost, so the arc feels instructional rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “persistent curiosity” is repeatedly named but never embodied in contradictory impulse or visible cost; the hearing-aid insertion is the sole micro-choice, and it reads as plot trigger rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. Clara’s suicidal stance is declared, not dramatized through gesture or interiority, so the relationship crucible never pressures Elara into a costly decision. Motivation stays flat: protecting “vulnerable voices” is asserted, not tested against competing goods. The ending’s “incidental heroism” is retroactively labeled instead of lived through a renunciation that actually costs Elara anything.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (rope-slick descent, belly-crawl, pulse in throat) and drives every tactical move; the decision to phase through rock is credibly prefaced by prior exposure to the codex. Micro-choices—tracing gold, syncing biofield—show values hierarchy, but the interior contradiction flips are narrated more than enacted in-scene, and the final emotional cost is asserted (“heart light”) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s heartbeat-counting tic is concrete and embodied, anchoring her near-death trauma; the parallel she draws between bureaucratic and scientific “errors” gives her a sharp, specific worldview. Interiority stays particular—no therapy-speak—and her micro-choices (ink pour, shard scrape) visibly enact her need to prove aliveness. The porcelain shard functions as both talisman and tool, creating a credible bridge between memory and action; the final moment of pocketing it crystallizes her earned stance. Motivation remains constant but not static, deepening as the ghost’s truth reframes her own survival.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thorne’s quiet articulation and copper-veined embodiment of language-loss give him a vivid, consistent interiority; the moment he pockets the diamond his contradictory hunger for preservation vs. self-ruin is staged in scene. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is NA. The final relinquishment—pouring the last textures into the gem—carries visible cost as his veins dim, earning the closure renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s bitterness-to-jest arc is dramatized in one continuous embodied sequence—tears freeze, palm embeds arrowhead, weightlessness hits—so the shift is legible. Yet the interior contradiction is stated (“my bitterness was the heaviest stone”) rather than shown in micro-choice before the phone call; the cosmic-joke motive stays thesis-level until the final whisper. Brother’s re-entrance is pure invitation, not crucible, so relationship pressure is felt only as wonder, not decision cost. Still, the physical mutation of grief into levity is individual and memorable, satisfying the 600-word bar for earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s pulse-and-music motive is concrete and embodied; the locust shell presses to her chest, the violin is weeping triumph. Contradictory impulses—fear of statues vs hunger for beauty—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final uproot is earned by the covert heart-rhythm signalling and the shell’s talismanic pressure; cost is felt as gears clatter “like defeated bones.” Only minor slip: “unyielding motivation” drifts toward diagnostic label; still, the interiority stays particular.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—law-abiding courier vs. clandestine ferryman—surfaces in every beat, embodied in the bottle’s pulse against his chest. His micro-choices (nodding to patrols, feeding the drone) reveal a hierarchy of values that costs him serenity, not safety. The final letter re-weights the stake from proxy rescue to personal reunion, earning the closure. Yet the bride remains rumor; her absence is felt but not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual more than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s muteness-as-vow is vivid and embodied; the halo fragment extraction and silent “song” dramatize contradictory impulses (preserve silence / release sound). The final endurance—leaving the oasis with the fragment’s pulse in his bones—earns a resonant renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: “interpret every silence as possibility” drifts toward label-speak in a peak beat, blunting full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s obsession is palpable and embodied in her tactile handling of the scarf; her quiet refusal to surrender to full immersion shows a credible, costly stance. Interiority is specific—hyperbolic arcs, pseudosphere models—never generic. The final micro-choice to shelve the pseudosphere while wearing the warmed scarf crystallizes her hierarchy of values: discovery yes, self-loss no. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc stops just short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s yearning is palpable, yet her interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“luminous absence”) that dampens embodied contradiction. The palette as conduit is a strong micro-choice, but the sister’s dying whisper is recounted rather than dramatized, softening the motivational bite. Final renunciation—accepting the dream as memory—earns credible cost, sealing a believable endurance. Voice remains consistent, but lyric overlay keeps contradiction at arm’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    The locksmith’s contradictory longing—freeing others while fearing his own release—surfaces late but is embodied in the pocketed hair talisman; the woman’s interiority is thinner, her desperation stated rather than textured. Micro-choices (ribbon-burn, coin gift) crystallize values, yet the epiphany “Your release stirs mine” leans declarative. Cost is felt when he stays behind, but the moment is compressed to a single hushed line. Still, the pair’s mutual mirroring gives sufficient relational crucible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s lifelong curiosity and the ache of stolen boyhood are rendered through tactile, scholar-body detail—callused fingers brushing silt, lantern held steady though hand trembles. The final palm-to-mushroom choice is credibly grown from earlier pattern-tracing and costs him the safety of forgetting; we feel the door close. Interiority stays concrete, but a few phrases (“crisp nostalgia sharpened his resolve”) flirt with label-speak, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—snapping while investing in Kai’s resilience—are vividly present and embodied in her backwards pacing. Kai’s interiority is thinner; his “resilience blooming” is asserted rather than shown through micro-choices. The mentor/ward relationship does act as crucible, altering both states by the end, yet Kai’s final shift feels lightly causally earned. The near-permanence of Elara’s own exile is hinted but not dramatized as a present-tense cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirien’s gentle-sage profile is vivid, but his interior contradiction (creative hunger vs. pruning restraint) stays narrated rather than enacted; the single micro-choice—handing over the seed—feels pre-ordained, not wrestled. Elowen functions more as wonder-receptacle than crucible, so relationship pressure is nil. The earned cost is present yet diffuse: the “frayed thread” he snips is described, not felt. Voice texture is strong enough to lift the score above mid-band, but the absence of a visible, personal price keeps it under 7.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirien’s scarred hands, velvet pouch ritual, and instant readiness to unpick the hush-net ground his vocation in embodied habit; the brother-memory supplies a clean motivational through-line that escalates with each rescued spirit. Interiority stays concrete—“unrest coiling in his chest” versus “porcelain smile” tension—showing simultaneous dread and duty without therapeutic gloss. Micro-choices (kneeling, brushing silt, selecting each shard) reveal a hierarchy of values in real time, and the final grounded chorus of spirits proves a visible change that costs him dawn’s exhaustion. The only cap is a hairline slip: the shade’s spontaneous materialisation is accepted without visible surprise, a minor glitch in an otherwise tight causal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief-rooted quest is vivid, but “shielded openness” is asserted more than embodied; the single on-page decision—pressing the keystone—aligns with his curiosity yet feels lightly foreshadowed, so the cost reads as gentle rather than irrevocable. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary, muting the beat where vulnerability might have crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior monologue glints like fish-scales—precise, cold, self-contradictory—and every micro-choice (shaking the globe, decrypting the note, surrendering coordinates) nails her erotic of detachment. The “physics of letting go” is dramatized, not announced, as she trades salvage for entropy while Elias watches. Cost is visible when she releases the globe: the gesture forecloses fame, riches, even future dives. One decimal short of 9 because the sister-ship backstory is asserted, not mined for flaw or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s vocation to “articulate unspoken needs” is concrete and embodied; her lute, pigments, and plate-handling show micro-choices rooted in that drive. Contradictory impulses surface when awe of the ghost competes with her own fear of silence, dramatized as trembling fingers yet steady singing. The final renunciation—releasing the ghost and accepting permanent audibility—pays a visible cost: she is left “seldom-heard” no more, the plate warm with transferred weight. Interiority avoids label-speak; emotion is pressed through tactile verbs and cloud-moss ink.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s warmly inquisitive nature is dramatized through the tactile act of opening the case and decoding the diary; the revelation that she is Elowen’s hidden child lands with visible cost as she closes the diary “with tender resolve,” blood-legacy now framing her future. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (“fingers trembled,” “breath caught”) without diagnostic gloss. The promotion-from-scullery status shift is the earned micro-choice that forecloses her old identity; no contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene, but the single-POV window keeps pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief-suffused obsession is embodied in every micro-choice: steadying against wicker, scribbling cloud-emotions, folding the origami gondola. The contradiction—seeking scientific proof through lyrical grief—drives every beat without therapeutic label-speak. Interiority is concrete, character-specific, and the final renunciation (adrift forever) costs everything on-page. Only the wife’s interior is ventriloquised, a minor safety-hedge.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s face-blindness is dramatized through her reliance on gesture and light; her calm dexterity under demolition pressure shows embodied expertise. The interior contradiction—wanting to preserve infinity while inside a doomed trunk—drives every micro-choice. Her renunciation of escape to finish the array is earned and costly, visible in the sweat-bead line. No diagnostic self-talk; perception stays sensory and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is vivified through concrete micro-choices—talking to the hopscotch board, cross-referencing runes, risking the dome activation—so motivation stays legible. Interiority is flavorful (“sociable isolation”) yet occasionally drifts toward performed self-narration, softening raw contradiction. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits lingering safety for ascent, earning a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s longing for his father’s lost rhythm is embodied in every micro-choice—selecting, fitting, uncapping—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction surfaces when nostalgia collides with the fear that the hall will merely mirror more loss. The final reassembly of the satchel shows a renunciation of pure replication and acceptance of improvisational repair; cost is the realization that no gear can resurrect the man, only the cadence. Closure choice is fully earned by the causal trail of tactile gear-work and mirrored memory.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The four survivors are sketched in one-line labels that never deepen; interiority is collective (“they”-mode) rather than individual. Lir’s altruism is asserted by chalk, not dramatized choice, so the ghost never feels like a character with stakes. The family’s final cohesion is declared, not tested under contradictory pressure, so the arc is smooth but not crucible-forged. Because no single psyche is followed, embodied emotion and micro-choice are diluted across the group.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s centuries-watch solitude and the lullaby vow are interior-consistent; the puppet-head touch micro-choices (tracing cracks, aligning eye with pane) externalize his motive under final pressure, earning the self-immolating closure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the arc is linear rather than torn, but the embodied cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s inheritor’s reluctance and the quiet atonement impulse are crisply embodied in his hunched fruit-picking and blueprint clutch. The “grudging motivation” line crystallizes contradictory wants (duty vs. self-preservation) and drives every nut-flick decision; the unseen rescue keeps the cost gnawing yet invisible, fitting Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak, just orchard grit and heart whirring like the birds’ gears. Final retreat to frost-laced orchard satisfies closure via stasis with cost: he will repeat the pain.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thorne’s guilt-driven interiority is convincingly embodied—kneeling, fingers tracing foam, pocketing the shell—yet the “symphonically minded” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory musical impulse undercuts his epiphany. The decisive shift from rigid polymers to dissolving foam-polymers is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he forfeits prestige and risks failure. Micro-choices (sketching in dirt, trembling at the bench) reveal value hierarchy, but the wife’s voice is imported summary rather than dramatized memory, softening the contradictory layering required for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory need to sell erasure while craving origin is dramatized through the ritualized counting of absences; the quantified voids externalize interior fracture, giving us embodied motive. The final surrender of the slate crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost—his vendor identity dissolves. Micro-choices (uncorking, pooling, incising) track a hierarchy that privileges origin over commerce. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elaris’s guilt-caravan backstory is anchored in sensory memory-flash, his tremoring hands over the sill externalize the internal cost, and the final self-absolution is earned by the iterative tasting-heating-absorption ritual; the “sandpaper” metaphor, however, is reiterated rather than deepened under pressure, keeping the flaw from compounding but preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “vigorous tender” resolve is dramatized through embodied action—hoisting the clock weight, climbing last, voice threading languages—so her drive feels lived-in. Interior contradiction is hinted (gentle librarian wielding cold lead) but never pressed to a moment where tenderness actually collides with ruthlessness; the cost is choral, not personal. Still, her micro-choices (releasing the plummeting weight, stepping center-bridge) foreclose retreat and earn the bridge’s talisman status. The absence of a private stumble or visible flaw keeps her just shy of 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. entropy—surface early and recur, but the interiority drifts into label-speak (“profound transformation,” “chaotically precise”) that blurs embodied contradiction. The archeologist motive is asserted repeatedly yet never tested against an external antagonist or relationship, so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. Micro-choices tilt the mirror in microns, a nice tactile beat, but the cost (lost sanity? lost corporate future?) stays conceptual. The ending’s vow is earnest but not constrained by any fresh flaw revealed in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s “prism-minded” trait is vividly interiorized—histories refract, archive spectra bloom—but contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choices (tilting the doodle, leaping upward) track with motive, yet the only visible cost is a blithe “latent blaze” that never scorches. The ending posture of poised mastery feels jumped-to because earlier beats show zero risk of archival failure or bodily harm; competence outruns struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—obsessive quest to re-voice the world vs. surrender to its hush—stay live in scene (he kneels, traces, hesitates, then strums). The final renunciation (pocketing the chip, walking away) costs him the grove’s nascent sound, a price felt in the closing hush. Micro-choices under pressure (threading silver, bowing quartz) reveal his hierarchy: music > self > silence. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific—thumb on the dent, knight-logic pacing—and his exile motive is viscerally tied to the pawn lesson that “exposed the court’s hidden fractures.” The final rearrangement of king to dent is a micro-choice that visibly costs him any chance of return, earning Earned Stasis. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only recalled, so the internal conflict is slightly under-dramatized. Still, the correlation tactic is inseparable from his tutor identity and carries a felt price at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s pacifist-archivist contradiction is vivid—war relics in hand while bandaging silence—but the diary is addressed more than handled; one embodied beat of him touching/clasping it under pressure would push this to 8+. Interiority is concrete, but the climax choice (tuning the clasp) is explained more than felt in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s sensory curse and ambition are viscerally embodied; the flower’s bloom forces a credible, costly shift from conquest to poise. Interior contradiction—yearning for wisdom while retching—plays out in scene, not summary. The final renunciation (no longer “ambitious conquest” but “harmony”) is earned by enduring the stench. Micro-choices (doodling while gagging, lashing the pot) reveal a value hierarchy under motion-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s grief-propelled quest is credible and embodied; the brother’s famine-death anchors every beat. Interiority stays concrete (“gaunt cheeks tightened,” “tip warm against her chest”). She acts under pressure—banking into the river-current, prying the conductor—each choice visibly narrowing risk. Only the final beat drifts toward convenient triumph rather than visible cost, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s drive—“cultivate foresight in action”—is declared early and threads every move; each anemometer placement is a micro-choice that embodies that motive. The patch is less a talisman than a mnemonic spur, but its stitching to his sleeve at the end shows a visible, irreversible cost: he now wears the dead engineer’s vigilance. Interiority stays concrete—wind data, not abstract guilt—though the moment he “visualizes the crash anew” edges toward summary rather than embodied contradiction. Still, the flaw is minor; the character’s competence is balanced by the story’s insistence that future crashes can only be averted if he stays permanently attuned to shifting air.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elyra’s motivation is cleanly stated (“burned … to certify wonder as essential”) and her synesthetic gift is embodied in every bell-stroke. Yet the interior contradiction—doubt versus wonder—is named rather than dramatized in real-time micro-choices; the moment she “struck” feels inevitable, not wrested from competing impulses. Earned cost is present—the amber sheet dims—but because the surrender to wonder is unopposed on the page, the change feels fore-ordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elaron’s grief-sharpened vigilance is viscerally embodied (“hands trembled not from cold”), and the micro-choice to plant driftwood markers fuses vocation with penance. Yet the interiority flirts with label-speak (“insights bloomed”) and the epiphany—failure rooted in isolation—feels announced rather than dramatized inside the spectral replay. A stronger contradiction under pressure would nudge him from competent to unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s chameleonic borrowing is dramatized in every beat—hands stained with star-dust, voice modulating to Mira’s tremor—so the trait drives the climax when her dread floods him. Interiority is concrete: “dread flooded his veins like molten topaz” embodies rather than labels. The final renunciation—releasing her personality—carries visible cost as the halo dims and the press resets, foreclosing his prior detachment. Micro-choices (pulling the lever while already half-stolen) reveal a hierarchy of obsession over self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s contradictory mix of chronic anxiety and salvific vocation is shown through body (twitching fingers still when the pendant activates) and micro-choice (offering the relic first to a stranger). The earned shift from “jittery courier” to “myth’s next verse” is legible, but Lira’s interiority is ventriloquised at the vision climax—Kael cannot know her childhood star-blades—so the relationship-as-crucible beat is slightly tainted.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s empiricist-mystic contradiction is embodied in every beat—he measures frost while whispering to mist, palms glass while denying ghosts—so the final forehead-to-window merger feels earned. The “attentive mystic” tag is never abstract: his pulse syncs with quartz, his prism warms in pocket, his notebooks lie. Cost is visible when he melts Eliza’s name and accepts the chassis-thrum of his father’s fists, foreclosing lifelong denial. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s mute longing is embodied in tactile loom-work and the amber bead, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“wistful,” “latent sacrifice”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the final weave; the trade of voice is backstory, not on-page conflict. The climactic surrender feels inevitable yet abstract—her “essence fray” is stated, not shown through bodily or emotional specificity—so the cost is legible but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s “quiet determination” is shown only in summary (“his actions remained deliberate”); the rubble-binding beat is the single on-page micro-choice that embodies the trait, so the arc is present but thin. The interior contradiction between meek surface and defiant fire is asserted repeatedly rather than dramatized in scene, so the “meaningful change” feels forecast rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—"cyclically spontaneous nature" and "sensory map maker" are concrete, embodied traits that steer every beat. The withheld-truth engine gives her a sharp contradiction: craving origin yet fearing collapse. Micro-choices (gripping the shard, twisting it twice) visibly escalate; the fused hand ending is earned. Flaw: mentor remains a thematic mouthpiece, not a full second character, so relationship crucible is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s reticence is credibly lived-in; every observed micro-choice (brushing the stone towers, pocketing the glass) reveals his hierarchy of values without a confessional interior monologue. The moment he pens his own note, the prior fifteen years of silence retroactively acquire cost—an earned shift. Harlan’s thinning frame and wet cough embody decline without diagnostic labels, keeping interiority concrete. Status dynamic is minimal yet legible: deliverer vs keeper, silence vs rasp, both men yielding a little at the end—enough to count as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s “shadowed elation” is vivid, but interiority drifts into label-speak (“tears of manic glee”) and the decisive turn—summoning shadows—rests on a vision rather than a prior flaw or contradiction. No micro-choice shows him weighing sailor-safety against godhood; the laughter stays performative, not revelatory of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. narrative hunger—are alive in every micro-choice (rotating the wing, folding it at the end). The donor-heart backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her tactics. Final renunciation—she will “illuminate wisely”—is earned by the fractal-map revelation with visible cost: the gift could kill her. Interiority stays concrete, dye-master idiom intact; no stock epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with “what trees witness” is embodied in callused hands and nightly dream-mapping, grounding interiority. The micro-choice to lift the sextant—feeling the numerals “press into his palms”—makes grief tactile and personal. No internal contradiction is staged, so the arc is more steady than crucible, yet the final smile is earned by accumulated ritual. The flaw: we never feel him tempted to abandon the quest; the cost is gentle, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to rekindle the dying realm is clear and emotionally embodied. The interiority—fragmented memories flickering like fireflies—creates a vivid, character-specific lens. The final choice to weave the dawns through song is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (pain lancing her temples). The transformation from fragmented keeper to dawn-weaver is credible, though the chorus of spectral voices slightly dilutes her personal agency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s regret-driven empathy is embodied in micro-gestures (smoothing cardigan, pocketing the invitation) and powers every beat; her “staying while leaving” choice crystallizes her internal contradiction. The young man’s hollow eyes and frayed invitation externalize her own past mistake, turning their brief encounter into a crucible that re-forges her identity. Cost is legible: she forfeits reclusive safety forever. Voice remains consistent, but one stock epithet (“compassionate recluse”) slightly dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet, observant guilt and micro-rituals (breaking the relic-loaf, nettle-pour) are embodied and specific; the moment he offers bread to Mira without speech crystallizes contradictory regret and hope. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the late backstory dump (“Their parents had run that bakery…”) tells summary lore that should have been dramatized pressure earlier. Forgiveness lands as credible Earned Stasis because prior avoidance is visible in every careful footstep; still, the single beat of reconciliation feels slightly rushed for 725 words, nudging the score down from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in every micro-gesture; the ledger freezing under his pen, the trembling gauge, the etched equation all dramatize a man whose identity is his method. The interior contradiction—orderly nature versus looming oblivion—remains active in scene, never abstract. Final smile is a credible renunciation: he accepts stewardship of a floating archive whose price is perpetual vigilance; cost is felt as the library drifts lower then rises again.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lila’s desire to “bottle” her father’s betrayal sound is dramatized through three escalating gambits, each with visible micro-costs (cracked voice, dropped fob, public exposure). The interior contradiction—vengeance vs. inherited outlaw pragmatism—stays embodied in the cool chain, racing pulse, and final wax-whirr rather than labels. Her final renunciation of the market’s hush is earned by prior causal beats; the price is the permanent exile encoded in dawn’s “uneasy quiet.” Only slight: the “curiously steadfast” label appears once un-dramatized, but the stance is otherwise lived.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied through her bioluminescent tattoos and refusal of neural implants, grounding her motivation early. Internal contradiction surfaces when her ring locks onto the mist-man—her skeptical stance collides with synesthetic awe. The final shift to wonder is earned: briny → honey taste sequence externalizes the cost of surrendering doubt. Minor drag: “luminous skeptic” is used once as label; micro-choices (climb, demand, join) stay sharp under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—accountant versus artist—is vividly embodied in his charcoal-stained fingers trembling under crystal light. The mnemonic gift is not label-only: it enables the lock-repair micro-surgery and powers the climactic moment when birth-date digits align. Flaw (denial of art) directly complicates the physical task; the cost is felt when yellowed sketchbooks spill out and he laughs without regret. The shift from trembling to laughter is credible because the causality is routed through the painstaking lock-fixing, not an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s wilting-under-lies trait is embodied early and governs her route; the mentor-reveal supplies credible internal contradiction and cost. Interiority stays concrete (“skin paling…color returning”) rather than therapeutic. The final choice—to share the vault quietly rather than weaponize it—grows from her established valuing of small candors, paying off her flaw without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—silent winter throat yet bell-voice yearning—drives every beat; the sculpture is her embodied speech. Her seasonal muteness isn’t label-only; it forces her to invent the kinetic bells, a credible workaround that costs her constant tuning as the iceberg melts. The final stance—she “prefers silence”—is an earned renunciation paid for by the prior frenzy of forging and the drip-by-drip thaw that keeps the wonder fragile. Micro-choices (threading wires like veins, stepping back to let wind conduct) keep hierarchy of values legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zeta’s nostalgic-robot interiority is concrete—vein-pulsing roses, childhood-fear box, servo strain—yet the emotional shift from static to “gentle static turned melody” is declared rather than embodied in a final micro-gesture; the earned cost is visible but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s curator trait is shown through her sorting eye and thrift-store cue, but her interiority stays at a general “quiet/calm” register; no contradictory impulse undercuts her calm, so tension stays external. The “sandstorm calm” label is repeated instead of dramatized bodily cost; tears from neighbors act as proxy emotion. Micro-choices (turning the dial, handing over the locket) align with motive, yet the climactic act feels procedural, not costly. Closure earns communal healing, but Elena’s personal stake/risk remains abstract—no path foreclosed for her.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—poet vs. tactician—shows in micro-choices like humming code through her rebreather; the “dice across his palm” reprise proves her renunciation of solitary genius is earned, with visible cost in the rising hull groans. Flaw balance holds: competence never eclipses cold-seep vulnerability. Only the AI’s ghost-recognition feels slightly convenient, nudging the cap.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s obsession with erased memories is clear from the first paragraph and drives every action; his embodied reactions to the gravity pockets and the heart’s visions feel tactile. The internal contradiction—clinging to fragile flowers while scraping salt shards—makes his values legible under pressure. No epiphany is declared; the final embedding of the heart is a renunciation of his old life that costs him visibility and ease, earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is sensuously concrete (“callused hands,” “tranquil blaze kindling in his chest”) and his contradictory fear of cosmic annihilation vs. hunger for stillness is on-page throughout. Micro-choices—pressing the paper wing into soil, tracing silence rings—are visible under pressure and foreclose the apocalypse at perceptible cost: he dissolves the wing and the prophecy both, ending in earned hush. No secondary character is present, so relationship/status tests are N/A. The only restraint from 9-band is that his flaws/limits don’t actively sabotage him; the struggle is more ritualized than psychologically perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s obsessive need to “hear” buildings is dramatized through concrete note-taking, late-night listening, and the climactic rooftop confrontation; the contradictory pull between scientific curiosity and occult surrender is felt in her tightening grip on Harlan’s wrist. Harlan’s guarded warmth and final capitulation are shown via the seal-transfer, not told—his patience and nimble dexterity visibly cost him the last barrier between tutor and initiate. Both characters read as specific oddballs, not archetypes, and their shared flaw—collusive secrecy—drives the final unveiling. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“her motive crystallized”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. charmed compliance—surface in every beat; the rune-etched skin, glowing tears, and trembling fingers externalize the split. The archive ritual is a micro-choice chain (kneel → trace → chant) that visibly costs sweat, light-flare, and pain. The final dimming of her glow proves the endurance has re-forged her; independence is earned, not declared. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—revenge turned self-release—is embodied in the thorn-prick scars and the slow unwriting of his own forgeries. The calibrated treason is shown, not labeled, through the ritual of blood-ink reversal. The final renunciation carries felt cost: the thorn becomes “of healing rather than harm,” a concrete reweighting of the talisman. One slip: “wisely enduring” is stated twice, a touch diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elyra’s contradictory impulse—hunger to know why echoes linger yet readiness to weaponize that knowledge—stays alive in every beat; her micro-choice to meter the shell’s whispers alters alliance tactics twice. Interiority is sensuously embodied (“reed-blown melancholy” tightening her throat) rather than labeled. The climactic renunciation—using her own echo as manacle—pays off prior causality with visible social cost (merchant entombed, oracle silenced). Flaw: the “richly perceptive” trait is asserted once too often, slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation (“ghost whisperer”) stays mostly interior monologue; we see calloused fingers but no diver reflexes under pressure. Child/locket motif supplies credible micro-choice that salvages “purity,” yet motives arrive pre-formed rather than emerging through new, stressful decisions. Interior contradiction is implied, not dramatized in-scene; still, the salvage yearning threads cleanly to the final locket grip, earning a modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kai’s interiority is concrete—callused palms, frothing bowl, matcha bitterness anchor his philosophy. The contradiction between mending nets and searching for invisible labor is dramatized in micro-choices (whisking, knotting, whistling). The final “quiet triumph” is earned: he foregoes sleep, finishes the net, tastes cold tea—cost is visible, motivation holds.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s investigative drive is sharply rendered through tactile beats—mask-fog, apple-juice, floorboard pry—each micro-choice exposing a contradiction between his truth-crusade and the orchard’s protective lie. The final renunciation gains weight because earlier fragments show creditors seizing Voss, so his silence now bears real cost. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse quickened,” “sweet on his tongue”) rather than abstract, embodying the split between debunker-identity and newfound guardian-role. Only minor slip: the instant rad-drop at the border feels slightly convenient, muting a beat where his body could register risk more contradictorily.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s isolation and monomania are vivid, but his interior contradiction— thrill at power versus fear of being consumed—arrives as abstract label (“he wondered if the dawn would blind or burn”) rather than an embodied, stake-shifting choice on the page. The beat where Mira sabotages and is instantly re-flipped by shadows is the sole moment that exposes cost to Elias, yet his reaction is summarized, not dramatized, so the renunciation/embrace feels only half-earned. Still, his perceptual lens (scavenged radios, storm-lit cobalt) is consistent and character-specific, keeping the score in high-mid band. Tightening the final cost into a visible micro-choice would push it past 8.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is richly lyrical and consistent; his “translator” compulsion is embodied in the jar-ritual, not told. Micro-choices (winding the box, tipping essences) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The final penny-and-tears beat shows earned cost, yet the grandmother’s instant tear feels slightly easy—more external confirmation than internal contradiction confronted. Flaws (solitude, self-doubt) compel action but stay safely sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—logical calculus versus raw ache—are dramatized in the sprint-to-tower beat; the key’s pulse against his palm anchors embodied emotion. The final calibration micro-choice visibly hierarchizes values: lover’s memory > personal survival. Cost is felt: trembling fingers, tear-tracked cheeks. Flaw: “logically emotional” is abstract self-label twice, not embodied; slight therapy-speak tinge keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—wild charge vs. mentor-engrained patience—surface in embodied micro-choices (scaling the viaduct while rehearsing moon charts). The final cut costs her the comfort of reckless identity, earning credible renunciation; however, Kai’s “softly purposeful” refrain drifts into label-speak twice, muting full interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—Elara’s empirical lens collides with fugitive visions—yet the “diagnostic” moment (“hallucination from fatigue, she reasoned”) flirts with label-speak. The phone-hurl earns its snap, but Marcus is only a text-cipher, so status pressure stays abstract. Lantern-as-talisman crystallizes her turn, yet Lila’s memories arrive fully formed, blunting the discovery cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s guilt is palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“guilt propelled him”) rather than embodied contradiction. The moment he watches the heart tick alive is a genuine micro-choice that crystallizes his vow, so change is earned. Still, the apology-to-action pivot is stated more than dramatized in-scene; we see the decision after the fact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s “steady curiosity” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—mounting the arrow tip, sketching circuits, installing the core—each action escalating risk. The interior contradiction between reverence and hubris peaks when she whispers “No one does… yet,” a charged renunciation that costs her innocence and forecloses a safe return to sea-level drudgery. No second character on page, so status crucible waived; motivation remains legible and causally tied to the closure bell.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s brightly-attentive trait is shown driving the anomaly hunt, but her interiority stays corporate-bland (“heart pounding in the sterile hum”) and the lie arrives as a single beat without prior contradictory impulse; cost is declared rather than dramatized in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thorne’s interiority is vivid—shadows “coiling from her sleeves” marries body to magic—but the dryad and wraith remain archetypes; their loneliness/withers are told via mirror glimpses rather than embodied choice, so the relational crucible never scalds. Her calm-intuitive trait is shown pacing the parley, yet the decisive act of reknitting the orb feels preordained by lyric premise, not hard-won under rising flaw. Cost is present—she pockets a now-laden orb—but the price is metaphysical, not personal, keeping the arc just shy of higher-stakes embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s obsessive need to “catch” the death-sound drives every move; her loosening grip on reality is shown through tactile attachment to the parasol tip and fearless volunteering on the ice. Contradictory impulses—yearning for death’s whisper yet reviving the near-dead woman—collide on-page, forcing a micro-choice that nearly costs the sound. The snapped lace’s drift-away crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak; Tomas’s secondary pressure is cleanly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—yearning for reconciliation yet sensing its futility—is kept alive in scene, not summary; her decision to walk to the pavilion grows from that tension. Theo’s “gently persuasive” stance is shown through gesture and wine-offer, not label. The burned-letter hand-off crystallizes a credible renunciation for both: she releases the city architect, he releases Clara, each at visible cost. Micro-choices (returning the fragment, rising at dawn) foreclose paths with felt scale adequate for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The “half-masked line walker” is sketched more as a ritual functionary than a psyche: we get his declarative motive (“preserve the echo”) but no interior contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His choices—conjuring clearings, peripheral gaze—are described in cinematic slow motion rather than felt stakes. The promised trait “strangely honest” is announced repeatedly yet never complicates or costs him anything on the page. At this length, one audible interior fracture would have been enough; instead the character stays a graceful mask.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s calm-perceptive trait is embodied through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, deliberate unclasping) and guides her puzzle-method; the interior contradiction between private grief and public curator role is implied but never dramatized in a beat of visible cost, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s reticence is shown through action—years of silence broken only by the crystal’s summons; her decision to testify costs her the safety of silence and is visibly paid in tears and cracked voice. Contradictory impulses (wonder vs. fear of sonic chaos) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—walking away after embedding her voice in the crystal—earns its poignancy because we have felt her struggle to speak at all.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s obsessive need to bottle “age’s voice” is viscerally embodied—his wire-threaded beard, chalk-dusted fingertips, the way he “clings to echoes” while crawling through fog. The precognitive-forgetful contradiction actively complicates every beat: each vision evaporates, forcing him to re-scribe, re-mark, re-try. The final image— chalk stub as “final tooth,” tape-loop playing in pocket— crystallizes a lifetime of erasure and reclamation. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; even the abstract “tidal longing” is rendered as salt on skin, marrow dust, recorder reels.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“luminous ache,” “heart pounding,” “sage intuition flaring”), not labelling. His tuning of the chronometer grows from decades-old tool empathy and loss of apprentices, giving the final micro-choices a felt cost. Internal contradiction is dramatized: reverence for mechanical eternity vs hunger for ephemeral starlight. The closure renunciation (leaf cradled, clock breathing with fragility) is earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s serene therapist persona is embodied through tactile micro-choices—cradling vinyl, uncorking vial—showing decisively kind drive. Interior contradiction is thin: she never doubts or hesitates, so the “flawless goodbye” feels gift-bestowed rather than wrested. Cost accrues to Harlan and Lena, but Elara’s own emotional price stays off-page, softening earned edge. Still, her calm agency cleanly motors every causal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet deliberation is the only trait that repeats; her interiority never cracks under pressure, so the promised “obsession” never manifests as visible irrationality or cost. The final smile is too tidy—no contradiction lingers, no bodily price paid—so the change feels administrative rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific bone-setter vs. granddaughter willing to try Grandma’s spell—drives every beat; the baby-tooth moment fuses vocation and belief with visible cost as she cracks her own certainty. “Shrewdly innocent” gait, calloused fingers, and herb satchel keep her profession alive in body and decision. Only a hairline slip: the final village-lamb plan is told, not dramatized, so the renunciation’s price is implied rather than felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s earthbound vigil and her vow to lost kin anchor every beat; the interior contradiction—“yearning sky yet choosing ground”—is alive in each micro-choice (polishing, presenting the gem). Emotions stay embodied in salt-stung fingers and weighted glass, never slipping into label-speak. The final renunciation—sharing light while remaining rooted—carries visible cost as she hands over the captured starlight and stays ashore. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority is coherent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—public shame vs. private need to graft meaning—are shown through her quiet act of offering the pendant; Kai’s parallel pain is sketched quickly but credibly. The pendant transfer is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses retreat for both, paying a small interpersonal cost on the spot. Interiority stays concrete (“amber warm as trapped sunlight”), avoiding label-speak. Voice convergence under stress is minimal; the relationship crucible functions.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s desperation is palpable, but his interiority lapses into rhetorical flourishes (“dying heart,” “splintered ambitions”) that tell rather than embody. The seashell ritual is a concrete micro-choice, yet the solemnizing vow is repeated with identical cadence four times, flattening character specificity. No contradictory impulse complicates the ritual; each cameo submits without resistance, so the arc is accumulation, not transformation. Closure reaches Earned Stasis—he leaves whole—but the cost is atmospheric, not psychologically individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “dancing over gears,” laughter “a soft chime”—and her motive (restore sacred practices) is anchored to concrete memory of grandmother’s songs. The micro-choice to begin singing under moon-dawn alignment turns the loom; that act is embodied, not abstract. No contradictory impulses are staged in real time, so the “internal conflict” bullet is only weakly met; the cost is communal, not personal, blunting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lir’s interiority is concrete—heartbeat-counting, palm-on-frost, knuckles blanching—culminating in the Earned Stasis of kneeling inside the sealed star-map. The only drag is near-total isolation: no second character on stage to force status choices, so relationship crucible is absent by default, not error.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s solitary obsession is vivid—callused fingers, peripheral gaze, the recursive harvesting of his own doubts—yet the interior contradiction never sharpens into a single, wrenching micro-choice that costs him something tangible on the page. The final ascent is serene rather than stung; we feel no forfeiture attached to the now-brimming timer, so the arc lands as accomplished, not paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—collecting intangible weights—remains abstract; we never see a micro-choice where a specific burden’s mass alters her next weave. The interior contradiction (panic vs. vocation) is asserted, not embodied in gesture or breath. Final calcification reads as imposed ritual, not earned character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile woodworking and memory-crystals; the interior contradiction between holding and releasing Theo is alive in every chisel stroke. The final act of snapping the locket shut is a credible micro-choice that seals her path, with the kettle’s shriek as audible cost. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract catalogue (“here and gone” repeated as label) which flattens peak beats −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the carousel rail while craving grounded rest—are dramatized in scene via the camera-crank beats; the final renunciation of the wheel is foreshadowed by each fragment he reels in, so the choice is earned. Interiority stays concrete (“callused hands refusing surrender,” “breath caught”). Ghost-Elias pressures him with visible cost, forcing the micro-choice to offer the wheel; the pact’s uncertainty is felt. No stock labels; the erosion metaphor is lived, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “functionally creative” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (sextant alignment, panel splicing) that carry visible cost—her steady hands despite fatigue, the risk of overload. Interiority stays concrete, but the arc is thin: she wants “equations for hope” yet never confronts an internal contradiction or sacrifice; the only cost is off-page stamina. The result is competent, not crucible-level transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s introversion and gentle precision are credibly embodied in every micro-gesture; the contradictory ache for melody versus the safety of gears is active in-scene, not summarized. The moment he kneels and lingers on the music box shows micro-choice under pressure that hierarchizes nostalgia over silence. The renunciation-to-renewal arc is earned because the forecourt’s whispers literalize the cost of reclaiming sound. Interiority stays concrete, but two near-label phrases—“introverted soul,” “abandoned dream”—slip into diagnostic shorthand, clipping the last increment to 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—rational skeptic vs. hunger for myth—stays active in-scene and powers the salvage choice. Embodied emotion (“pulse quickened,” “cool ooze”) is specific, not labeled. Final renunciation of chase is earned via the sundial inscription that reweights motive; cost is quiet but legible. Motivation remains character-bound; no knowledge leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s “infinite patience” is stated more than dramatized; the only micro-choice—offering to help with the rope—comes late and costs him nothing. Kael’s shift from gruff to cooperative is asserted, not forced by visible status moves. Interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“philosophy unfurling like kelp”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final pact to teach the boy lands as gift, not sacrifice, so the closure lacks felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his voyeuristic hunger for absence versus his ache to stitch presence back—are dramatized in every beat (pressing the thread to lips, binding it to wrist). The renunciation of permanent departure is earned: he chooses the garden’s living archive over endless wandering, paying the visible cost of tearing the weft and leaving the journal behind. Interiority stays concrete, never slides into therapy-speak. Micro-choices (kneeling, tasting, tucking the frayed thread into the spine) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elarion’s gaunt scavenger-prince persona is vivid; his compulsive hypothesizing is embodied in trembling hands and whispered what-ifs, not merely labeled. The internal contradiction—yearning for beauty while expecting flaw—drives every micro-choice, culminating in the tearful embrace of a stunted chick that crystallizes his earned stasis. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; isolation itself becomes the crucible. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost (palace quake, flawed bird) is felt more environmentally than as a personal, body-level forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—burn grafts, callused hands, the weight of the foreign coin against fresh bark—so her compassion reads as lived, not declared. Contradictory impulses (saving what her father tried to erase) stay active in-scene through the graft act itself. The final renunciation of paternal shadow is earned because the graft literally binds her scar to the land’s. Only minor slippage: “unyielding compassion” is once label-speak near the end, blunting full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s skepticism flickers only in the single rhetorical question about sorcery; otherwise her interiority is cosmic lyricism that could belong to any luminous pilgrim. The lack of micro-choice under pressure—everything is patient waiting—means no hierarchy of values is tested. Cost accrues to the city, not to her stance; she is unchanged, merely the witness who lifts a lid. The arc is city-centric, not character-centric, so at this length the motivation feels observational rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—sentimental elegy vs. calculated sabotage of the loop—are palpable in her embodied handling of the gear and the throne-embedding. Micro-choice at the core (halting, embedding, retreating) visibly forecloses her prior stance of detached observation, paying the cost of perpetual vigilance. The maternal memory is concrete (“whispering prophecies that drove her clutch to madness”), not label-speak, and her form literally dimming shows embodied emotion. Only minor drift: “otherworldly sentimentalist” risks abstract label, but is re-grounded each time petals echo personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority pulses through every beat, his chisel-carver’s need to “discover the shape of collective grief” is never abstracted; each dusk return is a micro-choice that accrues cost in fatigue and solitude. The contradiction between his stone-cold craft and the fragile butterfly swarm is lived, not declared. When he finally sees the ribbon’s weave as grief’s form, the realization is embodied in the tears that “carved paths down his cheeks,” a visible price that forecloses his old way of seeing. No stock epiphanies; his final outward gaze is earned stasis, charged with the quiet thunder he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt-riven diligence is viscerally embodied—callused fingers on stone, heart hammering with surf—but the “ethically diligent heart” label is repeated rather than shown in micro-choice. The sabotage memory is a vivid contradiction, yet the later penance is delivered in montage, not in a single pressured scene; we are told he “aided orphans” instead of watching one beat where a child’s need collides with his clock obsession. Interiority is mostly lyric-summation (“searing reverie,” “fractured spirit”) rather than moment-to-moment vacillation; still, the final smile feels earned because the rake-handle ledger dramatizes a lifetime of minute payments. The flaw is not fatal, but at this length the absence of one live, conflicted present-tense choice keeps him a hair below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s blithe temperament is consistently shown through humming and tender gestures, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “contented sigh” feels unearned because no micro-choice visibly costs him anything. The tapestry decoding is presented as foregone success, so agency under pressure is muted. Still, the gardener’s perceptual filter is vivid and occupation-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his doubt “clawed,” his heart “pounding”—and the contradiction between mapping ignorance and needing secrecy is active in scene. Micro-choices (recalibrating the model, steadying the quill) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final smile before the pen lands shows credible endurance with cost: discovery imminent, path locked in. No relationship crucible on page, so secondary-pressure bullet waived; solo-POV limits voice distinction test.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s vocation and obsession are vividly etched; every micro-choice—quill angle, dial twitch—springs from her need to re-animate narrative dust. Interior contradiction is alive: rebellion vs. self-erasure, precision vs. yearning. The single on-page renunciation—shutting the dial at dawn—carries visible fatigue and the implicit cost of ongoing pursuit, earning her stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory need both to preserve and to destroy his mother’s memory is dramatized through the embodied ritual of sketching, burning, grinding, and scattering. Interiority stays concrete (“mask weighed heavier now, its shards a reminder that safety was but porcelain pretense”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—baring his face and preparing to serve the next seeker—earns its cost through the prior cascade of ash and doubt. Only minor slip: the mother’s remembered “arguments” are asserted rather than shown, a small flattening in an otherwise sharp arc.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Interiority is razor-sharp and character-bound: “cog clutched tight, silt caking his beard” fuses thought, body, and tool. Motive is relentlessly dramatized—every sift of ash tests his “preserve time” creed; final fusion of cog-frame carries visible cost in scraped knuckles and irreversible stance. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs rational defiance) coil inside single beats, never abstract labels. The earned stasis—he will confront, not convert—radiates cost: exile from both sewer safety and surface communion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; her “traveled stillness” and “expectantly resigned” stance are repeated labels rather than embodied contradiction. The militiaman, merchant, and scholar are sketched by past labels, not on-page choices under pressure. No micro-choice shows Elara risking or forfeiting anything; the closure feels observational rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s synesthetic gift and gentle-rebel ethos are vivid, but the interiority drifts into label-speak (“synaptic plasticity,” “neural spark”) that blunts embodied contradiction. The pruning micro-choices track, yet the climactic taste-of-potential is narrated rather than dramatized, so the cost feels declared, not tasted. Still, his calm stubbornness and the final whispered vow earn a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curse creates immediate, embodied tension in every line he speaks; the contradiction between involuntary candor and his yearning to protect wonder is dramatized, not labeled. The lacquer-box workaround shows a hierarchy of values—truth vs. wonder—paid for with the heirloom itself. Mira’s spark-dimmed weariness is concrete in her grease streaks and coin-slap, and her choice to climb reframes her identity from tech to quest. Cost is visible: Elias loses the box, Mira risks the tower; the final smile is earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically specific—he “watches the bay’s houses transform” and “seeks the hidden rhythm”—but the contradiction between creeping-loss obsession and later communal savior turn is asserted rather than embodied in scene. Embodied emotion peaks when he pockets the orris shard (“weight as more than stone”), yet the climax relocates the locket without dramatizing a micro-choice that costs him anything personal. The shift from detached observer to ritual orchestrator feels convenient; no prior flaw or limit foreshadows the risk or price of this new agency. Still, his perceptual signature is sustained, and the final smile carries a faint earned residue of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—bubbles from her gills, fists clenched against “villainy in her bloodline”—and her contradictory impulses (rage vs. need for truth) play out in real time. The final shift from vengeance to resolve is earned by the three telepathic revelations, each tightening the moral cost. Thalor’s “incisively kind” telepathy acts as secondary pressure, forcing micro-choices that visibly tilt her stance. Only minor loss: ancestor remains off-page, so the bloodline shame is abstract; still, the garden’s living relics embody the legacy she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—grim optimism—stays active: he “muttered…yet he pressed on,” balancing calculation with reckless proof. The chipped die as regret-engine and missed-leap texture are handled in micro-choice (rolling to pick equation paths), tying flaw to tactic. Final renunciation—pocketing lone die, smiling darkly—earns its cost via rupture failure. Balanced daring could be more viscerally tested; proof scenes lean cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s sleeplessness, trembling fingers, and “methodically hopeful” stance are embodied in every micro-choice; the brush tremor and saffron ink set-up pay off in the final surrender to drowsiness, showing a credible, earned swing from exhaustion to fragile peace. Contradictory impulses—doubt vs. the need to believe—coexist inside single strokes of the brush, never collapsed into tidy self-diagnosis. The only minor safety-hedge is the faintly lyrical distance in the final curl-among-pots image, but the cost of prolonged insomnia is felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s “museum-guide” persona never surfaces in speech or staging—no tour-script cadence, no performative pedagogy; she acts as generic leader, not culture-shaper. The opera lens is clutched but never tested by contradiction or micro-choice; its emerald tint is noticed, not lived. Interiority is ornamental (“rosewater dread perfumed the air”) rather than body-felt. Motivation rescues arts yet the on-page cost is collective flight, not personal renunciation, so the final “vanishing into legend” feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—hands polishing gears, skin tightening over bones—but the “cursed star” and “doomed bloodline” remain abstract labels; no contradictory on-page impulse complicates his leap to self-sacrifice. The final husk-image is earned, yet motive stays monolithic: defy fate because fate says so. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, smash lens) align, but we never see him hesitate or bargain, so the renunciation feels pre-scripted rather than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory hunger for self-erasure and survival is embodied in every beat—her grip on the clasp, her voice cracking as she weaponizes shame. The suicide-failure confession is dramatized, not labeled, and the final laugh shows a credible moral slide. Micro-choices (hurling the clasp, pocketing the note) visibly cost her future innocence. Interiority stays sensorily anchored; no stock “I feel” labels.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen’s motivation is vivid—turning peril into prophecy—but interior contradiction is asserted (“restlessness gnawed”) rather than dramatized in split-second choice. The final leap-and-dub is earned, yet the cost (tattoo flare, slump) is stated more than felt. No second character on page, so relational crucible waived; micro-choices (sketching, lashing debris) align with motive and supply visible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is vivid in her workshop and in her risky climb, yet her interior contradictions stay summary-level; we see resolve, not simultaneous dread or guilt. The final stumble is earned, but the micro-choice that tips her from mapper to doom-bringer happens offstage in the whistle sequence, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s “emotional rationality” is dramatized in the tunnel: silent tears while logging gas-shipment proof—body and ledger in one beat. Micro-choice to enter ivy-choked tunnel (danger) versus satchel-safe letter (duty) crystallizes hierarchy of values. Grandfather link supplies personal cost, but the beat is summary not scene, blunting embodied contradiction. Closure choice (publish) is foreshadowed, yet feels inevitable rather than costly because no external obstacle tests it on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic endurance vs. aching sensitivity—are embodied in every underwater repair; the ancestral names “Lira & Thorne” carve a credible flaw into his mission. Micro-choices (widening a crack to read more, sealing a note while lungs burn) keep interiority concrete. The final renunciation—empty inkwell, solitary shore—pays the cost of his obsession in visible solitude. Only a hairline slip: the tears “lost to the flood” flirt with label-speak, not quite embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s drive to find “honest origins” stays legible throughout; her tactile micro-choices (kneeling, re-inking, tracing coordinates) embody the indexer mindset. The interior contradiction—steady resolve vs. flicker of doubt—surfaces only once; more layering would lift this to 9+. Closure cost is present but quiet; she seals the vault having forfeited the mythic comfort she once catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elar’s interiority is vivid—grief as luminous agony, the need to fold that grief into cranes—but the “crafty” trait is asserted more than enacted; we see artisan precision yet little cunning. His contradictory impulses (rise to the isle / fall into abyss) are felt, and the final renunciation of weight earns its cost. Still, the absence of any second character mutes status dynamics and secondary pressure, keeping this just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Survivor trauma is anchored in concrete sensory scars and the geode relic; every micro-choice (sealing the crystal, ignoring the rebooting console) is driven by the “harvest the void” motive. Interiority stays specific—shrapnel itch, recycled air—never drifting into therapeutic self-label. The final stance crystallizes earlier motives with visible cost: she is now “sovereign of the unseen,” foreclosing any return to ordinary grief. Just shy of 9 because the groom/family remain abstract counters, not fully individuated memories that collide in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s ache of orphan-belonging is palpably threaded through her micro-choices (launching drones, lever pull); the pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” face is shown but never motivates any on-page decision, so his arc is passive decoration. Their relationship never becomes a crucible—no status shift or mutual pressure—so the emotional cost lands only on her side. Still, her internal contradiction (pilot vs. dreamer) is dramatized and paid for in the final image, satisfying the earned-change test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt and self-loathing are viscerally rendered through the driftwood search and watch-hand moment; the mirrored maternal memory gives interior contradiction sharp teeth. Micro-choices (kneel, sift, pocket, rise) externalize the ethical turn cleanly. Still, the epiphany is stated more than dramatized—“tempered regret became clarity” tells us the shift rather than letting the image alone do it, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt-driven need to recycle betrayal into diplomacy powers every beat; the drawer-pull apology is embodied, costly, and alters her brother’s fate. Interiority stays concrete (“antique drawer pull…freed was her conscience”). Micro-choice hierarchy visible: relic first, brother second, self last. Voice never slips into label-speak; flaw remains active to final arm-clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-loathing versus defiant hope—are alive in every paddle stroke; the merrily-melancholic laugh is an embodied tic that costs him lungfuls of brine. His micro-choice to pocket the shattered compass and later to beach under the eighteenth pole crystallizes a value hierarchy: penance over pride, instinct over instrument. The final whispered mantra “Heart leads; follow” is earned because the utility-pole method has just validated his internal compass at visible risk. Cap held at 8.7 because the backstory Reflection exceeds 20 % without always feeding immediate on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    Jax’s interior contradiction—guilt clawing through engineered amnesia—remains vivid; the baseball functions as a concrete memory cue that forces micro-choices (descend, offer, confess). Elara’s “walking void” is shown only through the single tear; we don’t see her contradictory impulses in scene, so the empathy rekindling feels declared, not dramatized. The final stance is legible and costly: he forsakes the clean slate for a fragile shared future. Voice convergence under stress is minor but keeps this out of the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s grief is vivid, but interiority slips into label-speak (“severance clawed at her soul”). The metamorphosis choice is telegraphed early yet still feels abrupt because the fortune’s imperative overrides visible internal debate; contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of transformation. Earned cost is present—she loses human form—but the beat is compressed into one sentence, muting the emotional punch needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lirien’s interior contradiction—cartomancer who once devoured time now bleeding to return it—drives every beat; her trembling unfastening of bodice and later of saucer hinge shows embodied cost. The micro-choice to wind the stolen clockwork into her daughter’s swaddle crystallizes a maternal values hierarchy on the page. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli (ink, moss, milk scent) and alters options; flaw (hubris of foresight) complicates rather than sermonizes. Cost is visible: blood loss breath, “velvet noose tightening with forgiveness,” and the tick now fused to infant breath—earned stasis that forecloses retrograde meta-vision.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifist code is interiorly alive: every beat pivots on refusing harm while still craving action. The micro-choice to “extend a phantasmal hand” toward her own rage embodies the contradiction. No secondary character adds pressure, so the crucible is internal and sustained. Closure is earned: her levity is the direct physiological cost of integrating shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically sustained—“texture of transformation” recurs—but contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized. The giving obsession is vivid yet never genuinely tested; no moment forces him to withhold or regret a gift, so change is atmospheric, not earned. His passivity at the climax (wind uncorks bottles) leaves motivation ornamental. Cap at 6.9 because the arc lands as lyrical stasis rather than costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s calmly inventive vigilance is dramatized through tactile beats—aligning quill prongs, pocketing the crystal—each micro-choice tethered to her quiet revolutionary motive. Interior contradiction is light; the voice risks over-articulate self-explanation (“her motivation burned quiet”) but body-tool choreography mostly compensates. Earned stasis is present: she replaces the smudge, accepting continued risk. Cost is felt but not sharpened to a wound; still, the stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s slippery elusiveness is lived-in: he “slipped away like his charges,” steers by precog flashes that hurt, and the final laugh shows earned release. Interiority stays concrete—visions “splinter nights like shattered glass”—and the micro-choice to keep placing stones while foreseeing collapse gives visible cost. The only drag is slight over-articulation of pattern-understanding at the very end; a hairline slip but closure still feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—rage at censorship vs. surrender to communal mapping—are dramatized in the moment he re-seals the envelope; the psychic cost of betrayal and the jagged rib scar body these impulses. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final micro-choice (descending with the timetable) locks an earned, visible cost. The only bar to 9+ is that the “communal scar map” realization is slightly abstract; the body-level cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voss’s interiority is vivid—“questions into destinations” creed—but the rival Lang never individuates beyond stock foil; mechanical arm clicks reliably yet no contradictory impulse complicates his stance. The alliance turn is abrupt, lacking micro-choice foreshadowing; Lang’s yielding feels convenient, not costly. Earned stasis needs on-page cost; instead, blades are sheathed and partnership embraced without residue of rivalry. Interior tension is performed, not embodied under blade-stress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s monthly “molt” gives a vivid, embodied contradiction—poet vs. architect—that drives every on-page choice; the moment he shelves Rilke beside Whitman while ash drifts off his coat shows interiority in action. Mira’s first whispered question instantly pressures his reflexive reinvention, turning the library into a crucible where status shifts (ex-librarian vs. ex-street poet) are legible in gesture and book-handling. The friendship’s cost is felt when next-month’s self already “looms,” implying future loss, but the beat where he tucks “blooming resistance” into the tin could use one more micro-choice that actually hurts. Overall, motives escalate cleanly and personalities stay particular, yet the arc leans on summary toward the end rather than a final embodied decision that seals the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning vs. strategic resolve—are dramatized in the piano-to-climb sequence; the final renunciation of passive grief is earned by the reel-driven ascent and costs him bodily risk, visible in the crevice-wedge moment. Interiority stays concrete (“heart clenched with steely longing”) rather than diagnostic. The broken clock’s re-winding embodies the change; no safety-hedging apology for sentiment. Motivation scales cleanly from nostalgic ache to life-risking action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motive to “protect cultural memory” is stated early and re-iterated, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the dream-library sequence shows her observing, not choosing under conflicting impulses, so the final vow feels appended, not earned. No embodied emotion beyond lyrical labels (“heart luminous yet laced with doubt”). Micro-choice at the seed-planting beat is purely procedural; stakes rise only in summary. Closure cost is asserted (“doubt lingered luminous”) rather than paid in visible action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to regret while yearning for release—play out in every micro-choice (snipping regret-laden twigs, breathing apologies into mist). Interiority stays concrete: salt-spray rawness, compass-needle quiver in her chest, tears diffusing into rain-damp ground—never diagnostic labels. Hiroshi functions as pressure-source rather than sage, his slow-spoken cadence forcing her to metabolize silence into action; status shift is legible when she accepts the lace rather than more instruction. Final Charged Poise is earned: the cerulean shade she sought becomes the exact sky she now carries away—cost visible in tears and the compass hum she’ll keep hearing.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation—stripping drama from cosmic phenomena—is vividly embodied in her scientific ethos and mirrored in her greenhouse observations. Her internal contradiction (craving grand discovery vs. embracing quiet decay) manifests through concrete choices: capturing butterflies, dusting mirrors, building a spectrometer. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from “chasing spectacle” to “embracing gradual” feels swift given the trauma of losing her observatory. The final humility is earned but lacks a visible misstep or resistance that would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking purpose in pauses—is compellingly tied to her art and backstory, and her “steadily adaptive” trait manifests in embodied choices (e.g., evading the blade, reading frost). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her resolve feels unwavering rather than wrestled. The ledger’s emotional weight is clear, but her transformation leans toward epiphany over struggle. Final renunciation of vengeance is earned, though the moral cost feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in loss and embodied through tactile choices—clutching the case, pressing her palm to glass, guiding Kai’s hand. Her internal conflict (grief vs. creation) manifests physically without therapy-speak. Kai’s scarlet heat map reveals layered emotion, not caricature. However, his transformation leans slightly swift; the buried green core of love feels asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his weariness, stubbornness, and yearning for silence manifest through tactile interaction with the lens and environment. His motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses his physical existence but fulfills his deepest desire. The trait “inadvertently stubborn” isn’t just stated; it drives micro-choices (ignoring lung pressure, pressing into impossible spaces) with escalating cost. His transformation into the beacon feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying Earned Stasis with profound emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her desire to forge intergenerational resilience through anonymous giving. Her gently persistent trait manifests in embodied choices—kneeling beside Tomas, organizing runs—that carry visible cost under sanctions. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are shown through silver hair catching starlight or steady hands lifting the bell. The only limitation is minor flattening in secondary characters like Lena, whose arc leans slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in a past-life vow and embodied through his camera obscura practice—is consistent and intensifies credibly when he meets Mira. His spiritually curious trait drives micro-choices (e.g., pressing Kwan Yin’s tear into the pinhole) that reveal hierarchy of values. Mira’s wound and breath become crucibles for mutual transformation, with their relationship altering by story’s end. However, her interiority remains thin; she functions more as catalyst than co-agent, slightly weakening reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to touch time’s texture—is vividly embodied and drives every action, from pruning hedges to wielding the halo fragment. His retrocognitive torment feels visceral, not diagnostic, especially in the crumbling photographs that bind him to loss. The final renunciation of the past is earned through escalating tactile struggle, not epiphany. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—grief and obsession alternate rather than collide in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with clear stakes. Her “patiently strategic” nature manifests in micro-choices—decoding keys, using chains as tools—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, interior contradiction remains underexplored; her emotional state leans toward singular focus without layered conflict or self-doubt. The final renunciation of captivity feels earned, but the cost is more physical than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—forging a hearing aid that captures the sound of betrayal—is vividly rooted in trauma and sensory synesthesia, driving every action with emotional urgency. His internal conflict between grief and invention manifests through embodied detail (scarred hands, mitotic fire) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t of love but of passive suffering; he transforms memory into tool, foreclosing victimhood at tangible cost. However, his partner exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible depth expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to press her ear against destiny’s door—is vividly embodied and drives every action, culminating in a credible reconfiguration of self. Her “quietly savvy” trait manifests in micro-choices (decoding bouquets, tilting the moonbeam jar) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict simmers between theft-as-quest and fear of exposure, though emotional embodiment occasionally leans lyrical over visceral. The final renunciation of mere stealing for wielding light feels earned, with opportunity cost legible in her flight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and aspiration, with interiority filtered through poetic narration. However, his emotional shift from isolation to communal yearning occurs without sufficient friction—no resistance, doubt, or failed attempt tempers the thaw. The “cracked leather bookmark” functions more as talisman than catalyst for internal contradiction. His final resolve feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice that visibly costs him something irretrievable.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s phobias and “firmly adaptive” trait drive concrete choices—leaping despite terror, using rust-dust as camouflage—and her final lunge over the cliff embodies vulnerability-as-power. However, Harlan’s motivation remains underdeveloped; his confession feels functional rather than psychologically inevitable. The shell’s magic slightly undermines interior causality by externalizing decryption. Still, Elara’s trembling certainty is embodied, not declared, and her arc earns its closure through physicalized risk.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The oracle’s “mild obsession” is consistent but under-pressurized; his motivation lacks internal contradiction or tangible cost. Elara’s desperation is vividly embodied, yet her arc resolves through passive reception rather than active choice. Their interaction reveals status (oracle as cryptic guide, Elara as supplicant), but no relationship evolution occurs. The final micro-choice—Elara clutching the map—is credible but minimally dramatized, lacking a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The robot janitor’s motivation—seeking the origin of thought—is embodied through precise micro-choices (playing the violin, resisting overload) that reveal a hierarchy of values: janitorial duty grounding mystical revelation. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, cognition emerges via sensor calibration, looped timelines, and tactile interaction with the violin. His “remarkably composed” trait isn’t stated but demonstrated under escalating pressure, culminating in Earned Stasis: sweeping resumes, now infused with hard-won wisdom. The final cost—loss of the violin, acceptance of cyclical labor as consciousness—is felt without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s mistrust and Elias’s quiet resolve are embodied through consistent micro-choices—her hesitant steps, his ledger-closing renunciation—but interiority occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“mistrust etched like cracks in ice”) rather than concrete contradiction. The final embrace feels earned, yet Elias’s motivation lacks friction; his eavesdropping yields insight without moral cost or struggle, softening the emotional stakes. Mira’s arc resolves cleanly, though her epiphany borders on diagnostic (“I hid to protect, but it froze me”). Still, their transformation emerges credibly from accumulated gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s pragmatic interiority is embodied in tactile actions—polishing marbles, binding vines—not abstract declarations. His contradiction (scorn for luck yet ritual devotion to small victories) drives every choice. The final renunciation of the council’s fatalism feels earned through accumulated micro-choices with visible cost: his cracked orb, his weathered body, his solitary labor. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in bark-dry skin and deliberate strokes of oiled chamois.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her obsession with sideways time, embodied through her mechanic’s warmth and precise micro-choices (e.g., weaving nexus schematics into drone repairs). Her interior contradiction—obliging exterior vs. burning intellectual need—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. Dr. Lirren functions as effective secondary pressure, though his role remains minimal. Final renunciation of validation for proof feels earned, with cost implied in years of dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—deciphering his great-aunt’s ghostly code—is rooted in personal history and intensifies credibly under pressure. His micro-choices (slashing the lantern chain, prying the grate) reveal a hierarchy of values: legacy over safety, revelation over preservation. Interiority is embodied (“bow trembling,” “heart raced”) without diagnostic labels, and his transformation from “lately inspired” to “ignited” feels earned. However, Elara’s spectral presence borders on convenient validation rather than active crucible, slightly weakening relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—sweat-soaked sheets, trembling fingers, charcoal crumbling—and her contradictory impulses (resilience vs. guilt, peripheral awareness vs. need for clarity) act simultaneously in scene. Her motivation intensifies credibly from fever-haze to reckoning with a swallowed truth that cost a life. The final renunciation—accepting burden rather than lifting it—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, the cartographer exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jax’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his skepticism wars with dawning guilt, embodied in tactile details like the beads’ “unnatural smoothness.” His final choice to turn the valve is earned by prior causality: his anonymous call confesses what his tampering wrought. The cost—thirteen lives, including his brother’s—is viscerally legible, not abstract. His reckoning feels individual, not archetypal, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness even in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—witnessing change without judgment—is consistent and embodied through tactile, sensory actions (e.g., unfolding the swan, folding his cloak). His internal state remains coherent, though interior contradiction is minimal; he acts more as a vessel than a conflicted agent. The “loose grip on reality” trait enables his burrowing but lacks visible trade-offs that complicate choice. Final endurance feels earned but leans toward passive observation over active renunciation with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and deeply felt, rooted in personal loss and professional ethos. Lila’s arc from silence to whispered speech feels earned through embodied reactions (clutching the backpack, tracing roots). However, her transformation leans slightly on symbolic convenience—the locket transfer lacks sufficient friction or resistance to fully dramatize internal conflict. The final smile mirrors Elias’s “cautious exuberance” too neatly, softening the cost of her re-engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s motivation is vividly rooted in his perceptive oddness, and his micro-choices—pressing ears to walls, salvaging diaries—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preserving memory against oblivion. His internal contradiction (collecting dreams in a dreamless world) pulses throughout without resolution, culminating in Earned Stasis: he accepts his role as eternal listener. However, the final beat (“a dreamless man dreaming through stone”) risks diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—yearning to “transpose life into a new key”—is rooted in consistent traits (observer turned actor) and intensifies credibly under pressure. His internal conflict (solitude vs. agency) manifests through embodied choices: pocketing the film, baking altered cookies, manipulating the lighthouse beam. The final renunciation of passive anonymity is earned by prior causality, with visible cost (risking exposure, altering his identity). However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from chuckling observer to shadow puppeteer lacks friction or doubt mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to expose the shadow’s flawed assumption about stillness—is clear, consistent, and intensifies through his rhetorical and painterly actions. His interiority is embodied in tactile choices (palette, pedal) rather than abstract musing, though emotional contradiction remains underexplored. The final renunciation of silence as passive illusion feels earned, with visible cost: an empty palette, eternal quiet. However, the lack of internal struggle beyond conviction slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—chronological homesickness and the desire to conduct unheard symphonies—is vividly embodied through tactile memory-mapping and shell-conducting, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her interior contradiction (longing vs. creative agency) acts simultaneously in scene, especially during the climactic summoning of memories under physical duress. The final renunciation of fortune cookies as mere paper slips is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: exhaustion, collapse, and transformation of craft. However, the ethereal boy’s appearance slightly softens the emotional rigor by offering external validation rather than pure internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to conquer the labyrinth of self—is vividly embodied through his defiance of gravity and retracing of timelines, with clear interior contradiction (defiance vs. fear). His micro-choices (e.g., choosing differently in the fall memory) reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. However, emotional embodiment occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“burning motivation,” “fragmented past”) that borders on label-speak. The final integration of his shadow-self is earned by prior causality and carries resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through tactile reconnection—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly. Her micro-choices (mending the needle, cranking backward) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking ridicule, investing fragile hope. Interiority is embodied (“vibrations humming through stone and skin”) without diagnostic label-speak. The relationship with Thorne functions as crucible, his tears mirroring her breakthrough, though secondary characters remain lightly sketched yet pressure-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her meticulousness, curiosity, and commitment to integrity shape every micro-choice. Her emotional state is embodied (“unease prickling her skin,” “pulse steadied”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (choosing solitude over reporting) forecloses a path with visible cost: isolation in the face of encroaching chaos. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in specific, embodied grief—his scarf, trembling hands, and the vial all externalize inner conflict. His aromatically cautious trait creates tangible tension, and his final inhalation marks a credible, costly shift. However, the emotional arc leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“neural phantoms,” “neurotransmitters”) that edges toward therapy-speak in peak beats, slightly undermining raw immediacy. The change feels earned, but the scientific gloss risks distancing rather than deepening interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s ethically playful defiance and yearning for time’s texture are embodied in tactile, consistent choices—especially his refusal to sever the rope but instead integrate it. His internal contradiction (freedom vs. depth) plays out simultaneously in the climax, not as alternating summaries. The final micro-choice—knotting the rope around his wrist—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he trades pure drift for temporal entanglement. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lir’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is embodied through micro-choices (collecting sound fragments, initiating storytelling) and internal contradiction (fear of incompleteness vs. reverence for it). His acoustically perceptive trait informs action without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of unbinding his father’s half-told tale crystallizes his arc with visible emotional cost. No safety-hedging; his flaw (attachment to silence) is confronted through communal ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus faint emotional resonance—are embodied through tactile actions (static sensing, petal handling) and micro-choices (adjusting myrrh, subsuming Mira’s anguish). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception filtered through his trade. However, Mira remains underdeveloped beyond her function as client, limiting relational depth. The final renunciation of his “faint pang” is earned but slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Mira are vividly rendered with specific contradictions—his shrewdness paired with whimsy, her reclusiveness tempered by quiet generosity. Their motivations stem from lived trauma and evolve through micro-choices (e.g., Elias pocketing the locket, Mira admitting her role). However, emotional shifts occasionally lean on label-speak (“cautious exuberance” repeated as descriptor rather than embodied state), slightly flattening interiority at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to graft herself into community—is consistent and embodied through her reed-weaving and bold sympathy, but secondary characters lack individuated interiority; their roles serve thematic resonance over causal pressure. The final choice to weave the arbor canopy is earned, yet the “boldly sympathetic” trait functions more as label than constraint with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her profession and personal history, with the infinity pendant embodying generational legacy. Her internal conflict—urgency versus precision—is dramatized through micro-choices (borrowing time, interpreting cadences) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotion remains embodied (“pencil flew,” “pendant pulsed”) without diagnostic self-awareness. The only limitation: secondary characters are absent, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested—but this fits the single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s motivation—ambiguous loss of Elowyn—is compellingly rooted in grief and intellectual yearning, driving his inventive ritual with emotional and conceptual stakes. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied through tactile actions (tracing stone, fitting eyes) rather than abstract reflection. The “gently inventive” trait manifests credibly in how he reads fractures as equations, turning ruin into opportunity. However, the final realization leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle against self-deception or flawed assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in grief and a vow made with his dying wife, compelling his actions with quiet urgency. His internal contradiction—desiring visibility yet living in shadows—is embodied through tactile choices (polishing the fragment, leaving chalk trails). The woman’s presence crystallizes his arc without over-explaining; his final step into light feels earned, not sentimental. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion flows through action and object.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—obsessive curiosity driving self-annihilation for knowledge—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His internal conflict (“reluctance gnawed… yet curiosity’s tide pulled harder”) manifests as embodied contradiction, not summary. However, his transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; he drinks the tea once and the metamorphosis proceeds inexorably, reducing agency to passive surrender. The final whisper feels earned but stems more from poetic inevitability than a series of costly decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias and Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—Elias’s “wryly earnest” desperation and Mira’s ancestral hunger feel specific, not archetypal. Their micro-choices (exchanging brooch for painting) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: relinquishing isolation for shared meaning. The final renunciation—to keep the brooch would “mock the lesson”—is earned by prior causality and forecloses his old artistic solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile action (“fingers lingering,” “boots squelching”).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thorne’s motivation—yearning to magnify everyday magic—is clear and embodied through his pilgrimage and reaction to the cave. Elara’s internal contradiction (seer blind to her own fate) drives the climax credibly. However, her final choice to surrender to the forces lacks sufficient prior micro-choices showing her hierarchy of values; the pivot feels slightly rushed. Both characters remain distinct and flawed, but Elara’s agency at the turning point leans on revelation over accumulated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with relics and visions, and his “reactively visionary” trait drives micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction remains muted—his resolve never wavers or fractures under the weight of grief, flattening emotional complexity. The final act of heartening feels earned but lacks a visible cost to Elias himself, weakening the Earned Stasis potential. His flaw (passive compilation without personal risk) isn’t tested until the climax, where it resolves too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his identity as a mapper, and his internal conflict—between doubt and “trembling certainty”—is embodied in micro-choices (kneeling, punching air, boarding). His flaws (obsession, hesitation) directly shape tactics and cost. However, the final transformation into “archivist of the revealed” leans slightly toward unearned epiphany without sufficient friction between his analytical rigor and emotional revelation. The spectral world accepts him too readily, softening the cost of his obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism and kindness coexist in micro-choices like offering tea before investigating the tile. Her emotional arc feels earned, especially when transcribing memories becomes an act of vulnerability rather than proof-seeking. The flashback to her mother is concretely cued by the tile’s warmth, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her final stance crystallizes with visible cost: relinquishing pure skepticism to embrace entangled truth.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s motivation—boredom transmuting into hunger for novelty—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving his pivotal choice to ignite the mutiny. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory-rich perception (“refracted shadows,” “electric hunger”). However, his emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves cleanly from ennui to intrigue without resistance or hesitation that would deepen credibility. The final renunciation of stasis feels earned but slightly swift given eons of inertia.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s motivation—seeking “the mathematics of a fair trade”—is compellingly rooted in filial contradiction and embodied through precise, high-stakes choices. His internal shift from rigid honesty to strategic fluidity feels earned via the ink’s catalytic effect and Victor’s silent presence. The final breach crystallizes his transformation with visible cost: abandoning scruple for survival. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion manifests through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s motivation—to collect “textures of different times”—is vividly embodied through tactile, sensory-driven rituals, and his internal conflict (invention vs. truth) culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses escapism with visible cost: confronting the town’s frozen trauma. His micro-choices—gilding paper, charting hums—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in precision over comfort. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized restraint; the shift from avoidance to confrontation lacks granular struggle, softening the contradiction between studious control and raw grief.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—driven by tactile hunger for memory texture—is embodied through consistent micro-choices (e.g., crouching at low tide, layering fragments) and internal contradiction: nameless yet seeking identity, erased yet relentlessly perceptive. Their flaw—hyper-sensitivity to layered pasts—enables discovery but isolates them, culminating in a credible endurance that reclaims selfhood without sentimentality. The death certificate backstory is concretely anchored to present action (poison label resonance), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of erasure feels earned via accumulated sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his “gloomy cheerfulness,” the seashell talisman, and unfinished cello reveal a man wrestling with truth and transience. His motivation intensifies credibly through micro-choices: aligning shell to f-holes, bowing strings to reframe voices. The final laugh amid ruin feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost visible in the flaking paint and silent shell. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning) act simultaneously, especially when he “retells” Hale’s voice into melody.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict—torn between carnival chaos and mainland order—is embodied in her tactile grip on the foundation stone and micro-choices like embedding it in paint. Her motivation intensifies credibly from absorption to active resistance, with flaws (dual allegiance as tension, not safety-hedged virtue) driving tactical innovation. However, Kai’s function borders on plot device; his shock is absorbed but not reciprocally tested, slightly flattening relational pressure. The final renunciation of tidy resolution (“just another act”) earns stasis through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “purposefully curious” trait drives concrete choices—climbing the summit, deploying chemical signals—and his internal conflict between preservation and survival is embodied in tactile actions (kneeling, mixing vials). His emotional state degrades believably under oxygen stress, and his final endurance feels earned. However, his backstory as crater inspector lacks on-page friction that would deepen contradiction beyond archetype. The closing realization about the grain’s micro-etchings slightly borders on convenient epiphany but is anchored by prior physical handling.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile expertise and emotional investment in the drone’s “whispered story,” avoiding diagnostic interiority. His blindness isn’t a label but a lived constraint shaping method and perception. The final renunciation—remaining behind while the ship departs—carries quiet cost, crystallizing his role as eternal guide. However, secondary characters (apprentices, captain) lack individuation beyond functional roles, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harlan’s motivation—finding the rivers’ origin—is consistent, deeply personal, and intensifies credibly with each discovery. His dry wit and subtle confidence manifest in micro-choices (e.g., trusting the falcon, interpreting condensation) that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. Interiority is concrete (“pulse quickened beneath his parka,” “fingers traced the crease”) without diagnostic labels. The final departure embodies Charged Poise: he accepts isolation and risk, foreclosing retreat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (“restore shared balance”) is clear and consistent, and his actions align with his role as a bell tuner seeking harmony. However, his interiority remains abstract—phrased through labels like “infinitely patient” and “cryptic” without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The ghosts’ gratitude feels unearned because Elias never faces meaningful resistance or personal cost; his competence lacks struggle. Final renunciation is absent—he simply departs, with no path foreclosed or sacrifice shown.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is rooted in ancestral duty and personal yearning, with embodied emotion (oxygen gauge, heartbeat) grounding her high-stakes choices. Internal conflict between survival instinct and spiritual mission plays out in real time, not summary. The vial-triggered memories credibly shift her resolve without therapy-speak. Her final choice feels earned through micro-decisions under pressure, though the ancestral backstory leans slightly toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—redemption through silence—is compelling and rooted in generational trauma, driving his methodical vengeance and ritualistic threading of the labyrinth. His internal conflict between inherited shame and quiet justice manifests in embodied choices (bare feet on stone, clutching the lattice) rather than exposition. The father-son dynamic is rendered with emotional specificity, though the lack of on-page interaction limits relational crucible depth. Final renunciation of violence for narrative redemption feels earned, with cost embedded in hidden bodies and deferred discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his breath fogging air, clutching the bead, staggering under venom—but his motivation hinges on backstory rather than active choice. The ghost bride’s appearances drive him passively; his agency emerges only in consuming the fruit, a reactive gesture. His emotional contradiction (longing vs. self-preservation) simmers but never fully erupts into a micro-choice that alters tactics. Final transcendence feels bestowed, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is consistent and embodied through her weaving, sleepwalking, and defiance of broken precedents. Her interiority is poetic but grounded in tactile detail (frayed nets, orchid-dyed thread), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her “hauntingly optimistic” trait borders on untested idealism; the story lacks contradictory impulses in-scene that would deepen her struggle. Her final endurance feels earned, yet the absence of a tangible personal cost beyond communal loss slightly undercuts emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring lost faith through physical and spiritual excavation—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies with each discovery. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions arise through tactile engagement (tracing roots, fitting stones). The diaspora backstory anchors present choices without flattening pressure. Final renunciation of exile is earned via sustained labor, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in a discovered marginal note—feels earned and fuels her “carefully inventive” methodology. Her interiority is concrete (“sweat beaded on her brow despite the dawn chill”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The backstory flashback is brief, anchored in present action (the letter), and alters her current stance. However, her flaw lacks active contradiction in-scene; she executes flawlessly, missing a beat where error or hesitation could deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent: her wisdom disguised as folly enables her covert role as cosmic truth-seeker. Her micro-choices—feigning clumsiness, spilling tea to hide the chart—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost (social dismissal for strategic secrecy). Interiority is concrete (“gnarled fingers fumbling threads”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional progression lacks contradiction or degradation under stress; she remains preternaturally steady, missing a flaw that could deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in regret and pride, with embodied emotion (“heart a fierce tenderness,” “gash on her thigh”) and micro-choices (whispering incantations, tracing runes) that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—pride vs. longing appears sequentially rather than in active conflict during key decisions. Thorne’s late appearance limits relational crucible depth, though his whispered line credibly echoes her stance. The resolution feels earned but leans slightly on symbolic alignment over messy human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—grafting meaning onto old wounds—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (feigning curiosity, tracing notes, untying the string) and rooted in specific backstory that directly informs her present actions. Her “shrewdly innocent” trait manifests in behavior, not label, and her emotional contradiction (grief vs. hope) pulses through tactile details like trembling fingers and tears. The final whisper to Kael crystallizes a renunciation of solitary suffering, earned by prior causality. However, Kael remains slightly underdeveloped as a crucible; his role leans symbolic over interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rediscovering lost joy—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (kneeling, cradling the fragment, painting with light). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; “pensive mirth” is shown via chuckles, tears, and wry smiles. However, her emotional shift from longing to fulfillment lacks a micro-choice under pressure that visibly forecloses an alternative path—the resolution leans on revelation rather than renunciation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Lena are vividly rendered with interior contradictions—Elias’s “methodically playful” restoration ethos clashes with Lena’s rigid skepticism, both embodied through tactile choices (brushwork, coin handling, posture). Lena’s transformation feels earned: her childhood memory emerges organically from sensory overload, not exposition. However, Elias’s backstory with the hobo nickel remains underexplored, slightly weakening motivation depth. The final micro-choice—Lena stepping toward the mural—is charged with visible cost: surrender of professional certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—guarding his “spark of defiance”—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure, driving bold choices like infiltrating Voss’s greenhouse. His rogue scholar persona manifests in micro-choices (e.g., feigning eco-devotion) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority remains concrete (“mind alive with untaxed rebellions”) without diagnostic label-speak. However, his emotional progression lacks contradiction; he moves from hunger to triumph without meaningful internal friction or degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—“shyly unstoppable,” rage transmuted to art—but his transformation hinges on a cosmic artifact rather than internal causality. The epiphany “blossom armistice” feels conceptually imposed, not earned through prior struggle. His micro-choices (etching verses, clutching the postcard) reveal consistent values, yet the final surrender lacks tangible cost beyond poetic abstraction. A near-flawless lyric character study undercut by unmotivated resolution mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in the loss of Lirien—is consistent and embodied through tactile ritual, not abstract regret. Her “gently systematic” precision reveals a hierarchy of values: preservation over personal peace. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; sorrow is shown via foxglove tears, trembling hands, and the cost of shattered bamboo. The final renunciation (accepting Lirien’s name is preserved but gone) earns an Earned Stasis with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully reckless” impulse manifests in micro-choices like lifting the stopper despite Thorne’s doubt. Their relationship functions as a crucible: each vow tightens emotional stakes, and Thorne’s shift from skepticism to belief feels earned through the symphonies’ revelations. However, Elara’s fear of divergence borders on diagnostic (“dread of divergence”) rather than dramatized earlier, slightly flattening motivation pre-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in clashing values—flood control vs. sacred preservation—and his internal conflict manifests through embodied choices (e.g., trembling hands, tactile chain use). His micro-decisions (analyzing adhesive, sketching on parchment) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: risking clan trust and ancestral legacy. The backstory is tightly anchored to present stimuli (the envelope) and alters tactics immediately. Only slight over-articulation in “encrypted compassion” risks diagnostic label-speak but is offset by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving his wife’s lullabies through a fabricated Martian myth—is rooted in trauma, grief, and a desperate need for meaning, making his reinvention psychologically credible. His internal conflict between deception and longing for connection manifests physically (trembling hands, frantic mapping) and relationally (with Lila). The pivotal choice to send the truth via pigeon feels earned because it emerges from weeks of shared trust-building and his prior pattern of using pigeons as unburnable vows. His flaws (self-deception, isolation) directly shape both his error and redemption, with visible cost: the near-loss of Lila and the shattering of his fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s motivation—driven by a “core ache” to understand sacred thresholds—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is embodied (“featherly determined,” tracing grain with “fingers featherlight”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final choice to cross the threshold while honoring distance feels earned, with visible cost (“Close the distance, lose the light”). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; desire for reunion never visibly wars with fear of profanation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—“to learn the rhythm of belonging”—is embodied through tactile choices (pocketing the feather, tracing geometries) and deepens credibly when shared breath syncs with fireflies. Theo’s reclusive engineer role applies immediate pressure, and their tentative bridge feels earned. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; Elara’s “solitary star-gazing” lacks friction against her yearning until the very end. The final handhold crystallizes change without over-explaining, but a sharper earlier doubt would elevate this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “cheerful gloom,” sea-foam skin, and micro-choices (kneeling, tracing seeds) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation—to recover vanished paths—is rooted in personal loss and intensifies credibly. The final renunciation (“paths vanish to make room for wilder flights”) is earned through tactile interaction with the crater glass and seeds. However, her emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, softening the cost of her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jasper’s analytical nature and desire to disrupt monotony are consistently embodied through micro-choices—scattering chess pieces with “physicist’s precision,” reading Elara’s posture like a board state. His motivation drives tangible action, not just observation. Elara’s transformation feels earned via sensory triggers (the bishop’s carving, her grandfather’s voice) rather than epiphany. However, the lanky man’s shift leans slightly convenient, lacking the same granular buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—panic “fracturing like flawed glass,” tides “raging within”—and her contradiction between artistic purity and longing for Kai drives credible micro-choices. Her final renunciation of exile feels earned, with clear cost: anchoring herself voluntarily after escaping cosmic compulsion. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in physical sensation and dance. However, Kai’s interior remains thin, though his limited presence justifies this under Track A.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (tracing fractures, tossing the pebble). His internal conflict surfaces in micro-choices: kneeling to read ripples, pocketing the shard. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“reading between the lines of his own doubts”) rather than raw contradiction under pressure. The final resolve feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond implied communal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied through scar tissue, porcelain fissures, and restrained gestures, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His contradiction—hardened resolve vs. tender restraint—is active in scene, especially when brushing dirt from Lena’s cheek. However, Lena’s emotional shift (“I’ll fight smart, like you”) feels slightly tidy given her fresh trauma, bordering on unearned epiphany. Motivation is clear but the child’s rapid resilience lacks micro-hesitations that would ground it in crisis realism.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete sensory perception and embodied logic—her “equations for hope” feel character-specific, not abstract. Her motivation intensifies credibly across trials, culminating in a choice that forecloses sterile logic at visible cost (the shadow timeline). However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than enacted in simultaneous impulses; her struggle leans toward competence without palpable missteps. The final smile lacks the friction of doubt that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “sensitively perceptive” trait manifests in tactile, sensory choices (e.g., cupping the film to his ear) rather than abstract introspection. His motivation evolves credibly from dismissal to duty, with a clear hierarchy of values revealed in micro-choices (sifting ashes, tracing maps). The legacy burden compels a morally fraught reckoning that forecloses denial, and his final act of sketching “atonement” carries tangible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; contradictions feel human, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s motivation—reshaping mirrors through borrowed heartbeats—is vividly rooted in backstory and consistently drives her actions. Her internal conflict (desire to alter reality vs. fragility of existence) is embodied through ritualistic grace and perceptual calm, not abstract summary. However, her choices lack tangible contradiction or struggle; the process unfolds with near-effortless success, muting emotional stakes. The final renunciation of form feels earned but carries minimal visible cost beyond dissolution, which is routine rather than sacrificial.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully rooted in past failure, and her internal conflict—between idealism and guilt—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., trembling hand at the brazier, pressing her palm to seal the accord). However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“her own naive compromise had ignited the Forever War”) rather than fully contradictory, messy feeling under stress. Secondary characters lack individual pressure; they function as a chorus, not crucibles. The final sacrifice feels earned but borders on operatic self-abnegation without sufficient present-moment struggle against it.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—amorality vs. secret sentiment—is embodied in tactile detail (tracing the egg, tears salting his cheeks) and drives his climactic choice. His motivation is consistent and intensifies believably, rooted in childhood grief. However, the transition from corporate predator to penitent feels slightly compressed; a micro-choice showing active resistance to his own nature would deepen credibility. The final renunciation earns cost through silence and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to defy the lullaby—is clear and consistent, and her chastity functions as both trait and tactic. However, her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she never wavers or struggles under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned thematically but lacks a micro-choice with tangible cost that alters her options mid-scene. Her purity reads more as symbolic label than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—between ethical intent and the thrill of control—is embodied through precise gestures (tracing the stick, reversing it) and culminates in a credible renunciation. His motivation intensifies believably from defense to self-reckoning. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“puppets had been crutches”) without sufficient irrational resistance mid-crisis. The final choice is earned, with visible cost: abandoning his barroom identity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her grandmother’s lore and scientific validation, and her micro-choices—knotting specific hitches, embedding wings—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; she experiences reverence and sorrow but no palpable tension between competing impulses. Her emotional arc lacks irrationality or self-deception, trending toward elegiac certainty rather than crisis. The final renunciation (not rebuilding) is credible but feels preordained, not wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—forgiveness transmuted into preservation—is vividly rooted in guilt and artisan identity. Her interiority is concrete (“callused fingers,” “breath a fragile steam”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The contradiction between fragility and resolve animates her actions, especially threading the card into the rope. However, her emotional shift from exile to purpose leans slightly on lyrical assertion rather than micro-choices under pressure, just missing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—uncovering why paths choose walkers—is compellingly rooted in her cursed perception and personal history, driving decisive action. Her internal contradiction (blind to present yet compelled by past/future) is embodied through trembling fingers, neural mist, and transcendent laughter. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle; the directive explains itself too readily, softening the cost of her transformation. The final choice feels earned but lacks a tangible sacrifice beyond abstract “fog.”

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ezar’s frugality is not just a trait but a lens that shapes perception, action, and epiphany—his reuse of stylus, ink, and decrees reveals character through micro-choices. Motivation to “seal a covenant with the Unknown” intensifies credibly as empirical irony challenges his worldview. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied in tactile acts like tracing schematics or extinguishing a lamp. Final renunciation (resetting the tile) forecloses personal gain for cosmic stewardship, with cost felt in oil saved, not spent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s resentment and Elias’s pacifist scheming are embodied through micro-choices and sensory memory rather than exposition. The cellular-memory device avoids therapy-speak by tying emotion to physical vibration and fractured perception. However, Elias’s motivation borders on omniscient control—his “scheme” lacks visible struggle or risk, flattening his flaw into saintly certainty. Thorne’s transformation feels earned, but Elias reads more as archetype than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—recapturing his wife’s apparition—is rooted in consistent traits (craftsman, grieving widower) and intensifies credibly through embodied action. His internal conflict between grounded realism and desperate hope manifests simultaneously in tactile choices (mirror placement, breath synchronization). The final embrace earns its emotional weight through micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values: intimacy over illusion, presence over memory. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is rendered through frost-fogged glass and synchronized breath, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias and Lila’s motivations are deeply rooted in consistent, contradictory traits—his quiet persistence masking fear of irrelevance, her feistiness both driving her away and fueling return. Their micro-choices (Lila snatching the ribbon, Elias offering the bag) reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. Interiority is embodied (“silken threads still faintly scented with her girlhood wildflowers”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final reconfiguration feels earned through prior causality, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is clear and intensifies credibly, driving her to engrave the cameo. Her internal conflict (bewilderment vs. determination) manifests in embodied choices: lingering between pages, retreating to the bathroom, tracing intent into the shell. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphanic ease; the transition from “bewildered” to “weaver of loops” lacks friction or visible cost beyond abstract disquiet. The cameo’s inheritance from her future self is conceptually neat but risks feeling unearned without deeper struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, with micro-choices revealing her hierarchy of values—e.g., inscribing counter-charms instead of fleeing. Her “carefully resourceful” trait manifests in concrete tradeoffs: rationing ink, cross-referencing sketches under pressure. The time traveler remains a functional foil rather than a fully realized secondary character, but their limited presence doesn’t harm coherence. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarization mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—reuniting with her chimera twin through narrative restoration—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom”), though some emotional states verge on lyrical abstraction without sufficient grounding in micro-choices under immediate pressure. The final renunciation of conventional freedom for eternal rediscovery feels earned, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Twin interaction is limited to memory and vision until the climax, reducing relational crucible impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s warmly methodical nature and adaptability are consistently embodied in micro-choices—her calm ledger notation, tactile handling of relics, and deliberate rope reconfiguration—but her internal contradiction remains understated rather than dramatized. The final renunciation of mystery for clarity feels earned, though the emotional cost is conceptual more than visceral. Her competence borders on effortless, slightly muting struggle. Still, her scholar’s integrity drives every action with clear motive.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Mapkeeper’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her callused fingers, steady breath, and reverence for ripple-marks reveal a lifetime of practice. Her internal conflict is subtle but present: the tension between urgency and repose under invasion. However, her emotional range remains narrowly channeled through poetic abstraction rather than visceral contradiction, limiting full interior complexity. The final endurance feels earned, yet lacks a micro-choice that visibly sacrifices an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to prove coincidences hold meaning—is compelling and consistent, driving every action toward the beacon’s rekindling. Her retrocognition is embodied through visceral, contradictory visions (e.g., doubting their truth while acting on them), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The shard of hush deepens her gift without resolving internal conflict cleanly; doubt lingers even in triumph. Final endurance—descending with quiet certainty—earns Charged Poise with cost: she bears the weight of proof alone.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Archivist’s preemptive nostalgia is vividly embodied, not merely labeled, and her micro-choices—tracing shadows, interpreting lengths—reveal a hierarchy of values tied to identity and memory. Her internal contradiction (craving truth over solace while fearing erasure) drives every action. However, her transformation leans slightly on lyrical assertion rather than dramatized struggle; the cost of her endurance is felt but not viscerally contested in a pivotal moment. Still, her voice and emotional texture remain consistent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his chants, knot-spinning, and chemical mixing reveal a psyche wrestling with hopelessness through “serious playfulness.” His motivation (defying starless gloom) intensifies credibly into higher-stakes action. The final vow feels earned by his prior struggle, with cost legible in the smoldering knot and spent powders. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile ritual and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s internal conflict—torn between past loyalty and future possibility—is embodied in trembling hands and cracked voice, not diagnostic labels. Elaron’s motivation to “discover the texture of time” is consistent and drives his pivotal action with the cicada. Both characters feel specific, not archetypal, though Mira’s transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without enough prior micro-resistance. The final choice (accepting the cicada) is earned through sensory buildup rather than sudden insight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and rebellion against her father are embodied with visceral specificity (“chest tight, breaths shallow”) and drive micro-choices under pressure (draping her scarf to isolate the sprout). Her internal contradiction—fear of enclosure vs. desire for expansive silence—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final decision to carry “skies in her doll” feels earned by prior causality, though the father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth. Motivation intensifies credibly through the inversion sequence without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to teach silence how to comfort—is embodied through precise actions (swirling the vial, applying catalyst oil) and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. Mira and the children feel real in their exhaustion and curiosity, though their interiority remains secondary to Elias’s POV, which is appropriate for scope. The phrase “fluidly logical” risks diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by consistent physical demonstration. No unmotivated shifts; emotional progression from clamor to hushed joy feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “wisely adventurous” nature manifests in concrete micro-choices—deciphering murals under drone threat, cloaking via nostalgic echoes—that reveal a hierarchy of values (lore over power, stewardship over dominion). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“flake warming like a heartbeat”) and contradictory (yearning for restoration amid peril). The final renunciation of conquest for stewardship is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of deferred personal ambition. However, her flaw lacks sufficient compounding struggle—hubris is mentioned but not actively wrestled with during ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tender shadow keeper’s motivation—to teach suffocating to breathe—is embodied through precise micro-choices (burning bridges, heating the ring) and layered with credible internal contradiction: tenderness versus necessary cruelty. His emotional state remains visceral (“scars igniting with phantom heat”) without diagnostic label-speak. However, the off-page nature of “she” limits relational crucible depth, slightly softening the cost’s immediacy despite strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “virtuously mischievous” trait drives tangible choices—pranking fate by distributing diamonds—and his pyramid-scheme trauma informs his refusal to hoard, aligning action with motive. Interiority is vivid (“weight of lured friends... converging in virtuous rebellion”) and avoids diagnostic labels. His transformation from survivor to eternal volunteer feels earned through micro-choices (twisting the bolt, pocketing then sharing gems). The only flaw: slight abstraction in emotional embodiment during peak pressure (“felt it in his bones” borders on cliché).

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in generational legacy and moral reckoning. His interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception (“trembling hands,” “scepter of reckoning”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, his epiphany via “standing waves” borders on unearned mysticism without sufficient prior grounding in his expertise or sensory history. The final renunciation feels credible but leans slightly on atmospheric inevitability over granular psychological causality.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s withdrawn nature and yearning for possibility are embodied through precise micro-choices (kneeling, tracing patterns, unsnapping the clasp) that align with his motivation. His internal contradiction—silence versus desire for legendary voice—is rendered without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of pure solitude in favor of bound allegiance feels earned, though the emotional cost lacks a sharper physical or social manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s motivation—magnifying small kindnesses amid grief—is embodied in precise actions (transcribing, polishing the button) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through tactile reverence for artifacts versus bureaucratic detachment. The final decision to seek Lila’s traces emerges credibly from prior causality, with emotional cost legible in her renewed purpose. However, Amos and Lila remain off-page constructs, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—resisting apathy through careful resourcefulness—is embodied in tactile choices (clutching the key, memorizing the puddle-map) and consistent interiority. His underestimation by others fuels credible endurance rather than epiphany. However, emotional complexity leans slightly toward thematic assertion (“indifference was the true chain”) over contradictory impulses in crisis. Final renunciation of safety is earned, with cost implied in isolation and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—silencing a prophecy tied to his sister’s death—is clear and emotionally charged, rooted in consistent traits (solitary practice, nostalgic grief). His interiority is concrete (“breath syncing with the haze,” “dewdrops trembling on prisms”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, his final choice lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he executes a preordained ritual without internal friction or visible trade-off beyond emotional fatigue. The cost is felt but not dramatized as a foreclosed path—it reads more as endurance than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lir’s motivation—decoding prophetic leaves to heal the arbor—is consistent, embodied through tactile rituals (seed-sorting, monument-building), and intensifies credibly when the moonstone speck appears. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory-emotive phrasing like “mossy delight bubbling in his chest.” The final choice to descend into ash roots is earned by his method and desire, with clear cost: abandoning surface safety for uncertain depths. However, emotional contradiction remains muted; Lir experiences near-unbroken joy, lacking inner friction that would deepen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—craving control yet yearning to embrace chance—is embodied in precise actions (e.g., using a quartz shard as a screwdriver) and culminates in a credible, earned shift. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, uncertainty manifests through tactile improvisation. The transformation feels rooted in consistent traits, though the final renunciation of old certainties leans slightly abstract without a concrete sacrifice beyond mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, guilt, and resolve manifest through tactile actions (cupping the coin, tracing cracks) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation stems coherently from past hubris and present love, driving high-stakes alchemical risk. The brother’s return feels earned because her micro-choices (infusing opposites, chanting glacial runes) directly reconfigure the name’s weight. Only slight over-articulation in “luminous regret” edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by immediate physicalization in gold-flecked tears.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to integrate laughter into healing—is embodied through action, not exposition, and drives her harp-playing tactics. Her “modestly fearless” trait manifests in micro-choices (ignoring chill, climbing slick rocks) with tangible cost (sweat, bone-deep cold). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; guilt, resolve, and sorrow emerge through sensory detail and instrument interaction. Harlan’s spectral anguish feels individualized, not archetypal, though his backstory leans slightly toward trope without deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—discovering the “mathematics of mercy”—is compelling and rooted in trauma, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead, it leans toward a singular, almost transcendent resolve. Her proprioceptive enhancement is vividly embodied, yet her emotional responses occasionally verge on diagnostic (“proprioception solving for the constant of grace”). The final renunciation feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. A hairline slip in emotional complexity prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is vividly rooted in childhood trauma and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete (“intuitions flooded her: whispers of drowned sailors”), and the fragment’s evolution from anchor to key mirrors her emotional arc. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward fulfillment without meaningful hesitation or self-doubt that would deepen psychological realism under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theo’s motivation—uncovering hidden truths—is consistent, embodied through tactile observation and spectral engagement. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via physical detail (“chill that never left his bones,” “heart quickened”). The final act of releasing the ghosts stems credibly from his compulsion, with a felt cost: the “fractional” lifting of burden implies ongoing duty. His flaw (obsession with concealed truths) directly enables resolution without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is vividly embodied through his tactile engagement with ink, frost, and the bottled whisper. His internal contradiction (preservation vs. rupture) drives every action, culminating in a credible renunciation of stasis for shattering revelation. The final laugh and fusion with eternity feel earned, not epiphanic, because his decades-long yearning is dramatized through consistent micro-choices (e.g., aligning discarded type as a key). No diagnostic label-speak mars his crisis; emotion is rendered through physical tremors and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—reimagining the Aetherians to redeem his failed revolution—is vividly rooted in poetic sorrow and consistent with his defunct-revolutionary identity. His internal contradiction (grief vs. hope) manifests in embodied choices: etching verses, devising a plan, shattering the shard. The final act of destruction-as-provocation reveals a hierarchy of values: legacy over possession, myth over truth. However, Lira and Kane remain underdeveloped foils, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—reclaiming light to awaken his daughter—is powerfully rooted and emotionally specific, driving every action with visceral urgency. His interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with tools and the music box, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. However, his emotional arc lacks internal contradiction; he moves from grief to triumph without meaningful resistance or doubt, flattening complexity. The absence of flawed judgment or self-deception undercuts the “genuine struggle” expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her “sensibly eccentric” obsession with petrichor—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority is embodied through sensory perception rather than diagnostic labels, and her final choice (to embrace mystery over explanation) feels earned by prior causality. However, the expedition ghosts’ approval borders on unearned validation, slightly softening the cost of her transformation. The core contradiction—logic versus surrender—is dramatized well, but the ease of her communion lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “spirited driftwood sculptor” and “perpetually learning” artist, compelling her to transform isolation into creative alliance. Her interiority is concrete—fingers tracing stone, humming into gales—and micro-choices (carving specific sigils, igniting driftwood fire) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the epiphanic ease with which she masters timewoven alliances lacks struggle; her competence borders on unearned, flattening emotional contradiction. The cost of her transformation feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through her artistic obsession and tactile engagement with postcards, glass, and paint. Her internal conflict—between intellectual pursuit and emotional surrender—is rendered in sensory detail rather than abstraction. The epiphany feels earned because it emerges from sustained physical labor (cleaning the window) and pattern recognition across artifacts. However, the final realization leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“vulnerability’s grace”), flirting with label-speak despite strong contextual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in archival duty and moral urgency, intensified by the letters’ revelations. His interiority is concrete—trembling fingers, vertigo, dual-timeline awareness—and his micro-choices (arranging debris, forming the oath sigil) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied through tactile detail (raw fingers on volcanic glass). However, his transformation lacks a visible cost beyond psychological strain—no tool lost, no physical sacrifice—limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—reimagining civilization from ashes—is compelling and consistent, anchored in his rejection of “false comfort.” His interiority is vividly embodied through sweat, burning eyes, and tactile engagement with memory. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves linearly from resolve to triumph without inner friction that would deepen authenticity. The absence of doubt or temptation undercuts the “flawed but striving” complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in a formative childhood memory that directly fuels his present ritual, creating a causal loop between past and present. His internal conflict—collecting emotions but never sharing them—is embodied in tactile detail (“fingers trembled,” “velvet disquiet”) and crystallizes in his final vow to immerse himself. The renunciation of pure archiving for lived experience feels earned, with clear cost: the loneliness he has long avoided confronting. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to feel the texture of borrowed time—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action with emotional and thematic precision. Her internal contradiction (desire for knowledge vs. fear of entropy’s cost) manifests in micro-choices like trembling fingers and the deliberate use of the acorn cap. The final plunge into the vortex is earned through prior causality and carries conceptual cost: lineage preservation versus cosmic balance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to favor listening over noise—is credibly rooted in his daily practice and deepened by his tactile relationship with instruments and the bell rope. His choice to flip the switch is earned through consistent interiority, micro-choices (e.g., mending with resin glue), and embodied contradiction: torn between siren’s urgency and bell’s resonance. However, emotional complexity remains slightly tidy; his “humble resolve” lacks a visible internal struggle at the climax. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s vulnerability and spiritual curiosity are embodied through tactile actions—sweeping stardust, trembling hands, pressing his forehead to the lantern glass—avoiding diagnostic labels. His internal contradiction (yearning for cosmic connection vs. janitorial invisibility) culminates in an earned renunciation: embracing vulnerability as strength. The final micro-choice—resuming his broom with “quiet power”—carries visible cost (abandonment by kin) and reconfigures his identity. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; grief resolves with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recluse’s motivation—preserving silence as sacred duty—is rooted in his tranquilly perceptive nature and intensifies credibly when confronted with the ghosts. His internal conflict is shown through embodied stillness and gaze, not exposition, and his final renunciation of speech carries visible cost: deeper isolation. However, his astonishment lacks contradictory impulses; he accepts the covenant instantly without struggle, weakening the emotional complexity expected at this tier. The choice feels earned but slightly too seamless for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to grasp time’s texture through grief—is embodied in tactile, specific actions (notching beams, handling the urn fragment) and deepened by his borrowed heart and illicit past. His internal contradiction—yearning for temporal coherence amid irreversible loss—drives every choice without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation of passive survival for active weaving feels earned, with cost etched into his bones. However, Lira exists only as memory/object, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover beauty in the incomplete—is embodied consistently through micro-choices: retrieving the feather, launching then mending the kite, using flawed materials to repair rather than replace. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through tactile attention (“warmly attentive” amid chaos) and quiet endurance. The final act of re-launching a scarred kite enacts Earned Stasis—foreclosing perfectionism at visible cost. However, his emotional arc lacks a moment of genuine struggle or doubt; his resolve feels unwavering, slightly flattening the human complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—his “gently systematic” nature drives precise, reverent action under mortal pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through tactile choices (e.g., “no force, just gentle pressure”). The final renunciation (“Partners now, not prisoners”) earns closure with visible bodily cost. However, internal contradiction remains muted—his calm borders on static, lacking simultaneous opposing impulses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied skepticism and contradictory impulses—her luminous doubt clashes with scientific rigor. Her micro-choices (hacking data, forsaking tenure) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Kai and Mira function as pressure-applying mirrors rather than full characters, which fits the scope. However, their motivations lean slightly on label (“heretic,” “neural chemist”) without deeper behavioral distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thorne’s motivation—reclaiming a battlefield through life—is consistent, embodied, and rooted in personal history. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile actions (crushing pods, gripping reins). The final act of scattering seeds is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of irreversible commitment. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his bloodhound instincts, tactile memory of decay, and grief for Mira feel specific and consistent. His shift from retired corpse-finder to life-hunter is credibly earned through the riddle’s call and Mira’s reappearance. However, Mira’s transformation into a “body-hunter” of survivors lacks sufficient on-page friction; her moral recalibration feels asserted rather than dramatized under pressure. The final hand-holding reconfigures their bond but leans slightly on emotional shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—turning confusion into exploration via ancestral custom—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“pencils trembling in the microgravity hum,” “compass rose warmed against her chest”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to leap into the rift is earned by prior causality: her gift, isolation, and sketching ritual converge meaningfully. However, internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; she moves swiftly from confusion to certainty without palpable struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elarion’s "sacredly playful" ethos manifests in concrete choices—bowing to the board, laughing amid horror—that reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. His motivation stems from embodied apprenticeship, not abstraction, and his final swap carries visible cost: spent secrets, lighter pouch, irreversible exposure. Internal contradiction flickers in his "cautious abandon," though the story avoids deep psychological friction by keeping stakes external. The Arbiter’s minimal presence limits relational crucible, but Elarion’s solo arc remains credible and vividly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s motivation—to chronicle “small gestures”—is vividly embodied through his actions and micro-choices (e.g., pacing words, rejecting the penumbra). His internal conflict between obsession with minutiae and archival purpose manifests as simultaneous impulses, not summary. However, the final renunciation of the shadow feels slightly abstract; while earned by pattern, the emotional cost lacks a concrete physical or relational anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and longing, and her internal conflict—fear of pain versus need for truth—is embodied through tactile choices (feather, stone). Her micro-choices (retrieving the feather, tracing glyphs) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: enduring memory’s thorns to reclaim home. The final renunciation of nostalgia for “truth” is earned by prior causality, though the shift from pain to clarity risks slight emotional tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt manifests through tactile fidgeting, strategic misreadings of the tapestry as a chessboard, and morally fraught flashbacks that inform present choices. His contradictory impulses (desperation vs. integrity, self-loathing vs. yearning for redemption) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final act of self-forgiveness emerges organically from his decoding process, not as an unearned epiphany. His flaw—rigging a tournament out of love—is specific, costly, and never safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her father’s exile and chafing against ritual dogma, driving concrete micro-choices (e.g., smudging charcoal as warpaint). Her “innocently mischievous” exterior credibly masks inner storm, though interiority occasionally leans into diagnostic phrasing (“defiant fire tempered by hush”). Emotional embodiment is strong but slightly abstracted in peak moments (“heart alight with prismatic victory”). The final renunciation—rejecting monolithic forgiveness—is earned through prior causality and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s interiority is richly embodied—his doubt, grief, and incremental resolve manifest through tactile interactions with the charm and statue. His contradictions (e.g., crafting poisons while seeking healing) feel authentic, not diagnostic. Each micro-choice (matching pockmarks despite failing breath) reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over survival. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than fully earned causality—the final certainty arrives just shy of flawless motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, deferred brushstrokes, and tear-mingled spring water reveal contradiction between nostalgic longing and fear of disillusionment. His final act of completion embodies a credible renunciation of illusion-as-permanence, with tangible cost in lost youth and solitude. The “intimately aloof” trait manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—rooted in boyhood heartbreak—drives every micro-choice, culminating in an earned stasis that forecloses further deferral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in regret and love, with embodied emotion (“sweat-slicked arguments,” “trembling hand”) and a credible internal conflict between passion and tenderness. His micro-choice to whisper rather than shout aligns with his arc and carries visible cost—the prior destruction of glass, Mira’s flight. However, Mira’s return feels slightly under-pressured; her shift lacks on-page friction or doubt that would deepen the emotional stakes of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s patchwork body and grief are embodied with visceral specificity—scars as “waypoints in loss’s atlas,” hands a “mosaic of old burns.” His contradictory impulses (to rebuild vs. endure isolation) coexist without resolution, and his micro-choices—lashing driftwood, winding coils—are rooted in ancestral memory and lunar cues. The final act of lighting the censer foot is earned by prior causality: each midnight call tightens his resolve, and the cost (solitary labor, physical pain) is felt throughout. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—psychological safety through controlled deception—is consistent, urgent, and embodied in precise micro-choices (disinfecting the eye, anointing with truffle oil). His internal conflict between rationality and longing for connection plays out simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The cost of occlusion is felt in his final doubt: “had occlusion truly healed, or merely draped the fractures in silken deceit?” Secondary characters apply immediate pressure, and their tentative trust validates his sacrifice without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, eccentricity, and quiet compulsion feel lived-in rather than labeled. His micro-choices (pocketing the boutonnière, affixing it to his lapel) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by past loss. The borrowed memories trigger authentic emotional layering without tidy resolution. However, the stranger remains a cipher, limiting relational crucible depth despite functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a deeply personal, inherited obsession that intensifies under pressure, and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels—emotions are embodied through sweat, trembling script, and tactile choices. His micro-decisions (e.g., kneeling carefully among blooms, trusting ants) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by decades of solitude. The final reckoning feels earned: not an escape but a reconfiguration of his life’s meaning, with loneliness acknowledged as a chosen cost now yielding to purpose. No head-hopping or secondary characters dilute focus, keeping characterization tightly calibrated to single-POV stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied disenchantment and contradictory impulses—her disdain for courtly artifice clashes with her hunger for meaning, driving her ascent. Thorne functions effectively as a pressure-bearing secondary character whose loyalty sharpens her resolve. The final choice to inhale the starlight feels earned by prior emotional buildup, though the speed of transformation slightly compresses the cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments, preserving authenticity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirien’s motivation—to capture the "density of presence"—is vividly embodied through her alchemical craft and culminates in a credible relational revaluation with Thorne. Her interiority blends scientific precision and romantic yearning without diagnostic label-speak, though the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. Thorne functions effectively as crucible, yet his reaction lacks micro-resistance that would deepen cost. The final choice feels earned but borders on tidy resolution given the high thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia, and jaded wonder manifest through concrete sensations (birch bark, frost, splintering timber). Her micro-choice to weaponize envy as a lucidity trigger feels earned and character-specific. The final renunciation (“jealousy’s method sated—for now”) carries visible cost: cyclical exhaustion, not resolution. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; contradictions pulse organically.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her lost sense of smell reshapes perception through touch and sound, grounding her intuition in credible sensory substitution. Her micro-choices (extracting the screw, crafting a compartment) reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving hidden grace over mere function. The backstory of the fire informs but doesn’t dominate; her motivation emerges organically from present action. However, the elderly woman remains underdeveloped, functioning more as catalyst than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform scars into stories—is embodied through crystallization, quill use, and micro-choices that foreclose exile. Her internal conflict (shame vs. legacy) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The crow-feather superstition grounds her arc in childhood specificity, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of shame is earned by prior causality with visible cost: luminous shedding, physical pain, and breath-held endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—ambition versus remorse, professional detachment versus emotional need—are embodied in tactile choices (singeing cuffs, gripping the bottle) and voiced through metaphor rather than therapy-speak. Theo’s fragmented presence reflects his internal state without over-explaining. Their shared poetic idiom feels earned, not ornamental, and the final jolt of ozone and fruit conveys reconnection as echo, not resolution. The apology carries visible cost: his melody altered, trees falling, her column forever changed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s motivation is vividly rendered but lacks interior contradiction or embodied struggle; his epiphany feels unearned because no micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses. The character functions more as a vessel for theme than a conflicted individual. His actions align with motive, yet the absence of genuine error or limitation flattens emotional stakes. The final renunciation carries conceptual weight but no felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—understanding time’s “razor edges”—is vividly embodied through tactile actions (trembling hands, squinting, counting backward) and grows from professional duty to metaphysical obsession. His internal conflict between empirical rigor and emerging doubt feels authentic, not diagnostic. The final renunciation—accepting that time measures belief’s fragility—is earned by his methodical unraveling of the clock’s secrets. Minor deduction: the “mad horologist” backstory risks bordering on convenient lore rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is vividly embodied through her spatial perception and professional obsession, creating credible internal conflict between control and surrender. Her micro-choices (activating the beam, reconfiguring the algorithm) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: abandoning traditional security paradigms. Elias functions effectively as a crucible, not a foil—their shared language of light and permeability deepens Mira’s arc without over-explaining. However, the epiphany arrives with near-perfect emotional calibration, slightly undercutting the “genuine struggle” expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is precise and character-specific, embodying her “theoretically rebellious” nature through micro-choices (e.g., lighting the lantern, interpreting scrawls) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Her motivation—to honor her father’s genius without his demons—is consistent and intensifies through each subway clue. The final decision to publish his manuscript feels earned, with visible cost in relinquishing pure rejection of his legacy. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“clover-melancholy ache”) over physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—teaching renewal through severance—is compellingly embodied in his ritualized interactions and the glass harmonica, though Mira’s arc leans slightly toward thematic function over full interiority. His micro-choices (hanging up mid-sentence, spinning the disc faster) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The final renunciation feels earned, yet Mira’s transformation borders on epiphanic without sufficient on-page struggle. Contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. doctrine of estrangement) act simultaneously in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and archival devotion, with embodied emotion (“haunted euphoria,” “tears blurring the photo’s edges”) and micro-choices (petal selection by proximate cause) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The bone spoon carved from his rib crystallizes her flawed, obsessive love without sentimentality. However, interior contradiction remains underexplored—her desperation lacks counter-impulses beyond sorrowful resolve, slightly flattening emotional complexity at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “desperately jocular” mask and yearning for connection are embodied through specific gestures (cracking voice, wild grin) and micro-choices (seeding rumors, offering the rock with self-deprecating humor). His internal contradiction—orchestrating global aid yet craving personal reciprocity—is consistent and compelling. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched; their emotional shifts feel catalyzed more by the moon rock’s magic than by individualized pressure or choice, slightly flattening the crucible of relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elar’s motivation—navigating grief through the stillpoint—is rooted in consistent traits (blindness, tactile language absorption) and intensifies credibly. His interiority is concrete (“skin drank the earth’s mutterings”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (removing the ring) forecloses his old mapping method with felt cost: he now charts emotional terrain, not just vibrations. However, the rival mapmaker’s warning appears as summary, not dramatized pressure, slightly weakening micro-choice depth.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s “confidently uncertain” interiority is embodied through micro-choices (grasping the pen, unbending it) and contradictory impulses that never resolve into tidy epiphanies. Her motivation—to “thresh meaning from experience”—is dramatized through active revision of history, not declared. The cost of each edit is felt in reshaped memories and new contingencies, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her flaws drive the inciting error and its resolution without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Finn’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied melancholy and micro-choices (e.g., tracing waves, accepting the camera), and Elara’s motivation feels personal rather than abstract. However, her “joyful sorrow” remains more lyrical label than dramatized contradiction—her emotional complexity isn’t tested under pressure. Their relationship catalyzes change but lacks reciprocal friction; Elara functions more as muse than co-agent with stakes of her own. The final renunciation of invisibility is earned, yet the cost (continued anonymity by name) feels asserted more than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief sharpened into “searing focus,” “volcanic tenderness” as both flaw and fuel. Her contradictions (ferocity vs. tenderness, arsonist vs. guardian) act simultaneously, not sequentially. Micro-choices—brushing the figurine, tracing warm paint—reveal her hierarchy of values with tangible cost: exile, solitude, moral burden. Theo exists only in memory, so relationship-as-crucible isn’t applicable, but her loyalty to his promise drives every action credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in grief, love, and rebellion—is vividly embodied through drumming, pain responses, and micro-choices that foreclose compliance. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory contradiction (“auroral sorrow,” “rebellious spirit pressing against the harness”). Kai’s late emergence risks thinness, but his function as memory-bridge justifies his arc. The final renunciation of the harness earns stasis with visible cost: shedding her identity as a guinea pig.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—calculated caution versus spontaneous defiance—are embodied in his mimicry of Harlan’s walk and whispered taunts, revealing a hierarchy of values (subtlety over spectacle) with clear cost: surrendering maps or pride. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead filtering perception through profession (“identified people's walks like signatures”) and pressure. The final renunciation of shouting as a mode of power feels earned by prior tactics, not declared. Only slight over-articulation in “burned with a deeper motive” risks abstraction but is swiftly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s silent empathy and “spiralingly calm” demeanor are embodied through precise, consistent action—especially her weaving—and reveal a hierarchy of values (light over conquest, vulnerability over control). Umbra’s transformation feels earned because his loneliness is shown, not told, via “hollow eyes” and “tendrils recoiling.” However, interior contradiction is muted by the story’s lyric mode; Elara’s struggle remains externalized, limiting emotional granularity. The dental mirror’s past as a “healer’s relic” hints at backstory but doesn’t deepen present micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—planting “forests of second thoughts”—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his gift for hearing unspoken doubts. His interiority is concrete (“cradling the cool metal as if it were a fragile queen”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The story shows credible endurance rather than change: he renews his quiet rebellion without personal transformation, which fits Earned Stasis. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara and Kai’s contradictory impulses—grace versus grit, longing versus duty—are embodied in tactile detail (“seal in boots,” “chained to these planks”) and escalate credibly under pressure. Their shared merfolk nature feels earned by the scrimshaw’s truth-compelling power and prior barbed tenderness. Minor flaw: the transformation lacks internal struggle; their acceptance is instantaneous rather than wrestled with, slightly flattening the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The performer’s interior contradiction—between blank detachment and desperate need to narrate grief—is embodied through precise micro-choices (licking blood, selecting branches) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation stems from a morally complex act (mercy killing under emotional tyranny), and her performance-as-coping feels earned, not theatrical. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through action, not summary. Final endurance (continuing the ritual) constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost: no tears, only void.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cloud-shadow poet’s motivation is vividly rendered and aesthetically coherent, with interiority filtered through poetic perception rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—tracing quartz, paraphrasing verses—are consistent with his trait of being “aesthetically driven,” and the transformation at the end feels earned. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; desire for boundary dissolution operates without counterpressure beyond memory of the ban, which arrives too late to complicate present action. The absence of simultaneous opposing urges slightly softens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s “innocently cunning” contradiction operates in-scene—his feigned surrender masks strategic insight—and his final renunciation of sight is earned by years of tactile artistry. Mira’s immediate comprehension via plant code shows their relationship as a crucible that crystallizes under pressure. Both characters remain consistently flawed yet capable, with emotions embodied through gesture (twitching fingers, rustling blooms) rather than diagnosis. The cost—Elias forgoing color to preserve his worldview—is legible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elowen’s interiority is vividly embodied—her "powerfully gentle grace" and tactile engagement with sound refract a consistent, complex motivation. Her micro-choices (adjusting the lens, refracting grief) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The emotional arc avoids tidy resolution, embracing fragility as connection’s core texture. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—grief transmuted into celestial renewal—is rooted in specific, embodied history (the wilted rose on her husband’s ring) and intensifies credibly through tactile action (adapting jeweler’s tools). Her internal contradiction (numb despair vs. quiet ardor) manifests simultaneously in gestures like “trembling hands” crafting precise folds. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth, and the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle-compounded causality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” motivation is embodied in precise actions—inking cards, measuring paths—and her internal conflict (solitary archivist vs. shared legacy) crystallizes credibly when Theo arrives. Her micro-choices (adjusting a path by one degree, urging the letter) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: isolation foregone for duty. Theo’s hollow-eyed tremor and cracked voice convey embodied emotion without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of solitude is earned by prior causality and charged with intergenerational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—piercing history’s lies to understand paradise’s fall—is compelling and consistent, driving her increasingly desperate actions. Her internal conflict between order and chaos is embodied through micro-choices (random scroll reading, backward incantations) that feel authentic to a historian unraveling. However, the transformation into “chaotic insight” leans slightly toward diagnostic abstraction (“nostalgia’s atoms were addictive chains”) rather than fully dramatized reckoning. The final renunciation of personal memory carries emotional weight but borders on conceptual over embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving hope’s shape—is rooted in consistent traits (sharp-eyed vigilance, tactile memory via the river stone) and intensifies credibly toward self-sacrifice. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers trailing over orbs like a gardener”), emotions embodied (“heart ached with the glow of what was lost”), and her final metamorphosis earns cost through irreversible loss of human warmth. The river stone anchors her flaw: clinging to earthly hope in an ethereal realm. No diagnostic label-speak; contradiction between preservation and necessary binding feels organic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling convictions, guilt, and resolve manifest through tactile actions (cradling the tail tip, misting the chameleon) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (shedding layers of self-blame, vowing to choose wiser allies) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: trust lost, savings gone, yet compassion preserved. The chameleon functions as a crucible mirror, not a prop, forcing Elara’s reconfiguration. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy—each “layer” shed maps too cleanly to a thematic beat, softening the irrational messiness of real betrayal trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s motivation—to read scars as narratives—is embodied in visceral, contradictory action: she reopens wounds to seek closure, bleeding while tunneling. Her internal conflict is shown through micro-choices (prying the floor stone despite surgical pain) and sensory detail (“fingers bled into the earth”). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile struggle. Final renunciation isn’t erasure but acceptance—earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking where unused love lingers—is deeply rooted in personal loss and credibly drives her actions. Her spatial imagination isn’t just stated but embodied in how she navigates the booth and reconstructs hidden spaces. Internal conflict between hope and grief manifests through tactile choices (pressing film to pendant, prying the panel), not abstract reflection. However, her fiancé’s backstory feels slightly under-anchored compared to Eliza/Tom’s, slightly weakening emotional parity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between creative yearning and exhaustion is embodied through tactile actions (trembling fingers, kneeling on ice) and specific choices (resisting then surrendering to rest). However, her epiphany arrives with minimal friction—her “trapped creativity” shifts to “freed stardust” via auroral pronouncements rather than earned struggle. The final renunciation of insomnia feels more mystical than psychologically grounded, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guard’s transformation from dreamless vigilance to spark-tender feels earned through tactile interaction with the chess clock and dune. His motivation emerges organically from sensory immersion rather than exposition. However, interior contradiction is muted—his shift lacks friction or resistance, leaning toward epiphany over struggle. The final faint smile suggests emotional awakening but skirts deeper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—to reclaim his mind’s “wild frontier”—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (pressing the gear to his temple, unraveling the vine) and contradictions (cynical detachment vs. yearning for wonder). His transformation feels earned by sensory immersion and symbolic action rather than abstract epiphany. The small gear fusing to his being crystallizes internal change with tangible cost: loss of former identity as a “stray philosopher.” No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotions arise through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied—her “unused courage” metaphor and trembling ankles show internal conflict without therapy-speak. However, her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; she follows guides passively until the final stamp. The ferry guides’ influence borders on deus ex machina, weakening agency. Her arc feels earned emotionally but not causally.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied through nerve regeneration and moral reckoning; Thorne’s silent grief conveys depth without exposition. Both characters’ flaws—Elias’s complicity, Thorne’s cowardice—drive irreversible choices with tangible cost. The bolt discovery forces a micro-choice that reconfigures their relationship credibly. However, Thorne’s backstory arrives via archival log rather than dramatized revelation, slightly weakening motivation’s causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirion’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to his role as guardian, with micro-choices (e.g., selecting specific books, crafting ink) revealing his values. His diminutive form contrasts powerfully with titanic essence, but interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene. The absence of on-page interaction limits relational crucible testing. Final renunciation—enduring vigil rather than direct confrontation—is credible and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in witnessing coral apocalypse—is consistent and intensifies credibly into urgent inquiry. His tapping rhythm embodies interiority without therapy-speak, and micro-choices (e.g., prying lockers, wiring projectors) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the shift from grief to hope lacks friction. Final renunciation of aimlessness is earned but borders on tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to find meaning in chaos—is consistent and embodied through her barefoot movement, tactile interaction with relics, and final vision. However, her internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; “awkwardly confident” is labeled more than dramatized as a simultaneous tension. The epiphany at the stone circle feels slightly unearned due to minimal prior struggle or misbelief correction. Still, her micro-choices (picking up glasses, kneeling, placing palms) reveal a hierarchy of values with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—to evolve brittle traditions through insurgent intent—is embodied in her tactile care for the gardens and culminates in a high-stakes ritual choice. Her telepathic bond with plants isn’t just a trait but a lived constraint that shapes perception and action. The story avoids diagnostic interiority, grounding emotion in ash-streaked hair, callused hands, and the weight of the amber embryo. However, her internal contradiction (tradition vs. evolution) is asserted more than dramatized in real-time tension, slightly softening the climax’s psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her trauma manifests somatically, not through diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (tucking the photo, approaching the grieving artist) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in hard-won realism. The “quietly talented” trait enables her grafting work without boasting, aligning action with motive. However, the fiancé exists only as memory; his absence slightly limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “luminescent ache,” fragmented reflections, and rhetorical self-questioning reveal a coherent psychological collapse. His motivation to descend into darkness stems credibly from artistic shame, and his micro-choices (rifling shelves, untangling threads) align with his identity as a maker. However, the transformation at the loom feels slightly too seamless; the cost of rebirth (“glowing scar”) is stated but not dramatized through struggle, softening the emotional credibility of his renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s motivation—rooted in his “consciously wild” identity and temporal anomaly—is vividly embodied and drives every action. His internal contradiction (serene anger, feral grace vs. intellectual hunger) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Mira’s mirrored emotion deepens relational stakes without head-hopping or flattening. The final choice to merge with the ink is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of irreversible entanglement with chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior conflict is vividly embodied—her trembling hand, breath fogging air—and her motivation (“to provoke an unspoken conversation”) feels urgent and personal. However, her shift from “bravely conflicted” to decisive action lacks a micro-choice that dramatizes the tipping point; the transition leans on summary (“action had chosen for her”). The emotional arc is compelling but slightly over-articulated in phrases like “burned clearer,” bordering on diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s pacifism, rooted in her “senselessly perceptive” nature, drives every key choice with internal consistency. Her micro-decisions—sheathing the dagger, weaving the sandbag scrap, whispering to roses—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The father-daughter dynamic crystallizes meaningfully at closure without sentimentality. Only slight abstraction in emotional embodiment (“tranquil blaze”) prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in ancestral compulsion and embodied through precise, consistent actions—his calm amid chaos feels earned, not asserted. His internal contradiction (hunting a wild echo without taming it) manifests physically in the rail spike and voiced silence. The final choice—to secure the echo gently rather than triumphantly—demonstrates credible endurance with visible cost: he foregoes possession for preservation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tool, breath, and wave.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “devotedly observant” nature manifests in micro-choices (noticing Thorne’s rehearsed guilt, timestamp discrepancies) that directly drive the confrontation. Her motivation intertwines personal regret with investigative rigor, avoiding tidy resolution; she endures the cost of confronting her father’s legacy without collapsing into sentimentality. Thorne’s regret orbits hers in a credible, pressure-forged dynamic that shifts their relationship state by story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile memory (“cries he could never decipher”), not diagnostic labels, and his final choice—to tattoo the amber’s insect as a constellation—earns closure by binding his dissonance to ink. His contradiction (peddling cosmic maps yet bearing bare arms) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a micro-choice that forecloses his isolation with visible cost: the letters crumble, his arms are no longer empty. The infant’s digitized plea (“Daddy, the stars itch”) forces him to confront his past arrogance, making his renunciation of denial feel inevitable. No safety-hedging; his flaw directly caused the loss and shapes his redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover meaning in human mess—is compellingly rooted in her whimsical yet perceptive nature, and her actions consistently reflect this drive. Her interiority is vividly embodied through tactile engagement with sand and tile, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The tension between Marta and Theo is rendered with glances and micro-gestures that reveal layered history without exposition. However, the emotional shift at climax leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle, softening the cost of her intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her retrocognition isn’t just a label but a visceral loop that chips at her soul while fueling her resolve. Her micro-choice to rename Kael via the tessera crystallizes her hierarchy of values: empathy over vengeance, steel over fire. Kael’s transformation feels earned through the boyhood vision, not imposed. However, his shift leans slightly on revelation rather than struggle, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s synesthetic perception is vividly embodied and consistently shapes her emotional arc, with micro-choices—like stepping onto the stage—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict between despair and nostalgia feels simultaneous, not summarized. Reginald functions as a catalyst rather than a fully developed secondary character, but his pressure is immediate and relevant. The final renunciation of despair is earned, though the cost (scandal, lost career) remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s affectionate skepticism drives credible micro-choices—embracing Theo while doubting their telepathic bond—and her internal contradiction (longing vs. doubt) is embodied through somatic markers. Her final renunciation of chemical dependence in favor of natural connection feels earned. Theo remains a stable emotional anchor without overcomplication, fitting the two-character scope. Minor deduction: his interiority is thin, but this aligns with single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to voice the unknown—is embodied through tactile, sensory choices (e.g., pressing the fossil to her chest, floating toward the fissure) rather than abstract longing. Her internal contradiction—fear of the void versus desire to map it—manifests physically in the destabilizing thermal orbs and her eventual ascent. The fossil catalyzes a credible transformation from mapper to bridge, with cost implied in her final release of the relic. However, her emotional calibration remains near-perfect under extreme stress, slightly flattening human-like irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in generational duty and a desire to liberate fate. His internal conflict—between inherited prophecy and emergent possibility—is embodied through tactile interaction with amber and buttons. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the “quiet inspiration” remains more thematic than psychologically fraught. The final choice is earned, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—fixing what’s broken—is consistent and embodied through scarred flesh, the pillbox, and his renunciation of cyanide. His interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions manifest physically (“burned lips curled,” “heart prudent against traps”). The final choice to pass the torch is earned by prior causality: his network shattered in Prague, now rebuilt through Lena. However, Lena’s arc leans slightly archetypal—her “unused fire” lacks contradictory impulses beyond stated fear.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s motivation—to distill ancestral oaths into essence—is clear and intensifies through tactile, embodied action (mending the tapestry). His interiority is concrete (“felt the river's pulse sync with his own”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses; the struggle leans toward serene resolution without palpable resistance. The final renunciation of “tangled oaths” is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his zen calm, scarred hands, and phototropic pull toward kindness shape his actions without diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (kneeling, using the lantern, shaping clay) reveal a hierarchy of values aligned with his motive. However, the epiphany about “kindness imprinting deeper than catastrophe” leans slightly toward label-speak, though it’s mitigated by embodied context. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but his quiet departure with the pot shows earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” nature manifests in embodied contradiction—her lingering on the dead rosebush while clutching a tool of precision—and her micro-choices (offering the boat, gifting the gauge) reveal a hierarchy of values. Mira’s vulnerability feels specific, not archetypal, though her interiority leans slightly toward summary (“lost everything”) rather than fully dramatized gesture. The final transfer of the gauge tooth crystallizes Elara’s motivation without over-explaining. Flaw: Mira’s emotional shift borders on swift, though the rhythmic rowing justifies gradual thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation to transform isolation into independence is clear and intensifies credibly, culminating in a resonant choice to coexist with spectral echoes. Her interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensations (tingling wings, palm on sundial) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the transition from brittle awakenings to sovereign archivist lacks micro-choices showing struggle—her epiphany arrives smoothly, undercutting the “fragile” premise. The final declaration feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her role as secret-keeper clashes with her yearning for connection, culminating in a credible renunciation of anonymity. Her micro-choice to place the twig spiral is charged with history and risk. Theo’s return feels earned because her ghostwritten letters unknowingly sustained his hope. However, his sudden presence leans slightly on coincidence rather than fully dramatized causality, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her drive to outwit cosmic tricksters stems from professional expertise and personal stakes. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“heart a fragile ember,” “sweat from her brow”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The confrontation with Harlan reveals contradictory impulses: hope versus fear, trust versus control. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible cost beyond fatigue; the victory feels slightly unearned without deeper personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in micro-choices—mapping crevices, modulating organ notes—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction (rebellion vs. caution) acts simultaneously during the spatial mutiny climax. The final act of thrusting the compass feels earned by prior causality, with claustrophobic echo as lingering cost. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy in resolution, softening the raw edge of fear.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s face blindness is embodied through precise sensory perception and methodical ritual, not diagnostic labels. Her internal conflict—empathy as dormant seed versus professional detachment—drives the pivotal blood-ribbon act. The final choice (merging with Mira’s trace) is earned by prior causality: her ritual, lancet, and motive converge. Cost is visible: physical pain, emotional vulnerability, and irreversible engagement with the case.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in ancestral honor and reversible exile, driving her nervously confident actions with clear emotional stakes. Her interiority blends idealism and dread without therapy-speak, and her micro-choices—salvaging journals, confronting Hale—are consistent with her librarian identity and personal history. However, her emotional state occasionally verges on repetitive (“nervously confident” recurs like a refrain), slightly flattening contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of triumph to face “greater exiles” feels earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fiddler’s grief and guardedness feel embodied through tactile details (calloused fingers, clutching the flake) and his vow rooted in loss. His “dynamically observant” trait drives key actions—spotting the flake, decoding the scaffold map—revealing a hierarchy of values: curiosity over isolation. However, the hitchhiker vanishes too cleanly for the emotional pivot to feel fully earned; the stranger’s impact leans on cryptic convenience rather than reciprocal pressure. The final vow to follow the trail shows credible endurance with cost (abandoning “never”), but the internal contradiction lacks simultaneous friction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—fleeing his father’s legacy while drawn to origins—is clear and consistent, and his “polished calm” informs credible micro-choices (e.g., dissuading Raoul twice). However, interiority leans on repeated descriptors (“perceptively calm,” “polished calm”) rather than embodied contradiction, flattening emotional complexity under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a visceral cost beyond atmospheric melancholy. His flaw (legacy of theft) is acknowledged but never actively tempts him in-scene, reducing moral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne and Lyra’s motivations are consistent and emotionally grounded, with shared burdens shaping their choices. Interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic phrasing (“healed with words,” “frayed souls”) that borders on label-speak. Their micro-choices—pressing the daylily, tracing glyphs in dream-dust—reveal hierarchy of values. However, emotional progression leans tidy; exhaustion lifts too cleanly at revelation, undercutting sustained cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thorne’s guarded nature and internal conflict are embodied through concrete action—clenched fists, blood-pricking hesitation—and his contradictory impulses (seeking truth vs. resisting vulnerability) operate simultaneously in scene. His final unbending feels earned by prior causality: the flesh-eating seed demands sacrifice, and his choice to bleed aligns with his core trait of finding lost things, now turned inward. The confession’s raw delivery (“For power, I yielded him—yet power hollowed me”) avoids diagnostic label-speak and lands as fractured human truth. Minor deduction for slight emotional summarization in “man fractured” phrasing, though immediately grounded by physical staggering.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “anxious elation,” root-scars, and ritual-linked fate feel specific and contradictory. Her motivation (“purposefully curious”) drives tangible choices (pressing the clipping to her scar), and her endurance carries visible cost: permanent root-bondage despite restored covenant. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and her flaw (over-curiosity) isn’t shown causing prior mistakes—only enabling resolution. Final renunciation (accepting continued binding) is earned but lacks deeper internal struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—patching soul-holes from her brother’s death—is embodied through tactile ritual and consistent with her “reckless idealist” nature. Her internal contradiction (fiercely gentle yet willing to trammel destinies) drives every action, culminating in a credible, costly renunciation of freedom. The final choice feels earned, not diagnostic, with emotional complexity layered through blood-sealing and borrowed memories. No safety-hedging; her flaw directly enables both triumph and entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harl’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, roadie grit fused with appraiser precision—and his contradictory impulses (hiding vs. acting, facts vs. feeling) operate simultaneously during the scrap appraisal. His micro-choice to authenticate the relic and fund Jax’s memorial feels earned by prior causality. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“emotion fueled the next verse”) rather than fully dramatized transformation, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s kindly methodical nature is embodied in tactile actions—patting soil “as if soothing a child’s brow,” sharing “diluted truths”—and his internal conflict between haunted ambition and gentle precision feels lived-in, not diagnostic. His motivation to understand spirit-transition physics through analogy drives micro-choices (planting the seed, etching new cuneiform) that foreclose hubristic paths. The mentor’s absence functions as both emotional void and causal pressure, making Elias’s renunciation of conquest credible. No therapy-speak; emotions emerge through magnetic metaphors and physical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict—archivist vs. cartographer—is vividly embodied and drives her hesitation and eventual surrender to the smelting. The librarian’s motivation is consistent, though her interiority remains symbolic rather than psychologically granular. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (“storm of flux,” “looping in frantic spirals”), satisfying the 9+ quick test except for minor abstraction in the librarian’s portrayal. Final choice is earned with visible cost: Elara’s maps had dulled to checklists before renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—dissolving emotional walls after losing Mira—is compelling and consistently embodied through micro-choices (e.g., pausing before the override, extracting the shell). His internal contradiction between duty and connection sharpens at the climax. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from hardened inspector to bridge-builder feels swift despite strong setup. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between guilt and the need for truth—is embodied through tactile interactions (ivy, accordion, graffiti) rather than diagnostic self-talk. His micro-choices (climbing, playing, sketching) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, method over evasion. The final act of adding his own map mark earns self-forgiveness not as absolution but integration. Flawed yet coherent, his arc avoids sentimentality while delivering emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied emotion (“cautious exuberance bubbling,” “veil dampened, clinging like a second skin”) and micro-choices (documenting delays, interpreting runes) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation—seeking unspoken truths—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, the final transformation lacks a specific, dramatized cost beyond implied emotional weight; the “second letter’s shadow” remains abstract, weakening the felt price of her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict between legacy and artistry is vividly embodied through tactile details—trembling fingers, mulberry ache, coffee-stain divination—and her accidental telepathy deepens motivation without over-explaining. Her final choice feels earned because it arises from layered contradictions: desire for solitude vs. responsibility, silence vs. command. However, the resolution leans slightly toward idealized synthesis (“dream woven into empire”) without fully dramatizing the cost of compromise. The ivy’s directive risks externalizing agency, though Elara’s bowing remains the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirien’s motivation—to capture a spark before her own oblivion—is vividly embodied and drives every micro-choice with escalating stakes. Her internal contradiction (beautifier vs. mortician, self-sacrifice vs. survival) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final act of infusing her own spark is earned through prior causality and exacts visible cost: pain, near-extinction, then renewal. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through precise physicality (“trembling precision,” “pain lanced”).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “kindly decisive” grace, the tension between grief and duty, and her ancestral revelation feel earned. Her micro-choices (exiling kin, scalloping petals) reveal a clear hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, the epiphany via hairpin verges on convenient; the ancestral vision lacks struggle or doubt, softening the emotional contradiction that should complicate rebirth. Still, her final stance—surrender to the cycle—is credibly forged through action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alex’s interior conflict is vividly embodied—his certainty “hardening like frost,” his grip tightening on the shard—and his micro-choices (hesitating, listening to chimes, accepting the cloak) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. Elias functions effectively as a catalyst rather than a full character, which fits the scope. However, Alex’s epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“nuances guiding,” “forgiveness, collaboration over destruction”) that edges into therapy-speak without sufficient bodily grounding in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—premature aging from lab work—is clear and embodied, but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she shifts from desperation to epiphany without credible struggle. Voss’s backwards aging is visually striking but functions more as symbol than character with active pressure. The final realization (“teach vanishing to appear”) feels earned by the trance, yet the cost of vanishing remains abstract rather than viscerally felt in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thren’s motivation is consistent and deeply embodied—his weathered resolve and desire to “navigate without moving” shape every action. The wandering pulse syncs with his breath, creating a visceral interiority that avoids diagnostic labels. His endurance across decades reads as credible renunciation (Earned Stasis), not passive waiting. However, internal contradiction is muted; the story leans into singular devotion rather than simultaneous conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thorne’s underachievement and yearning for the handmade are embodied through concrete gestures—fizzling spells, hesitant unstrapping, mist-walking with garden-path focus. His internal contradiction (mediocrity vs. longing for sacred simplicity) drives every choice without diagnostic label-speak. The final grasp of the keystone feels earned because his micro-choices (loosening straps, stepping into mist) escalate from doubt to quiet agency. However, his emotional arc lacks a visible cost beyond implied societal irrelevance, slightly softening the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief and a luminous vow—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His interiority is embodied through tactile details (the key tag, silt under boots) rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice to enter the ship and open the book feels earned by his lamplighter instinct to “pierce the dark.” However, Lira’s transformation lacks sufficient friction or contradiction in Elias’s emotional arc; his acceptance borders on seamless, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—wavelength alignment against stellar doubt—is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (coin-casting, distilling bursts) and sustained by quiet enthusiasm that contrasts cosmic entropy. Her interior conflict between faith in the backwards prophecy and fear of dissolution feels specific and urgent, not abstract. However, her competence borders on infallibility; the coins never mislead, slightly softening struggle. The final broadcast choice is earned, with cost implied in peers’ failed fates.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s grief is embodied with visceral specificity—her trembling hands, dulled scythe, and crystallizing tears reveal internal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her motivation—to name fears that devoured Lirian—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (naming monsters) that exact emotional cost. The final act of naming Vorath crystallizes both terror and resolve, earning a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the lover’s voice in recordings leans slightly into convenient echo rather than fully dramatized memory, softening causality by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied doubt and brittle devotion, with micro-choices (e.g., refocusing after repair fails) revealing his hierarchy of values. His earnest naivety and lukewarm competence feel consistent and drive key decisions. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy—his shift from fragility to resilience lacks contradictory impulses in peak stress. Still, the final vow feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and morally textured—his guilt, vigilance, and yearning for redemption manifest through precise gestures (kneeling to lift the label, burning photos) rather than diagnostic labels. His contradiction—humane yet culpable—is sustained without safety-hedging. Mira’s presence functions as crucible: their shared act reconfigures his isolation into connection. The final choice to pass the sapphire label embodies a renunciation of solitary penance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—logic versus sentiment—is embodied through concrete choices: arranging elixirs yet yielding to starlings’ patterns, clutching letters while performing precise alchemy. Her micro-choices (lighting the flame, holding aloft the crystal) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. However, the “secretly sentimental” trait borders on label-only until the tears moment, slightly delaying full integration. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and her transformation feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his dread, precision, and isolation rendered through tactile detail (“fingers idly tested the parachute buckle”) and muscle memory rather than exposition. His motivation (preserving trust) intensifies under pressure and directly shapes high-stakes choices. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his emotional state emerges through action, not labels. However, Lena remains thinly realized beyond functional dialogue, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kai’s numbness is embodied through concrete action—gripping the Blade, seizing the jar—and his motivation (defeating void via complementarity) drives every choice. Elara functions effectively as pressure, not caricature, though her shift from dogma to fear lacks micro-beats of hesitation. The clone’s emergence as “complement” crystallizes Kai’s internal contradiction (void vs. wholeness) without therapy-speak. Final fusion feels earned, with numbness shattering via tactile sensation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to safeguard his creative space—is clear, consistent, and intensifies credibly as he decodes the seed. His "notably receptive" trait manifests through embodied choices (e.g., pressing the seed into earth with activation phrases), not just labels. However, internal contradiction is muted; his confidence borders on omniscience without struggle or misstep. The final vow feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond implied vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile actions—twitching fingers, phantom yanks on pull cords—and his mournful eagerness drives every beat. His internal contradiction (desire to restore joy vs. reliance on cacophony) manifests in physical choices, not abstract reflection. The spectral household functions as emotional pressure rather than active interlocutors, fitting Track A scope. However, the resolution leans slightly on conceptual endurance over a decisive character-driven pivot, capping full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The feral library guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—claws in frozen soil, rime-matted fur—and motivation (homesickness vs. embracing uncertainty) drives every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses (feral rage vs. lucid resolve) act simultaneously, especially when lunging “not in rage, but welcome.” The final renunciation of pure instinct for integration feels earned through prior causality and carries the cost of permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s stoic sensitivity is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., documenting failures in a frost-rimed journal) and contradictory impulses—quiet resolve pierced by hidden thorns—without diagnostic label-speak. His motivation intensifies credibly across three approximations, culminating in the decisive act of total destruction. The final renunciation of hopelessness is earned through repeated failure and insight, with visible cost in bodily chill and emotional ache. However, interiority occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“frozen hope”) over concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her creed and past trauma, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through embodied action—e.g., discarding her own creed as an assumption. Her micro-choices (using odd tools, shedding mental filters) align with her identity as a practical mystic. The flaw: her emotional state remains remarkably stable under extreme peril, lacking degradation or irrationality that would heighten realism.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in loyalty to the Dawn Runner—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure. His “resiliently positive” trait drives key choices (e.g., tuning the radio via patterns) and culminates in a meaningful endurance (merging timelines). However, his internal contradiction is underexplored; optimism reads more as unwavering than complexly conflicted. Parallel Elias briefly introduces friction but resolves too tidily without deepening Elias’s core flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fever, rational enchantments, and yearning for connection manifest through tactile weaving and shifting memories. His contradictory impulses (logic vs. longing) act simultaneously in scene, especially during the climactic weave. The final renunciation of illusion for sinew’s “resilient drag” feels earned, with clear cost: stable yet altered memories. However, secondary characters exist only as spectral echoes, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s motivation is vividly embodied through the chain link and his focused desire to navigate by starlight; Elara’s “balanced curiosity” directly informs her pedagogical choices and caution. Both characters reveal interiority through action—Kai clutching the relic, Elara turning it in her hands—not summary. Their micro-choices (e.g., Kai practicing controls, Elara projecting the hologram) align with consistent traits and stakes. However, Elara’s emotional cost (“shadow” in her gaze) feels slightly abstracted rather than dramatized through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., overriding caution to use the hearing aid) and consistent with her “persistently curious” trait. Clara’s arc feels credible, though slightly underdeveloped due to limited interaction time. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are conveyed through tactile responses (“fingers brushing the glass,” “sobs muffled in the reeling hush”). The final renunciation—Clara choosing life—is earned by Evelyn’s mediated plea, not external manipulation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is embodied with visceral specificity—“walls closing in like a vice,” “sweat beaded despite the chill”—and directly fuels her micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation (“to stand by the unremembered”) is consistent and intensifies credibly, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses retreat with tangible emotional cost. Internal conflict between panic and duty operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final act of remembrance feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test minus hairline slips in diagnostic phrasing (“phobia clawing at her chest like damp fingers” borders on label-speak).

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her heartbeat-counting ritual, porcelain talisman, and ink-defragmentation method reveal a psyche shaped by bureaucratic erasure and scientific hubris. Her motivation (“to fetch wisdom from failure”) directly fuels her actions, and her final realization feels earned through tactile, sensory engagement rather than abstraction. The ghost’s question (“Why count heartbeats?”) crystallizes her core fear of being an error, making her endurance a form of Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward resolved clarity too early, missing deeper contradictory impulses in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thorne’s motivation—to preserve tactile language through sound—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (copper veins dimming with loss) and intensifies credibly as elders die and children abandon the tongue. His final act is a renunciation of personal legacy in favor of communal preservation, foreclosing his own voice but etching the language into the canyon. Contradictory impulses—despair vs. ingenuity—act simultaneously in the tunnel scene without therapy-speak. The cost (his fading relevance) is felt in every micro-choice, especially clutching the “cursed” diamond despite its peril.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s bitterness and desire for cosmic retribution are vividly embodied through tactile reactions (frozen tears, clutching the arrowhead) and micro-choices (answering the phone, whispering her confession). Her internal contradiction—grief versus yearning for transformation—is sustained throughout and resolved in a metamorphosis that feels earned. The brother’s reappearance crystallizes relational stakes without melodrama. However, Mira’s late emergence lacks sufficient pressure to fully exploit the “relationships as crucible” potential.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, clutching the locust shell, and syncopated heartbeat all reveal a character defined by quiet defiance. Her internal contradiction (longing vs. logic) pulses through micro-choices, especially her decision to descend and uproot. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth. Final renunciation of mechanized order feels earned, though the cost remains more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in a personal loss of love across borders—is vividly embodied and consistently drives his micro-choices, especially in how he sorts mail and deploys drones. His “respectfully rebellious” stance manifests in deferential gestures that mask subversion, revealing a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through tactile details (e.g., the vial against his chest). However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy in its resolution, softening the ambiguity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s muteness as a vow is compellingly embodied through tactile, wordless action—especially his hum-as-song and chisel-work—but his internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see persistence without palpable resistance or doubt. His motivation is consistent yet borders on monolithic, lacking the friction of competing impulses that would elevate him beyond archetype. The final choice to rebuild feels earned, but the cost (decades of silence, isolation) is stated more than viscerally dramatized in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliza’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “sanely eccentric” pursuit of story-space, and her interiority—embodied through tactile ritual with the scarf and hyperbolic geometry—feels specific and consistent. Her micro-choices (unfurling the scarf, tracing tessellations) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over convention, analog over digital. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she never visibly wavers between immersion and restraint until the patron’s cough imposes external interruption, not internal struggle. The cost of her near-immersion is felt but not fully earned through prior psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her sister’s dying whisper—is consistent and intensifies credibly across dawns. Her internal conflict (longing vs. futility) manifests through embodied choices: trembling fingers, sweat-beaded brow, depletion of the palette. The final renunciation (“the dream did not return as flesh, but as memory vitalized”) is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from hollow yearning to “contentment” lacks a micro-irrationality or self-deception that would deepen authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The locksmith and the woman are vividly rendered through embodied longing and micro-choices—her clutching the lock of hair, his pocketing a strand—but their internal contradictions remain slightly abstracted by lyrical phrasing rather than visceral struggle. The final renunciation (his delayed self-liberation) is earned, yet the cost feels more thematic than tactile. Their motivations intensify coherently under pressure, though emotional states occasionally verge on diagnostic (“improbable longing,” “enveloped secrets”) without grounding in specific sensory contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—recovering stolen memories—is rooted in lifelong curiosity and professional identity, compellingly intensified by age-induced physical limitation. His interiority is concrete (“callused fingers,” “tears mingled with floodwater”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final act of reclamation feels earned through prior causality: his folklorist habits directly enable the memory recovery. However, the internal contradiction between scholarly detachment and emotional longing isn’t dramatized as simultaneous tension—it alternates rather than collides.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s combative tenderness and Kai’s trembling resilience are vividly embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., pacing backwards, gripping the scroll) revealing layered contradictions. Her backstory informs present action without overt exposition, and Kai’s growth feels earned through tactile struggle. The only limitation is slight flattening of Kai’s interiority—he reacts more than initiates—though his final sigil-tracing compensates. Flaws drive choices, and emotional complexity avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirien’s motivation—to preserve wonder—is consistent and embodied through his actions with the seed and pruning, but his internal conflict lacks contradiction; he operates as an archetype without struggle or blind spots. Elowen functions more as a symbol than a fully realized character, her despair stated rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices. The final choice (giving the seed) feels inevitable rather than earned through tension between competing impulses. No visible cost is borne by Lirien himself—his endurance lacks sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirien’s motivation—grounding spirits his brother failed to save—is concrete, consistent, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (grief vs. duty) manifests through embodied choices: kneeling in silt, piercing knots despite accumulating silence. The final act of mask restoration for the fisherman’s shade crystallizes his arc without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through porcelain shards and needlework.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his grief over his father’s silence directly fuels his empathetic interpretation of the chapel’s hush. His shielded openness cracks credibly at key moments, and micro-choices (emailing a colleague without coordinates, pocketing one letter) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in tactile actions (tears blurring vision, steady fingers despite chill). The final act of reopening the keystone feels earned by prior causality and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and scientific metaphor, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation—to understand “the physics of letting go”—is consistent and deepens through micro-choices (e.g., choosing solitude, releasing the snow globe). The Elias conceit risks abstraction but remains grounded in her psychological reality. Final renunciation (releasing the globe) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s motivation—to articulate hidden yearnings—is consistent and embodied through her actions with the lute, graffiti, and flower press plate. Her interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“heart's hidden yearnings”) rather than fully contradictory impulses under pressure. The ghost’s parallel plight deepens her arc, yet her final transformation lacks a tangible cost beyond implied emotional resonance. Micro-choices (mixing ink, aligning the plate) reveal values but feel harmonious rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied curiosity and emotional contradiction, especially in her trembling yet resolute handling of the diary. Her motivation—seeking joy beneath anguish—is consistent and intensifies credibly as revelations mount. The final realization that she is Elowen’s child feels earned by prior micro-choices (donning goggles, persisting through pain). However, the “affectionate detachment” trait borders on diagnostic label-speak in the closing line, slightly undercutting full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—proving empty spaces remember—is vividly rooted in grief for Lira, and his interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak despite emotional intensity. His micro-choices (logging cloud emotions, folding the origami gondola) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: tethering his life to her memory. However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy—grief resolves into transcendent clarity without sufficient contradictory friction under stratospheric duress.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness isn’t a gimmick but the engine of her perception and craft—her fractal precision arises directly from her inability to rely on facial symmetry. Her internal contradiction (limitation as liberation) acts continuously in-scene, not as summary. Every micro-choice—from tracing shelves to affixing mirrors at 23.7 degrees—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time, focus, legacy. The final renunciation (leaving the sky-mirror to ruin) is earned by prior causality and embodies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in curiosity and discovery, consistently driving her actions. Her interiority feels specific—chattering to herself, treating objects as companions—but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotional conflict under pressure. The resolution stems from competence rather than struggle, and her isolation is stated more than dramatized as a cost. Final choice is earned but without visible sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—learning “the rhythm of repair”—is deeply rooted in paternal loss and consistently embodied through tactile memory (driftwood nostalgia, gear handling). His internal conflict between longing and mechanical precision manifests in micro-choices: trembling reverence while selecting gears, sweat beading in freeze. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but of grief’s paralysis—repair becomes active legacy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory anchors (crystallizing breath, prismatic ghosts), not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characters are vividly individuated through voice and micro-choices (e.g., Kael’s grumble paired with steadying hands), and their collective arc from strangers to family feels earned. However, interior contradictions remain implied rather than dramatized in-scene—Elara’s doubt or Mira’s fear are stated but not embodied under pressure. The ghost Lir lacks agency-driven motivation, functioning more as plot device than character. Still, relationships serve as crucible, and the final act crystallizes their reconfigured unity with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—soothing lost souls through a lullaby—is rooted in centuries of witnessed suffering and crystallizes credibly in his final act. His interiority is vividly embodied (“hands trembling from the chill,” “smiled through tears”), and his micro-choice to sing despite exhaustion reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The puppet head functions as both companion and catalyst, grounding his emotional arc without sentimentality. However, his backstory lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; grief drives him purely, missing internal friction that would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reluctance, grief, and grudging duty are embodied through tactile detail (“callused hands,” “grumbling,” “heart thudded gracelessly”) and micro-choices (flicking nuts without touching stone). His motivation—atonement for past failures—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Interior contradiction is clear: he hates the duty but acts anyway. The final renunciation (“He’d do it again, cursing all the while”) earns an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, guilt, and scientific mindset intertwine in tactile perception (e.g., tracing foam, cradling the chrysalis). His motivation stems credibly from past choices, and his epiphany feels earned through sensory engagement rather than abstraction. However, the transition from despair to resolve leans slightly on lyrical assertion (“grief loosened further”) without a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path. The final lab action confirms change but arrives off-stage, weakening the immediacy of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—seeking origin through quantified absence—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies credibly. His internal conflict (vendor of erasure yet trapped in looping narrative) manifests as simultaneous impulses: curation vs. dissolution, control vs. surrender. Micro-choices (selecting slate, uncorking moonlight, incising voids) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost (abandoning shop, descending into vortex). Final renunciation is earned by prior causality; the "vendor’s mask cracking" crystallizes his transformation without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elaris’s motivation—sandpapering remorse—is vividly embodied through sensory detail and culinary ritual, not therapy-speak. His internal contradiction (isolation vs. healing others) drives credible micro-choices: kneeling, tasting, enduring contagion. The final act of subsuming collective grief earns his emotional release without tidy resolution. Flawed yet competent, he remains consistent, though the backstory block slightly exceeds BRR limits without immediate micro-choice anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as a harmonious choral librarian, and her “empathetically decisive” trait drives concrete actions like rallying crews and constructing the bridge. Her interiority blends tenderness with resolve, though some emotional states verge on lyrical abstraction (“vigorously tender”) rather than fully embodied contradiction. The final choice—using her voice to weave languages—is earned by prior causality, and the cost (social fracture averted) is felt. However, secondary characters remain archetypal, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—engineer versus dream-archeologist, precision versus chaos—but her transformation leans on diagnostic phrasing like “helix-minded” and “synaptic plasticity” without sufficient dramatization of struggle. The cost of her reinvention is felt abstractly rather than viscerally; we see her trembling hands but not the tangible sacrifice of her former life. Her final fusion with the periscope lacks a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a prior path, weakening the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “prism-minded” nature and archival drive, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“latent blaze simmered in her veins”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—tracing the doodle, leaping into the threshold—are consistent with her traits and escalate under pressure. However, internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized; we see focused determination but little simultaneous struggle or self-deception that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent, with micro-choices—like threading silver strings or strumming with quartz—that reveal his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict between grief for lost sound and hope for rebirth pulses through tactile actions rather than exposition. However, the absence of true contradictory impulses (e.g., doubt vs. faith) in-scene prevents full 9+ eligibility. The hedgehog and siskins function as ambient witnesses, not relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile memory (the dent in the stone) and precise action, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His motivation—to find beauty in struggle—is dramatized through chess logic and exile-born resilience. The final choice to realign the covenant via pawn-like sacrifice feels earned, with melancholy cost palpable in his unbroken exile. However, internal contradiction remains muted; his precision borders on infallibility, softening the friction between flaw and action.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictions feel vividly embodied—his pacifism, musicality, and trauma inform every micro-choice. His struggle to open the diary via resonance (not force) aligns perfectly with his ethos. However, interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“empathy's first lesson: listen beyond noise”) that borders on label-speak. The final act of writing before the fireworks shows credible endurance with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory sensitivity create a vivid interior contradiction—her desire for serenity clashes with her acute olfactory torment, driving micro-choices like sketching through nausea. Her transformation from conquest to harmony feels earned through embodied struggle, not epiphany. However, the final renunciation lacks a concrete, on-page cost beyond emotional shift; no tool, relationship, or opportunity is visibly forfeited. This near-miss prevents 9+ despite strong motivation and consistent traits.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—grief-driven, specific, and tied to her brother’s death—is embodied in every choice, especially her risky ascent and theft of the arrow tip. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through gaunt cheeks, breath in silence, boots sinking into moss. The final act—planting the artifact—carries visible cost (moral ambiguity of extraction) and forecloses passive waiting. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. desperation) act simultaneously during the cavern descent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—“to cultivate foresight in action”—is embodied through precise, professional micro-choices (deploying anemometers, recalibrating paths by gusts) rather than abstract longing. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion surfaces via tactile detail (“gloved fingers brushing,” “pulse quickened”). The flight patch functions as both talisman and ethical anchor, driving his final transmission. However, his rapid adaptation lacks visible struggle or cost beyond environmental friction, slightly softening the flaw-complication dynamic required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elyra’s motivation—to certify wonder as essential—is vividly rooted in her role and sensory gifts, and her internal conflict (doubt vs. devotion) pulses through embodied hesitation and action. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized resolve without sufficient friction from tangible cost; the “spent amber sheet” implies sacrifice but doesn’t viscerally register as loss. Her synesthetic perception enriches interiority, yet the absence of a second character limits relational pressure that could deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elaron’s motivation is clear and rooted in shame and duty, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, crunching boots) and micro-choices (arranging driftwood, playing the flute) that reveal his hierarchy of values. His epiphany—failure from isolation, not weakness—is earned through on-page confrontation with spectral thieves. However, interiority occasionally leans into diagnostic phrasing (“hubris that blinded him”) that borders on label-speak, slightly undercutting the rawness expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—quantifying emotion through transposed empathy—is vividly embodied in his actions, ink-stained hands, and borrowed personalities. His internal contradiction (calm curiosity vs. feverish obsession) drives the climax, and Mira’s presence forces a meaningful exchange that costs him his emotional equilibrium. The flaw: his shift into full mimicry of Mira borders on diagnostic (“borrowing her personality fully”) without sufficient physical grounding mid-crisis. Still, the final renunciation of borrowed dread feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s jittery embodiment, tactile connection to the pendant, and layered motivation (“to coax wonder from the routine”) are consistently rendered through micro-choices (offering the relic despite suspicion) and embodied emotion (twitching fingers, voice cracking). His internal contradiction—between weary routine and yearning for Thorne’s mythic legacy—is active in-scene, not summarized. Lira’s weariness and latent dreams emerge through concrete sensory exchange rather than exposition. The only slight flaw: Lira’s transformation leans slightly on implied epiphany over dramatized choice, though her clutching the pendant and vow “I’ll carry on” ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—scientist versus mystic—is embodied through precise sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., pressing palm to frosted glass, tracing frost with a finger). His emotional repression (“truthful lies”) fuels credible self-deception that shatters organically under pressure. The climax reveals layered grief without therapy-speak, and his final shift to “wonder’s truth” feels earned by prior causality. Minor deduction: the father’s rage appears late but integrates cleanly via chassis vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her mute sacrifice, longing for reunion, and weaving as conduit—but her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied in simultaneous impulses. Emotions are evocatively rendered yet occasionally verge on label-speak (“wistful core,” “latent sacrifice”). Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (life force dimming), satisfying the 9+ quick test threshold, though not fully reaching it due to slight emotional summarization at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elar’s motivation is rooted in loss and expressed through embodied labor, not exposition. His quiet determination manifests in micro-choices—hauling rubble, weaving silk—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: meekness vs. defiance, grief vs. creation. The final stance feels earned, though emotional progression leans slightly tidy for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her cyclic spontaneity, sensory perception, and conflicted drive toward truth feel specific and consistent. Her micro-choices (gripping the shard, redirecting twice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her final acceptance lacks sufficient friction; the betrayal revelation doesn’t visibly alter her tactics before resolution, softening the emotional credibility of her endurance. The mentor’s echo delivers exposition that resolves internal conflict too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and warmth are embodied through micro-choices—brushing stone stacks, pocketing sea glass—that reveal his values without exposition. Harlan’s coughing frailty and coded notes deepen motivation credibly. The final act of rebuilding the stack earns his shift from observer to protector with visible cost: he breaks silence, accepts burden. However, Harlan’s emotional arc leans slightly on summary (“found solace in replying”) rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—shaping a new dawn through ancient shadows—is vividly embodied in his laughter, trembling fingers, and decisive manipulation of the lantern. His internal contradiction (joy laced with abyssal chill) manifests physically and drives his climactic choice. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action (“tears of manic glee,” “chortled as shadows stirred”). His transformation from routine keeper to world-shaper feels earned by prior causality and carries the cost of abandoning centuries of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s interiority is vividly embodied through her dye master’s precision and post-transplant disorientation, with micro-choices (angling the wing, listening selectively) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her motivation intensifies credibly as narrative magnetism becomes both gift and threat. The “quietly explosive” heart flaw drives her arc without safety-hedging, and the final Charged Poise—listening with enriched vigilance—earns its cost: the burden of perpetual story-attracting. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“donor, a legendary tale-weaver…”) rather than fully dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover what trees witness—is embodied in tactile, specific actions (mending stone, collecting dreams) and contradicted by his role as a fixer of human instruments rather than natural truths. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; sorrow is felt through brass arms “bent like grieving limbs,” not named. The final choice—to reassemble the sextant for earthbound mapping—emerges from accumulated micro-decisions under moonlight pressure. Cost is legible: decades of labor redirected toward a quiet, rooted epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as memory keeper, and her micro-choices—humming specific songs under duress—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied sensation (“pain lanced Elara's temples”) and sensory contradiction. However, the spectral communities remain archetypal rather than individuated, limiting relational crucible depth. The final transformation from “scattered memory keeper” to “dawn-weaver” is earned through cumulative song-weaving under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between reclusion and connection, regret and redemption—is embodied through micro-choices (pocketing the invitation, guiding the young man) that feel consistent and consequential. Her empathy drives action, not just observation, and her transformation from recluse to guardian is earned by prior causality. However, the young man remains underdeveloped; his desperation functions more as a catalyst than a crucible. The final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost: she leaves her old self behind while staying physically present.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his guilt over passive noticing coexists with active gardening, embodying his “creeping normality noticer” trait without diagnostic self-awareness. His micro-choices (offering bread unprompted, pruning at the end) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet reparation. Mira’s arrival deepens his arc through shared history rather than exposition, and their reconciliation feels earned by prior emotional groundwork. The only slight flaw: Mira’s motivation leans slightly reactive, though her confession grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rendered and consistent, anchored in his role as records chief, yet his interiority remains largely abstract—emotions are stated (“heart quickened”) rather than embodied through specific physiological or behavioral contradiction. The trait “gently meticulous” recurs but functions more as a stylistic refrain than a driver of micro-choices with tangible trade-offs. His endurance qualifies as Earned Stasis, though the cost (library drifting lower) feels atmospheric rather than personally exacted. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, keeping focus clean but limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s motivation—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is vividly embodied and consistently drives her actions. Her “curiously steadfast” trait avoids abstraction by manifesting in repeated, costly attempts despite failure. Internal conflict is shown through physical tension (clutching the fob, voice cracking) rather than diagnostic labels. However, Thorne and the runner remain functional archetypes, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s skepticism and synesthetic perception are vividly embodied, and her shift from doubt to awe feels earned through sensory escalation. However, the final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over micro-choice—her decision to join the weather-walkers is implied but not dramatized as an active renunciation or trade-off. The internal contradiction (skepticism vs. wonder) pulses throughout, yet the cost of her change remains abstract rather than concretely foreclosing a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between suppressed artistry and pragmatic denial—is embodied with specificity (charcoal-stained fingers, mnemonic precision) and drives micro-choices (drawing the lock, retrieving spare parts). His motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, and his final act of sketching anew feels earned. However, the emotional shift at the end leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the “laughter carrying no regret” risks smoothing over the cost too cleanly for a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her truth-sensitive art—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to descend into Veridia’s underlevels. Her embodied reactions to dishonesty (wilting, pallor) are concrete and character-specific, not diagnostic labels. Internal conflict emerges subtly through her yearning for lost candor versus the city’s pervasive deceit. The final renunciation—accepting that unspoken truths are the real loss—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied—her seasonal muteness and devotion to wonder drive concrete choices (forging bells, hollowing ice). Her internal contradiction (muted vigor vs. creative urgency) acts in-scene, especially during the sculpture’s construction. The boy’s awakening shows her impact without sentimentality. However, her emotional arc lacks a decisive renunciation or cost beyond implied labor; endurance is credible but not charged with personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zeta’s motivation—resolving inner static through nostalgic duty—is vividly embodied in tactile actions (tending thorns, activating manipulators) and internal contradictions (nostalgia vs. primal urges). Its android nature grounds emotional responses in programmed memory rather than human cliché. The final renunciation of fear via fire feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in shattered memories and strained servos. However, the transition from fragmentation to resolution leans slightly on conceptual neatness over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent—her belief that listening heals—but her interiority remains largely abstract (“discerning curator,” “sandstorm calm”) without embodied contradiction or struggle. Supporting characters serve as plot devices rather than crucibles; their stories feed the puzzle, not mutual transformation under pressure. The final renunciation (embracing communal healing over individual curation) is credible but lightly earned, lacking a tangible cost beyond implied emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to encrypt vulnerability as strength—is compellingly rooted in her history of being mocked, and her calm defiance under pressure feels earned. Her internal contradiction (poetic fragility vs. cryptographic rigor) manifests physically through dance and dice-rolling, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to revive colleagues deepens her arc beyond solitary genius into collective resilience, with clear cost in hull instability. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from isolation to solidarity lacks friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—recovering deleted memories—is rooted in tactile, embodied detail (pressed wildflowers) and drives escalating choices under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through physical strain (damp petals, erratic gravity tugging his boots). The final act—embedding the heart among crystals—earns closure via renunciation of personal recovery for communal restoration, with visible cost: abandonment of his lantern duty, symbolizing his former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—to hush a coded prophecy through “smoothed hush”—is clear and consistent, driving his ritual with emotional weight. However, interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction (“tranquil blaze,” “terrestrially cosmic”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His struggle lacks tangible friction; the prophecy’s threat remains conceptual, not visceral. The final renunciation feels earned thematically but not psychologically, missing a moment where doubt or cost fractures his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and intensifies credibly, driving her to interrogate Harlan—a high-stakes choice that crystallizes her arc. Her internal contradiction (yearning for truth vs. playing along with lies) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Harlan’s patient facade masks his own complicity, revealed through micro-choices like sealing notes and tracing the desk seal. Both characters feel specific, not archetypal, though Elara’s emotional progression slightly smooths under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “charmed skeptic” nature manifests in trembling fingers that weave resonance structures while doubt wars with belief. Her tragic radiance isn’t just described; it refracts starlight into grief-prisms, grounding emotion in sensory specificity. The quarantined memory operates as both wound and engine, driving her toward archiving as renunciation. However, the final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over earned micro-choice—her shift from haunted to whole hinges more on ritual completion than a series of pressured decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—forgiving his unfinished apprenticeship—is compelling and rooted in specific emotional history. His internal conflict between calibrated vengeance and self-liberation manifests through embodied choices (e.g., using blood-ink, piercing old scars). However, his epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“wisdom had endured through exile’s chill”) rather than raw, contradictory feeling under pressure. The final renunciation is earned but lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path beyond symbolic unmaking.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elyra’s motivation—rooted in her perception and the central riddle of echoes—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (progressive disclosure, selective sharing) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over alliance, perception over silence. However, secondary characters remain underdeveloped archetypes (oracle, merchant, guardian), limiting relational crucibles. The final renunciation—walking alone—earns stasis with visible cost: isolation as the price of attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage purity from wreckage—is embodied through tactile interaction with the snow globe and reinforced by micro-choices that reveal her ethical rigor (“never yanking spirits... but coaxing them thread by thread”). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing guilt, reverence, and resolve through sensory perception and action. The final renunciation of vengeance in favor of truth-weaving earns an Earned Stasis with visible cost: ghosts freed, betrayal exposed, but no personal gain beyond the locket. Flaws are present (her obsession borders on recklessness) yet never safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile rituals (whisking tea, mending nets) and his philosophy emerges from concrete labor, not abstraction. His motivation—to honor hidden effort—is consistent and deepened by memory and action. However, the absence of genuine internal contradiction or struggle (e.g., doubt, fatigue, resentment) flattens emotional complexity; his epiphany feels serene rather than earned through friction. The final renunciation lacks visible cost—no path is truly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—truth-seeker versus protector of fragile hope—is embodied in micro-choices (reburying the diamond, pocketing one fragment) with tangible cost. His motivation evolves credibly from debunker to guardian without epiphany, grounded in observation and pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through action (mask fogging, juice on tongue). Final renunciation is earned by prior causality: his own methods reveal a truth too dangerous to expose.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and internal conflict are vividly rendered through concrete sensory detail and micro-choices (e.g., etching lyrics on fogged glass, laughing “a ragged sound lost in the wind”). However, his transformation from hermit to prophet lacks a decisive internal turn—his acceptance of leadership feels assumed rather than earned through struggle. Mira’s betrayal is underdeveloped as a crucible; her variant allegiance resolves via magical coercion, not character-driven pressure. The final doubt (“would blind or burn”) hints at complexity but arrives too late to reconfigure his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—translating lost voices for the young—is vividly embodied through his ritual of sound-capturing and sweetening, revealing internal contradiction between isolation and connection. His redemption arc feels earned via concrete micro-choices: winding the music box, blending essences, offering jars to strangers. The elder’s tearful reaction validates his purpose with palpable emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” interiority is vividly embodied—his calibration of the resonator merges memory, grief, and technical precision. The contradiction between rational assessment and visceral longing (“fleshly ethereal embrace”) feels authentic under pressure. His micro-choices (sprinting to the tower, tuning rather than fleeing) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: risking his life to enact absolution. However, the lover backstory arrives as a single reflective block without altering a present micro-choice, slightly weakening BRR compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict—wildness versus restraint—is embodied in precise physical details (“fingers itched,” “heart a storm restrained”) and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses impulsive action with felt cost. Her motivation stems from consistent traits, and the mentor relationship applies immediate pressure without diluting focus. However, the final transformation leans slightly on declarative summary (“impatience sculpted into patience”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices at the apex of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her empirical discipline clashes with involuntary visions, and her micro-choices (kneeling, logging inscriptions, hurling the phone) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The parallel between Lila and Marcus emerges organically through embodied memory rather than exposition. However, the transition from passive observer to decisive actor leans slightly on the lantern’s mystical trigger rather than fully earned internal causality. Still, the final renunciation carries visible cost and credible emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s guilt and moral reckoning are embodied through tactile details—clutching the box, throat tightness—and his micro-choices (bringing the box, listening to Harrow) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His flaw (judgment without listening) directly caused Marcus’s despair, and the interior contradiction between pastoral duty and personal failure is sustained without therapy-speak. However, Harrow borders on archetype; his wisdom feels slightly too convenient, diluting the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” trait is embodied through micro-choices—snatching the arrow tip, using the kaleidoscope, etching circuits—that escalate with coherent motivation. Her internal contradiction (awe vs. hubris) surfaces in voice and action without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t of desire but of solitude: she rings a bell “no one hears yet,” accepting obscurity as cost. Flawlessly consistent interiority, though emotional range narrows slightly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “brightly attentive” trait drives micro-choices with tangible cost—forging a timestamp, risking her job—but her internal contradiction (duty vs. truth-seeking) lacks simultaneous tension; emotions are embodied (“heart pounding”) yet occasionally veer toward diagnostic phrasing (“motivation surged”). The lie feels earned by prior obsession, and her final endurance (“carrying the weight”) forecloses her corporate role with quiet poise. However, Lena exists only as archival residue, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thorne’s motivation is clear and consistent—mapping empathy onto action—and her “courageous anomaly” status informs every choice without veering into diagnostic label-speak. Her interiority remains embodied (“shadows coiling from her sleeves,” “fingers danced over the fragment”) rather than abstract. The dryad and wraith are functional foils, not fully dimensional, but their roles serve the single-POV pressure cleanly. Final renunciation of conflict through reconstituted empathy feels earned by her intuitive trait and prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motivation—seeking the “sound of approaching endings”—is compellingly rooted in her past as a euthanasia tourist and sharpened by Arctic extremity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile details (e.g., frayed lace, cool brass) and micro-choices like volunteering despite instability. Tomas functions as both mirror and catalyst, his quiet presence forcing Liora toward witness rather than extraction. The loss of the parasol tip signals earned renunciation, not epiphany, with cost felt in her unmoored yet anchored state.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied sensations and specific emotional textures, but Theo borders on archetype—his backstory feels illustrative rather than causally urgent. The “destined mismatch” epiphany leans into diagnostic phrasing (“bodies entwined but souls adrift”) that edges toward label-speak without sufficient micro-choice grounding. Elena’s final resolve lacks a concrete action or renunciation that forecloses a tangible path; her departure reads as mood-shift rather than earned endurance. Motivation is clear but not fully pressured by irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line walker’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in preservation, and his “strangely honest” trait shapes key choices. His micro-decisions—closing central gaze, conjuring clearings, using peripheral awareness—are embodied and pressure-driven. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he functions more as an archetype than a conflicted individual. The prophet and seekers remain atmospheric, not crucibles of relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—transmuting pain into art—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. She remains perceptively calm throughout without meaningful struggle or trade-offs that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Her actions align with motive, yet no visible cost arises from her choices; the townsfolk’s healing feels granted rather than earned through her sacrifice. The character functions more as a catalytic archetype than a flawed individual with blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s reticence and weathered innocence are embodied through precise physical detail (“creased lids,” “voice like old parchment”) and consistent micro-choices (humming, clutching the crystal). Her motivation—to decode language’s fractal growth—emerges credibly from her scholarly identity and intensifies under pressure. The final testimony is earned by prior causality: each echo deepens her resolve. However, internal contradiction remains muted; her transformation leans toward epiphany over struggle, slightly softening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness and tidal longing form a coherent, contradictory interiority that drives every action. His micro-choices—arranging driftwood, inscribing runes, pressing record—are physically embodied expressions of his struggle against oblivion. The final renunciation isn’t of the quest but of drift: he accepts transience while capturing one echo, earning stasis through effort. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in wire-threaded beards and chalk-dust marrow.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—harnessing the ephemeral—is deeply rooted in his identity as a sage repairer and consistently drives micro-choices under pressure. His interiority is vividly embodied (“luminous ache,” hands steadied by decades), and his struggle balances competence with genuine vulnerability. The final act of syncing clock to leaf descent feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in lost apprentices and trembling hydroponics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and Harlan’s emotional arc feels earned through embodied detail—tears carving paths, clutching the vinyl shard. However, Lena’s arrival and reconciliation lack sufficient friction or internal contradiction; her shift from estranged to embracing feels under-pressured. Elara herself borders on idealized competence without visible struggle, weakening the “decisively kind” trait’s cost. The final choice (reunification) is resonant but leans on Elara’s orchestration more than Harlan’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—tracing shadows at noon—is consistent, embodied in her precise actions, and intensifies credibly through tactile engagement with runes and automatons. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing obsession through micro-choices like stylus strokes and breath control. The flaw: minimal internal contradiction; she faces no meaningful doubt or competing impulse, reducing emotional complexity. Still, her endurance feels earned, and the cost—hours of nocturnal labor—is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. yearning—is embodied in tactile choices (setting the tooth like a bone) and evolves credibly. Her “shrewd innocence” shifts from mask to integrated stance, with cost legible in her relinquished certainty. Motivation intensifies coherently from professional duty to spiritual realignment. However, the transition from skepticism to belief leans slightly on lyrical assertion rather than fully dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—grief and resolve alternate rather than collide. Her micro-choices (polishing sea glass, presenting it to the village) align with her vow, yet the emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution over messy authenticity. The final renunciation of fire feels earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral. A stronger embodiment of her earthbound limitation during action would have elevated this.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., unclasping the pendant), and her motivation—grafting meaning onto pain—is consistent and compelling. Kai’s presence functions credibly as a mirror to shared trauma, though his emotional arc leans slightly on exposition (“your words gave mine a shape”). The “protected vulnerability” tone is well-sustained, but the final exchange borders on thematic articulation rather than subtext. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and the amber pendant anchors both memory and action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal conflict is vividly embodied through tactile gestures (tracing the seashell, kneeling in fog) and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values—preserving hope over surrender. His motivation intensifies credibly as each cameo appearance deepens his resolve. However, the secondary characters exist only as projections, lacking reciprocal pressure or relationship dynamics. The final renunciation of despair feels earned, though the emotional progression leans slightly tidy given the lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s whimsy and resolve are vividly embodied—her tinkering, laughter, and song reveal a coherent, contradictory interiority. Motivation is rooted in generational memory, not abstraction, and her micro-choices (e.g., humming forgotten songs) directly alter the world. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational pressure, and internal conflict leans more toward steadfastness than simultaneous contradiction. Still, her final renunciation of further tinkering conveys earned stasis with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lir’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and alchemical ritual, with interiority rendered through embodied sensation (“veins bulging like roots,” “phantom beats”) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—pressing palm to frozen earth, arranging refuse with heartbeat precision—reveal a hierarchy of values where patience becomes active devotion. The final decision to follow Eira’s mapped path feels earned by every prior act of attunement. No emotional flatness or safety-hedging; loss is directional, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—storing wonder against forgetfulness—is consistent and intensifies through his obsessive harvesting of echoes. His reflective nature manifests in embodied choices: peripheral focus, precise angle calibrations, filament threading. Internal conflict surfaces subtly in his isolation versus desire to preserve connection through sound. However, emotional progression lacks a pivotal contradiction; his endurance feels smooth rather than fraught with competing impulses that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to collect burdens—is vividly embodied through her ritual and emotional responses, particularly in her visceral reaction to the thief’s fractal. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through sensory perception (“panic flickered like the lamp’s flame”). The contradiction between her desire to transcend and her entrapment in recursion feels earned. However, her transformation lacks a micro-choice that actively renounces or affirms her path; she is acted upon by the weaves rather than decisively choosing calcification.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile rituals (carving, crystal handling) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release Theo) drive micro-choices that feel earned. The “hauntingly practical” ethos shapes her actions with visible cost: she sacrifices immediacy (ignoring the boiling kettle) to contain memory. Final renunciation—choosing containment over despair—is rooted in consistent traits and prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between relentless scavenging and the need for reconciliation with his past self—is rendered through embodied regret, micro-choices (cranking the wheel, offering it), and consistent resoluteness turned inward. His ghost isn’t a gimmick but a psychological manifestation that forces reckoning. The final renunciation (“step back,” “pocketed the empty wheel”) is earned by prior accumulation of regret shards. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions coil like serpents, not summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—“equations for hope”—is vividly embodied through micro-choices: redirecting flows, calibrating the sextant, rerouting coolant. Her “functionally creative” trait drives action under pressure without over-explaining. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; wonder is stoic, not sentimental. The final Charged Poise (“walked out into the light”) earns closure with visible cost: time spent, solitude embraced, decay confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s introversion and trauma around sound are embodied with precision—his “excruciatingly gentle” motions, tactile relationship to the music box, and internal conflict between clockwork precision and melody feel consistent and specific. The shift from repression to integration is earned through micro-choices (kneeling, winding) that carry emotional cost. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“his solitude had been the dream’s quiet evolution, not its grave”) rather than fully dramatized discovery, softening interior contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to understand the architecture of lies—is compellingly rooted in his profession and history, and his internal clarity contrasts meaningfully with the deceptive world he navigates. His micro-choices (gauging depth, probing wreckage) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on truth over treasure. However, his emotional state remains largely cerebral; the “serene upheaval” is stated more than embodied, limiting the visceral impact of his transformation. The final renunciation of errancy feels earned but lacks a tangible personal cost beyond shifted perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve ancient methods—is embodied through tactile, patient actions, not just stated. His internal conflict (preservation vs. modernity’s erasure) manifests in micro-choices: using fulgurite glass, decoding knots without force. Kael evolves believably from gruff resistance to collaborative awe, his status shifting as knowledge is shared. Both characters avoid archetype through idiosyncratic speech and worldview-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief for his vanished sister maps onto the garden’s decay, and his micro-choices (kneeling, binding the thread, writing specific obituaries) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on understanding absence. His motivation—to chart healing’s geography—is consistent and intensifies through ritual acts. However, secondary characters exist only as projections, limiting interpersonal crucibles; this is acceptable under single-POV scope but prevents full 9+ integration. The final renunciation of nomadic ache feels earned, with visible emotional cost in his tears and lighter steps.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elarion’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile actions and obsessive hypothesizing, revealing a psyche fractured by loss yet driven by yearning. His contradictory impulses—hope versus fatalism—act simultaneously in the climax as he both creates and mourns beauty. The chick’s emergence crystallizes his internal conflict without tidy resolution, and his micro-choices (e.g., weaving wires as “stolen lightning”) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: emotional vulnerability over mechanical certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—burn scars, grafting ritual, inherited trauma—and her motivation (“to prove that scars can sing”) drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between her father’s destruction and her restorative compassion operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Her competence as a firefighter informs her alertness without flattening her vulnerability. Final renunciation of vengeance in favor of healing is earned through tactile, precise action with visible cost: the grafted union itself.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—skepticism warring with imaginative hope—and her luminous trait functions as both metaphor and physical marker. Her micro-choices (e.g., resisting haste, tracing breadcrumbs) reveal a hierarchy of values grounded in sidereal patience. However, the story leans slightly on label-like phrasing (“luminous skeptic,” “realistically imaginative”) without always dramatizing the tension between those traits in high-pressure beats. The final act feels earned, but the emotional cost of liberation remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s motivation—to share light without fire—is consistent, embodied in her handling of the gear and her retreat from prophecy. Her sentimentality is rendered through concrete perception (“quiet ache for lineages lost”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (embedding the gear) forecloses her lineage’s tragic path with visible cost: her form dims, her vigil becomes eternal. However, interior contradiction remains slightly muted—her struggle leans more elegiac than actively torn.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, craft, and longing interwoven through tactile memory and poetic ritual. His motivation (to map collective sorrow) intensifies credibly across the migration, culminating in a resonant renunciation of isolation. Contradictory impulses—solitude versus connection, stone versus silk—are active in scene, not summarized. The final choice to “trade poems anew” feels earned by ancestral mentorship and personal reckoning, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully rooted in guilt and ethical diligence, with interior contradiction embodied through tactile memory and micro-choices (e.g., resisting shortcuts, anonymous confession). His final act—pressing the rake handle to the pendulum—is earned by decades of penitential precision. The “searing reverie” avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring emotion in sensory flashbacks tied to inscriptions. However, the rival’s widow appearing “smiling in recent market” leans slightly toward convenient absolution without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s blithe demeanor contrasts effectively with the gloom, and his motivation—to decode spectral intentions—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (e.g., tracing threads like arranging petals). However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; he moves with serene certainty, flattening emotional complexity. The final renunciation isn’t a sacrifice but a quiet fulfillment, costing him nothing tangible. His competence borders on effortless, undercutting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in principled defiance of stagnation, and his internal conflict—doubt versus conviction—is embodied through physical actions (recalibrating models, clutching the quill) rather than abstract introspection. His micro-choices (e.g., selecting fungal lights over overt rebellion) reveal a hierarchy of values that prioritize sustainable change over spectacle. However, his emotional arc lacks a tangible cost beyond implied risk; the enforcers’ arrival doesn’t force a sacrifice that alters his state, weakening the "felt cost" requirement for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every key choice. Her internal conflict between preservation and rebellion is rendered through tactile actions (copying scores, broadcasting lyrics) rather than abstraction. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves from yearning to triumph without meaningful hesitation or self-doubt under pressure. The final renunciation of direct authorship (“dust now told stories in her stead”) feels earned but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to crystallize a fleeting emotion—is vividly embodied in ritual action and micro-choices (selecting rare paper, omitting painful memories), revealing interior contradiction between truth and comfort. His flawed artifice (“weaves truth carefully… letting incomplete information shape a vision purer than reality”) deepens character without therapy-speak. The mask removal at the end shows credible endurance with visible cost: “mask weighed heavier now… truths ever prone to shatter.” However, the mother exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible; this single-POV piece compensates well but lacks a second on-page character to pressure his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve ancient chronometric methods against mythic revisionism—is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict between rational certainty and creeping doubt is embodied in tactile actions (clutching the cog, sifting ash) rather than abstract rumination. The final choice to fuse the cog with its twin demonstrates credible endurance with visible cost: he abandons isolation for confrontation, risking his life’s work to prove a point. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy—his doubt resolves too cleanly into action without lingering hypocrisy or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “traveled stillness” and “expectantly resigned” stance manifest in micro-choices like damping zither overtones to model emotional excision. Secondary characters (Joren, Lira, scholar) evolve credibly through voice shifts that reflect unlearning, not epiphany. However, their transformations lean slightly toward convergence under pressure, softening individual contradictions at the climax. The final braid feels earned but borders on tidy given the depth of prior hatred.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—creating beauty from ruins through gentle rebellion—is vividly embodied in his pruning, tasting of memories, and planting. His “informally wise” voice feels authentic, not diagnostic, and his micro-choices (pruning specific vines, whispering to dead plants) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his internal contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told he rebels gently but don’t see him wrestle with the risk or cost mid-action. The final renunciation—slipping away to cook—feels earned but lacks a visible sacrifice beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied in voice, micro-choices (offering the riddle box), and emotional cost—his bluntness isolates him yet fuels his mission to preserve wonder. Mira’s sharpness and fatigue are rendered through action (“slapped her coins,” “grease-streaked overalls”) and reaction to the riddle, avoiding diagnostic labels. Their brief interaction crystallizes mutual stakes without sentimentality. The final choice—Elias sacrificing raw truth for veiled revelation—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation intensifies credibly from observation to ritualistic action, and his internal contradiction—between passive noticing and active sanctification—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., pocketing the orris shard, returning the locket). His transformation into “quietude’s keeper” feels earned, with a visible cost: relinquishing mere observation for participatory guardianship. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion is rendered through tactile, sensory detail. The final act of placing the sanctified locket on the porch crystallizes his renunciation of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—bubbles from gills, clenched fists—and her certainty fractures believably under Thalor’s telepathic pressure. Her moral outrage shifts through three cascading revelations without epiphanic leaps, each vision altering her stance with tangible cost. The ancestor’s recontextualization avoids redemption arc clichés, preserving flawed humanity. Final resolve to “thread nuance” emerges directly from prior causality and felt loss of ancestral certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s grim optimism and “balancedly daring” nature manifest in simultaneous contradictory impulses—reckless hope versus cold calculation—embodied through tactile interactions with the dice and proofs. His motivation to capture the “texture” of a missed leap is rooted in specific, dramatized regret (the chipped die from a real-world hesitation), not abstract longing. The final choice to resume climbing after rupture is earned by prior causality: his model fails but clarifies the cost of his original inaction. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using concrete sensory detail (“wind’s kiss,” “sparks of captured regret”) to convey emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling fingers, insomnia, and “methodically hopeful” rhythm reveal a psyche shaped by trauma and yearning. His motivation (to prove kindness endures) stems credibly from backstory and intensifies through micro-choices: unrolling rice paper, painting glyphs on panes. The final drowsiness feels earned, not sentimental, as his flaw (relentless doubt) yields to witnessed reciprocity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation to rescue dying arts is consistent and embodied through tactile rituals like baking bread with initials, but her internal contradiction remains underexplored—her fear versus resolve lacks simultaneous tension. The micro-choice to shape a ‘V’ loaf shows hierarchy of values, yet emotional progression leans toward tidy resolve rather than layered irrationality. Her historically oriented trait informs action but doesn’t generate meaningful blind spots or mistakes that compound. Final endurance feels earned but borders on idealized competence without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his cursed lineage and “neatly inventive” hands, driving credible micro-choices (e.g., mirroring the yoyo string backward). His internal conflict—defiance versus fatalism—is embodied through physical decay and exhilaration. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward archetypal martyrdom without deeper psychological contradiction. The final renunciation feels earned but borders on romanticized self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—tricking Fear to escape—is compelling and rooted in her trauma, but her internal conflict lacks fully embodied contradiction during key beats. The suicide admission is powerful, yet her emotional progression leans toward articulation over visceral struggle. Micro-choices (e.g., hurling the clasp) reveal values, but some reactions feel more poetic than psychologically urgent. Her flaw (shame tied to survival) drives action credibly, though diagnostic phrasing like “unbosoming” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elowen’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is vividly embodied through action, not declaration, and intensifies under pressure. His interiority is rendered through sensory-poetic perception rather than diagnostic labels, though the lack of internal contradiction (he never doubts or falters) limits emotional complexity. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but of tension itself, yielding Earned Stasis with cost implied in exhaustion. A hairline slip: his competence borders on effortless, slightly muting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to her identity as a cartographer, with interiority rendered through tactile observation (“callused fingers,” “trained eyes”) rather than exposition. Her quiet drive manifests in micro-choices—ignoring the council, climbing the rim—that escalate logically under pressure. The final realization carries emotional weight without diagnostic self-awareness, though her internal contradiction (curiosity vs. caution) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s “emotionally rational” trait is consistently embodied—not just labeled—and shapes his micro-choices (e.g., weeping silently while cataloging evidence). His internal conflict between familial grief and scholarly duty manifests simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The grandfather backstory is concretely anchored to the present via the letter and alters his stakes without sentimentality. However, his flaw lacks genuine struggle; he never wavers or errs, reducing moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—“to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is vividly embodied through his actions and emotional contradictions, especially in the submerged pavilion sequence. His “stoically sensitive” nature drives micro-choices (e.g., wedging notes into mortar while pinned by a lintel) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“burning resolve,” “quiet fury”) that borders on label-speak, slightly distancing the reader during peak stress. The ancestral revelation of “Lira & Thorne” is earned and deepens motive without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal contradiction—logic versus intuition—is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., trusting alchemical ink in darkness). However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“dappled resolve,” “tranquilly perceptive”) that borders on label-speak without sufficient irrationality or hypocrisy under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a visible personal cost beyond shifted worldview. Still, her micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elar’s motivation—transforming grief into origami cranes—is rooted in specific, embodied memories of Lira and drives every key choice. His internal conflict between crafty control and emotional surrender manifests simultaneously in tactile actions (folding, polishing) and luminous torment. The final crane bearing his detached shadow earns the transformation through prior causality, with visible cost: the loss of his shadow as part of self. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory detail and precise micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—forged in trauma and sharpened by purpose—is consistent, embodied, and compelling. Her micro-choices (e.g., ignoring rebooting consoles to pursue the pool) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal conflict simmers beneath her focus: grief and exhilaration coexist without tidy resolution. The final act—sealing the crystal with stolen might—feels earned by her relentless drive to reclaim agency from loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered—her orphaned isolation, drone-piloting competence, and yearning for belonging feel embodied and specific. The pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” trait borders on caricature but serves thematic resonance. Both characters’ motivations intensify credibly toward the climax, and Elara’s final choice to launch another swarm feels earned by her arc from detached guardian to active seeker. However, the pilgrim lacks contradictory impulses; his role remains largely symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile actions—sifting driftwood, clutching the watch hand—and his internal conflict between deception and truth is rendered with psychological specificity. His motivation stems credibly from mirrored personal trauma (his mother’s stopped watch), and his final resolve emerges as a renunciation of his black-market trade. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; regret is “tempered” like metal, not named abstractly. His micro-choice to pocket the watch hand and later return it carries visible cost: the end of his livelihood and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, costly error—forging the drawer pull—and her arc credibly transforms deceit into reconciliation. Her internal conflict between guilt and agency manifests through embodied choices (tracing the pull, synchronized release), not abstract remorse. Kael’s parallel loss and measured response deepen relational stakes without flattening moral complexity. However, Tomas and Lira remain underdeveloped props; their presence applies pressure but lacks individualized reaction or micro-choices that would elevate secondary character impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his merrily melancholic grin, the compass shards in his palm, the taste of brine and folly—all revealing a man wrestling with regret while clinging to agency. His contradictory impulses (laughter amid despair, paddling toward redemption despite failure) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to follow his heart into the unknown—is earned through repeated micro-choices (wedging the broken compass away, navigating by poles) that align with his stated motivation. However, the emotional arc leans slightly on lyrical assertion over dramatized transformation at the climax, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jax’s motivation—reviving empathy in Elara—is compelling and rooted in guilt, but his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; regret dominates without competing impulses actively clashing in-scene. Elara’s transformation hinges on a single tear, which feels earned yet slightly abrupt given her described void-like state. The baseball functions as emotional catalyst, but Jax’s “clean slate” past occasionally slips into summary rather than embodied struggle. Still, micro-choices (descending grates, reading obits) reveal his hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—yearning for Thorne versus fear of metamorphosis—is embodied with visceral specificity (“claws forming against her will,” “fur sprouting in silken waves”). Her motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving her toward sacrifice. However, the transformation lacks a true moral or psychological struggle beyond physical discomfort; the cost feels aesthetic rather than existential. The final choice reads as inevitable, not earned through layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirien’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, blood loss, and ink-stained regrets reveal a character shaped by self-inflicted wounds and maternal urgency. Her contradictory impulses (divination vs. presence, regret vs. hope) act simultaneously, not sequentially. The final choice—to wind the clockwork into her daughter’s swaddling—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifist creed and inner turmoil are vividly embodied through concrete actions—her refusal to fight the shadow, the act of stitching—and her emotional contradictions feel earned. However, her transformation leans slightly on abstract epiphany (“joy in their shared frailty”) rather than fully dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The attribute shift (gravitational lightness) arrives without sufficient prior embodiment of its cost or mechanics. Still, her resolve remains consistent, and integration of rage into resolve is compellingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—giving light to the despairing—is embodied through concrete choices (last coin, healing herbs, bottled bugs) and culminates in an accidental yet resonant act of release. His internal contradiction (desire for transformation vs. self-erasure) pulses beneath every gesture without diagnostic label-speak. The final shift from giver to guide feels earned because his destitution is active, not passive; he orchestrates “coincidences” that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: his own anonymity and poverty. The widow’s restored sight and child’s health are consequences he neither claims nor controls, preserving moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role and values, and her “calmly inventive” trait manifests through precise actions under pressure. Interiority remains concrete—e.g., her “soft inward smile” at anomaly—not diagnostic or abstract. The cost of her rebellion is implied through risk and secrecy, though not viscerally dramatized. A minor deduction for lack of embodied emotional contradiction during high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and precognitive torment, with micro-choices (sifting star dust, placing rocks) revealing a hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction—fear of futures vs. pursuit of understanding—is embodied in tactile action, not diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of elusiveness (“no more slipping away”) feels earned through ritualized struggle. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over incremental change, softening the cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and artistic defiance, with embodied scars and micro-choices (e.g., scratching new lines on the timetable) revealing a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, favoring poetic yet concrete perception. However, the betrayal backstory feels slightly abstracted—its emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, limiting full contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to turn questions into destinations—is embodied through his mechanical arm, needle card, and fencing philosophy, creating credible internal conflict with Lang’s counter-creed. Their rivalry crystallizes into alliance via micro-choices (deciphering the sundial mid-duel), revealing a hierarchy of values: truth over victory. However, Lang’s shift feels slightly abrupt; his widened eyes aren’t enough to fully earn his surrender without deeper prior friction. Both characters remain distinct in voice and worldview, avoiding diagnostic label-speak even during philosophical barbs.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias and Mira are vividly rendered through idiosyncratic voice, embodied contradiction (“gravel and melody”), and micro-choices (sowing seeds, rebuilding shelves). Their molting selves and guarded trust feel earned, though Mira’s interiority leans slightly archetypal. The relationship functions as crucible—sorting books sparks alliance that evolves into rebellion. However, Elias’s “monthly molt” borders on diagnostic label-speak without deeper psychological friction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “steely longing” manifests in tactile choices (winding the clock, assembling a piano from scraps) and micro-decisions that reveal his hierarchy of values. His strategic creativity feels earned through consistent action, not label-only traits. However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy: grief transforms cleanly into resolve without sustained contradiction or irrationality under pressure. The final whisper of Lira risks sentimentality but is anchored by the physical act of playing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—protecting cultural memory—is vividly embodied through micro-choices (planting the seed, interpreting dreams) and internal contradiction (doubt vs. duty).
