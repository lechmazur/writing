    The protagonist's craft-specific perception (reading frost like light patterns) and adaptive trait are embodied in concrete choices. Internal contradiction appears in the decision to build the furnace rather than flee, though the motivational arc from fear to action feels somewhat linear. The "purpose in pauses" realization at the end risks epiphany language but is grounded in the glass-making metaphor. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slides toward poetic abstraction ("drifting resonance") rather than visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orren's interiority is well-embodied through his physical relationship to vibration and memory of the capsized boat. His micro-choices (arranging the forks, testing with his own memories, conducting the staff) reveal character under pressure without therapy-speak. Mara remains somewhat thin—her gestures and slate-writing are clear but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful cost at closure. The final choice ("the empty slot...had its purpose") feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through prior contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marek's undertaker identity is concretely embodied through occupation-specific choices (burial linen patches, cemetery ledgers, cataloging the dead). His "inadvertently stubborn" trait drives the key choice to follow the note despite hesitation, and the final act of wiring the lens into the receiver shows goal-directed persistence under literal pressure (bleeding ears, seam whispers). Internal contradiction appears when he acknowledges he "should have thrown it back" yet proceeds—a micro-choice that forecloses safer paths. The ending renunciation (keeping the cracked lens as proof, accepting the ledger) carries visible cost in the form of bodily harm and permanent entanglement with the drowned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Amira's interiority is embodied through the bell's "dull chime" and her mastery of "amplified quiet," and her pairing of elders with runners demonstrates character-particular problem-solving under sanctions pressure. The volunteer Sami functions primarily as a foil for exposition rather than applying independent pressure; his question about donors feels like a prompt for Amira to articulate theme. The officer confrontation and midnight-route pivot show agency under threat, but Amira's competence is nearly frictionless—she solves problems without visible internal cost or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor penalty for Sami's utility-player role and the absence of dramatized internal conflict at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's spiritual curiosity and embodied grief (the unopened-letter chest, trembling hands) anchor her motivation credibly. The camera obscura work provides concrete micro-choices, and the breath-rhythm shift at the ending forecloses her prior pattern of withholding with visible cost. However, the pilgrim functions more as a mystic facilitator than a character under pressure, and the soldier memory remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to earn the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently layered—"I had come to discover the texture of time, not merely to guide feet" shows both professional identity and conceptual hunger without label-speak. Motivation evolves from hired task to existential complicity when she realizes freeing the woman requires "let[ting] the photographs finish fading," a choice with visible cost (the dust, Lio's lost memories). Embodied contradiction appears when she traces maze lines that "pull at my fingertips, inviting me," desire and compulsion fused. Lio remains a functional secondary whose retrocognitive trap adds pressure, but his sudden vocal shift ("voice suddenly young, then suddenly absent") feels略 asserted rather than causally grounded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's agency is clean and embodied: she waits, decodes, improvises traps, and carries weight with visible cost. The chain as vow rather than trophy anchors interior contradiction, and the boy-teaching moment at the end reframes burden as grace. Minor slip: the militia's confusion feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by her trap's mechanics. Interiority is concrete and action-particular, avoiding therapy-speak even under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is embodied through synesthetic perception and tangible workshop actions; her contradictory impulses (wanting proximity to Rell to catch betrayal vs. believing invention needs a real ear) drive the device's creation. Rell's confession feels earned by the prototype's imprinting mechanism. Minor weakness: Rell's yellowish sweetness and lost sheen read slightly label-like under peak pressure, and Jory exists primarily as backstory fuel rather than a dramatized presence that changes Mara's present tactics beyond general motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lio's motivation—stealing portraits not for blackmail but to reveal "thin threads of choice"—is signaled but never dramatized as an internal contradiction under pressure. The final choice to tear the portrait in half arrives without prior micro-choices establishing his hierarchy of values; the "strange mercy" is asserted rather than embodied through competing impulses. The reader character remains a cipher whose borrowed smile and ease with the flower code are told rather than shown through differentiated voice or gesture. Nema exists only to deliver the flower-code exposition and final rearrangement, applying no direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, anchored in embodied contradiction: her theatrics "had become her way to keep grief from sealing shut," and her throat tightens remembering the faces she abandoned. The decision to leave the emergency locks engaged and her return to build transparent glass rooms both arise from consistent characterization—an impulse to weigh consequences yet choose wonder. The final quiet moment where she stops narrating and waits registers as earned stasis with visible cost. Minor penalty for the cracked bookmark's "split spine still gripping a penciled question," which reads slightly ornamental in its introduction; the question itself could be more concretely grounded in her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's agency at closure (walking in with shell, exposing Vaughn) is motivated by prior adaptive training and fear-as-compass realization. However, the transformation moment—"betrayal became transformative…because I finally saw my fear as a compass"—leans toward diagnostic epiphany without sufficient embodied cost in that beat. The boy's cast-decryption sequence shows micro-choices under pressure, but Mara's interior voice occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power") that weakens character-particular texture. Internal contradiction (fear vs. certainty) operates across beats but the final confrontation reads more declarative than contradictory in action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's obsession with mapping darkness is embodied through concrete choices—climbing the fort, consulting Lyr, describing the hush—and the progression from measuring stars to tracing silence shows internal shift. However, interiority trends abstract ("mildly obsessed hunger," "distances between terrors") rather than viscerally contradictory; the final act of drawing feels declared more than earned through prior micro-choices under immediate pressure. The transformation from light-based to silence-based navigation works causally but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    J-17's motivation is grounded in a clear philosophical quest ("to find where thoughts come from") that drives micro-choices across loops. The robot's embodied restraint—"remarkably composed," aligning broom bristles by touch—serves as both trait and constraint when it chooses mercy over further loop use. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between programmed tidiness and autonomous curiosity, visible when J-17 lifts the violin despite protocol suggesting it call Security. The final renunciation (stopping the loops to preserve the violin) is earned by the accumulated glimpses of others' thought-moments, though the answer delivered as a maintenance log ("THOUGHTS COME FROM WHAT YOU KEEP WHEN CLEANING STOPS") flirts with diagnostic label-speak; it's partially redeemed by being framed as system output rather than epiphany, but the proximity to on-the-nose thematic statement costs a half-point.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are consistently rooted in fear and complicity (hiding the lens, watching Eli), and her final gesture of transparency is earned by the accumulated weight of secrecy. Interior states remain embodied—"her own secret weight of the hidden lens pressed her tongue"—though some gestures (the doodles, the split-circle eye) border on symbolic convenience rather than fully organic discovery. Minor slip: Eli and the stagehand's motives are told more than dramatized, reducing friction at the reveal. The choice to sign her name is credible and forecloses her prior evasion with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistently grounded in his pragmatic character and layered history of deception and repair. The past fraud and secret replanting provide meaningful internal conflict that shapes his ritual with Mera. Embodied emotion appears in "his thumb ached" and "back shook," though some interiority ("an old shame in him") leans toward summary. The final choice to leave one marble and name each cultivar "like a witness" feels earned by prior causality, though the stakes could press harder on a present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's character is rendered through micro-choices under pressure: she moves from obliging compliance to active problem-solving when she recognizes the rotor threat. Her gloved warmth is embodied ("threaded with microheaters") and her stance shift from mechanic-to-caretaker is earned by the immediate stakes. Sen's motivations are clear but remain secondary, appropriate at this length. Interiority is concrete and avoids therapy-speak, though Mara's final assertion about "responsibility" edges toward stating theme rather than demonstrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to unravel Varga's code is clear and drives her through the space, but her interiority remains abstract—"inspired by silence itself" and belief in the ghost never crystallize into embodied contradiction or concrete stakes that test her commitment. The piece shows micro-choices (tapping wood, holding still) that reveal method but not hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression is muted; no visible cost forecloses a path, and the final gathering of musicians feels convenient rather than earned by prior struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—fever breaking into clean perception, the weight of a swallowed truth lodged behind the tongue—and Mara's "peripherally aware" trait drives her gentle interrogation. The final confession to Eli arrives with visible cost (loneliness, the distortion acknowledged aloud) and forecloses the narrator's isolation. Minor slip: Eli's fury upon rescue is told rather than shown, slightly flattening what should be a high-pressure reunion. Internal contradiction (guilt as false reading vs. the loneliness it created) operates convincingly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I do not believe in absolution that arrives on a hymn"), with embodied contradictions—drowsy alertness pairs skepticism with compulsive exploration. Mara's motivations are dramatized through the hidden tag and her choice to burden the narrator rather than confess directly. The final decision to call Mara, "not to forgive her, but to stop her from hiding behind my silence," is earned by prior causality and forecloses complicity with visible cost. Minor slip: the dead man's gesture ("fingers worrying a badge as if it were a rosary") edges toward stock devotional imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chronicle keeper remains passive throughout, observing without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "loose grip on reality" is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The other keeper's appearance feels ornamental rather than generating pressure through status dynamics or relationship friction. Agency is limited to witnessing, which avoids the earned change or renunciation that would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her embodied response to Mara's silence shows controlled interiority. The locket touch and final choice to share the curl demonstrate agency under pressure. However, the brother's backstory and the explanation of her "cautious exuberance" lean toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction, and the final whistle exchange feels too calibrated—a therapist performing therapy rather than a person wrestling with grief's asymmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysa is rendered through concrete particulars: tin eartrumpets, bone-handled chisel, tactile sensitivity to vibrations. Her profession shapes perception throughout ("felt vibrations as if they were sentences"), and the final choice to catalog and pin the tapestry is earned by prior action and her established role. Internal texture remains consistent, though her interior voice could show more contradiction under pressure; she proceeds methodically without much emotional friction or cost to her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lian's core motivation—to transpose life into a new key—is embodied in her shift from passive predictor to active orchestrator, and the final choice to burn the fortunes shows agency with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction is somewhat thin: the piece tells us she wants to "stop being the woman who predicted other people's minutes" but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats. Mara's interiority remains opaque, functioning more as guide than pressure source, and the courier is a prop. The prophetic gift feels more like a convenient plot device than a flaw that drives inevitable mistakes under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Selo's motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions is dramatized through deliberate choices under pressure. Mara's internal conflict surfaces through the parasite's grip loosening when memory contradicts the conquest assumption. The characterization relies heavily on abstract rhetorical concepts ("anaphora," "chiasmus," "metonymy") that function as labels rather than embodied struggle—the priest's tools feel more like authorial annotations than lived choices. The final act of drawing the circle is earned, but the middle beats lean toward summary of technique rather than visceral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and distinctive—chronological homesickness embodied through the glass-map ritual and the nautilus shell. Internal contradiction appears in wanting to conduct unheard symphonies while writing cryptic fortunes, though the link between desire and action remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to "keep writing" and "seed futures" feels more declared than earned by a visible trade-off; the homesickness dissolves without on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's interiority is consistently embodied through her gravity-defying physicality and her pattern of drifting away from commitment. The maze of self-avoidance is concrete and drives her final choice to stay in one timeline. However, the younger-self encounters feel more symbolic than dramatically earned, and the decision at the kneeling moment arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between contradictory impulses in that beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"felt vibrations thin under her boots, like breath held too long"—and her micro-choices (picking up the needle, reversing the phonograph, scoring the record) accumulate under pressure. Her deafness functions as a perceptual filter rather than a label, shaping how she reads rhythm and silence. The Listener and Kerrin remain functional but underdeveloped; Kerrin's confession of numbness arrives without prior dramatized resistance. Mara's final insight—"play the song backward if you must, but keep it moving until hearts remember forward"—feels slightly over-articulated for the moment, edging toward theme statement rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior voice is consistent and distinct—methodical, observational, grounded in the habits of storm recording. Motivation is clear throughout: nurturing integrity drives the lateral-progress escape and the data-copying choice. The decision to free Mara and release the logs carries visible cost (risk of capture, reliance on fragile pigeon delivery), and the final stance—integrity as company rather than cage—feels earned. Minor deduction: the follower remains a silhouette without internalized threat assessment that would deepen the protagonist's embodied fear.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and distinctive—"roadside poet collecting overheard prayers"—with strong perceptual signature in how they notice and filter the world through lyric observation. Motivation (discovering time's texture) drives the grotto choice and rope-mapping action. However, the ethical playfulness and pattern-making decisions feel more asserted than embodied; the narrator's interior remains more observational than contradictory under pressure. The final choice (slipknot solution) arrives smoothly but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's acoustic gift is concretely embodied ("hear a pin tremble inside a pocket") and becomes a burden under the hush, driving her choice to unbind the silence. The father's bonfire wisdom about unfinished beauty motivates her final stance, and micro-choices (lighting the tin-pan fire, pressing the bowl to the cistern) show agency under pressure. Interior contradiction appears when she laughs "without shame," suggesting prior shame now released. Minor slip: the caretaker Jory remains functional but flat, present only to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's internal contradiction between selling fakes and wanting to help is well-embodied through her actions—charging static, running fingers near sleeves, letting her own shame flow into the petal. The professional detachment versus emerging empathy drives her choices at the closure when she takes payment "as a boundary" yet writes the brother's name on the case. Minor slip: Orin's touching his chest "as if checking a cracked compass" edges toward convenient metaphor rather than earned character detail, and his emotional arc—from numbness to tears—resolves cleanly without the messier irrationality that high-pressure grief typically carries.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clearly rooted in her mother's history and sustained through micro-choices (waiting after the concert, taking the longer route, proposing the envelope system). Interior experience is embodied through specific action rather than label-speak. However, Eli's emotional arc feels compressed—his embarrassment and agreement arrive too easily without meaningful internal contradiction, and the secondary characters (tuner, janitor, longshoreman) serve purely functional roles without pressure or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sava's interiority is rendered through concrete choices—offering to join the search, asking to be taught kinship, weaving the arbor—but her interior contradictions remain muted. The phrase "ache of being unclaimed" verges on label-only sentiment; embodied emotion is stronger when she "soaked them in crater mist" and physically grafted the lattice. Secondary characters (Oren, Ilya, the council) apply pressure but function more as witnesses than agents with their own stakes. The final choice to dedicate the arbor is earned causally, though the cost (social vulnerability, permanent commitment) is implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rin's motivation is clear and embodied through her sketching habit and pendant-warming detail. Interior contradiction appears in the tension between wanting to pin down echoes while seeking "the place where echoes are born," but the final choice—deliberately breaking the cadence to open the cage—feels somewhat inevitable rather than a foregrounded dilemma with visible cost. The protagonist's competence (borrowing time, navigating the throat chamber) proceeds smoothly without meaningful struggle or degradation under stress. Orren and the echo-figure remain functional pressure points but lack distinct voices or behavioral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's motivation is consistently rooted in grief and her systematic, inventive personality. Her micro-choices under pressure—kneeling, adjusting the glass eyes, choosing to speak rather than run—embody contradictory impulses (tenderness and fury, longing and analytical restraint). The final choice to build a spellwork bridge and accept Orren as "reachable, though not retrievable" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of forced resolution with visible emotional cost. Minor weakness: some interiority leans toward abstraction ("a number between integers") rather than fully embodied perception, but it remains character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation to become visible is concrete and embodied through his caching system, but his interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The child's palm-to-tin moment offers embodied emotion, yet Lio's own transformation—"he began, at last, to feel seen"—reads as summary rather than enacted cost. The relationship between Lio and the child is one-directional observation; no on-page friction tests his commitment. Micro-choices are present (placing the note, watching through the vent) but lack visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("circuitously sincere, arriving by side roads of jokes and questions"), and her contradictory impulses—wanting intimacy "in theory but not in skin"—act simultaneously on the page. The metamorphosis is earned through prior causality (touching the leaf, resisting, then releasing control), with visible cost (darkened nails, altered senses). Minor slip: the boy's nod "as if he understood more than she did" edges toward convenience, but the rest of the characterization is embodied and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("wryly earnest habit of taking notes on everything"), with embodied emotion (shaking hands, salt in lungs). The final choice to exchange one brooch with Mara is earned through prior causality—the narrator's need to paint something beyond ruins drives the search, and the convergence device allows access to memory. Minor weakness: the sister's face appearing in the tubes feels convenient rather than earned by on-page struggle, reducing the cost visibility slightly. Internal contradiction is present (skepticism vs. porousness to belief) and drives authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lan and Sera are differentiated through distinct wants (his unreliable visions vs. her wish for everyday magic), and the inhabitation forces Lan into internal conflict with embodied cost. However, the motivations rely heavily on told backstory rather than on-page micro-choices under pressure; Lan's fight against the force is summarized ("Lan fought inside himself") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to sing feels more thematic than earned by prior causal beats, and the force's softening arrives without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is consistently rendered through her archival lens—she sees absence as navigable reefs, turns the valve to understand silence as record. Her micro-choices (spacing Sorrel's visits, copying missing page numbers, orchestrating three evenings to cool anger) demonstrate a coherent methodology under pressure. The characterization of secondary figures (Sorrel, Ilven) remains functional but thin; their transformation is told more than embodied. Minor deduction for the boy's question feeling like a convenient prompt for Mara's thematic articulation rather than organic resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is specific and embodied—the phantom punch clicking at lies, her method of tracking cracks—and her confession about drinking is earned by the causal chain. However, interiority occasionally drifts into label-only phrasing ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic habit") without dramatized cost in the moment. The conductor and janitor remain functional props rather than pressuring presences. The final choice to begin mapping feels like continuation rather than a foreclosed path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior emerges through concrete micro-choices—volunteering despite skepticism, agreeing to sit with Jory, offering the logbook to Leena—and her "sympathetic skeptic" stance is embodied in action rather than declared. The closing realization ("not convinced of miracles yet certain of meaning") earns its weight through accumulated pressure. Minor slip: Jory and Leena's interiorities occasionally blend with Mara's perceptual filter without clear dramatized cues, and the phrase "courageously kind" reads as authorial labeling rather than discovered trait.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilias's interiority is concrete and character-particular: boredom as "cowardice, an endless refusal to risk losing himself" carries embodied weight. His micro-choices (pressing the amulet, stepping through the slit) arise from contradictory impulses—curiosity versus self-preservation—and the final renunciation forecloses immortality with visible cost. Maris's confession and her pale knuckles anchor emotion physically. Minor slip: "intrigue was the only emotion he could still manufacture on demand" edges toward diagnostic label-speak but remains within the immortal's weary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's characterization is strong: her interior ledger of truth and safety creates contradiction that drives choices under pressure. The shift from hiding Mercy to using it to write Sami's real story shows agency with cost—defying Ivo's con by choosing honest documentation. Sami's embodied fear ("pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence") and specific detail (published proofs, torn passport) ground his stakes. Minor: Ivo remains somewhat stock, his "practiced grin" and magician gestures leaning toward archetype, though his late deflation—"smaller"—earns the trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Haru's interiority is concrete and particularized—his desire to "collect the textures of different times" drives micro-choices (carrying the notepad to the garden, placing gilded slips at crossings). The transition from fluorescent-lamp charting to bonsai-labyrinth work shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the final choice ("wrote a final history in which the people returned quietly") feels more declared than dramatized; the embodied cost of renunciation or endurance is implied but not viscerally felt on the page. No emotional label-speak mars the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's synesthesia (sound as touch) is embodied consistently and drives micro-choices: they keep their voice low, hunger for texture over facts, layer stories in memory rather than on paper. The final choice to whisper rescued names and accept namelessness as a vessel shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between erasure-fear and erasure-acceptance, though the arc could press harder on competing impulses in peak beats. Minor slip: the discovery of Container 9H feels more revelatory than agonizing, slightly muting the emotional cost at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's "myth buster" stance and "gloomy cheerfulness" show consistent voice, and his progression from chasing hoaxes to "hearing honest gaps" traces a clear arc. However, the interiority often borders on thesis-statement ("The answer is the gap you keep refusing to hear"), and key choices—setting the shell in the cello, retelling memories—feel more symbolic than earned by prior contradiction or struggle. The final insight lacks the concrete cost or foreclosed path that would anchor the change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal pressure, embodied in her night-and-day actions, but her transformation feels linear rather than contradictory—she moves smoothly from Council employee to resistance leader without visible cost until the very end. The foundation stone chip moment with Majo provides external motivation more than internal struggle. Administrator Vell's sudden capitulation ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum he could not run") arrives without prior cues that he valued carnival authenticity over profit, undercutting the earned-change test. Micro-choices are present but lack the self-deception or hypocrisy that would deepen her orderly-intuitive trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her "curiosity like a tool, sharpened on purpose" and the choice to use chemistry over radio show character-specific logic. The relationship with Eli operates as crucible; his question about trusting chemistry and her response reveal her values, and their shared dawn vigil at the end carries visible cost (the erasure of the old sky). Minor: the emotional progression is clean but lacks one more layer of contradictory impulse under pressure; her melancholy reads singular rather than conflicted. The final choice to photograph and preserve the grain is motivated and forecloses a path (pure documentation vs. shared witness), meeting the closure test.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's characterization is embodied through his sensory methodology—listening to tools, feeling warmth shifts on knuckles, counting sizzles—and his calm authority emerges through action rather than assertion. His blindness functions as a genuine constraint that shapes his repair technique rather than a label. The courier and Captain Sera remain functional but thinly sketched; they apply pressure without interior contradiction. Lio's final instruction to Sera ("treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering") carries thematic weight but stops short of a visible internal cost or renunciation that would elevate the arc into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Riven's voice is distinct and embodied—"I said it like an editor, tasting the implication"—with subtly confident micro-choices throughout (packing before dawn, aligning the atlas beneath the pane). Lysa functions cleanly as a calm counterpoint without clutter. The final choice to simply listen rather than immediately report feels earned by the accumulation of prior caution and the weight of what discovery means, though the cost remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sava's motivation is clear—restore balance through sound—and his methods (patient walking, tuning fork, footstep rhythms) are specific and consistent. The character remains cryptic by design, but his interior contradiction is thin: he never doubts, never faces a genuine cost that forecloses a path. Mara's arc from watcher to participant adds mild pressure, but her choice to join reads convenient rather than conflicted. The ending grants success without visible sacrifice; Sava tucks away the fork and watches, having won without bleeding beyond his soles.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and evolves under pressure: instinct screams to flee, but she overrides it twice with visible micro-choices that foreclose escape. Her embodied stress ("air hissed thin," "panic rose again") is specific, and the final choice to share memory via the mirror feels earned by her mother's teaching about ephemeral art. Internal contradiction operates in scene—fear vs. curiosity, survival vs. salvage—and the renunciation of easy escape carries palpable cost. Minor: the wire-knot moment could show more tactical fumbling to deepen struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—chasing hush to finish his father's story—and the internal contradiction between wanting eyes away while also needing to name the dead creates genuine tension. The hovering ability is embodied through listening until "my weight forgot itself," avoiding magical convenience. The choice to leave the door ajar and whisper into the lattice demonstrates agency with visible cost (accepting disbelief), though the emotional progression through the discovery could be more contradictory and less controlled. Minor deduction for the slightly too-articulate self-awareness in "I wanted eyes away, a space where the dead could be named without spectacle."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's motivation to repay the bride is clear and drives his final choice to give up the bead and match his heartbeat to its rhythm. Interior work is vivid—"joy and grief braided together until my chest hurt with a kind of mournful elation"—and the embodied cost of returning the bead is felt. However, the backstory of the marriage abandonment arrives through told exposition ("my hands in another life, sealing a marriage charm…and then abandoning her") rather than dramatized memory, weakening the felt urgency of the debt. The ending renunciation is earned, but the stakes feel abstract because we never see Eli wrestle with the trade-off on the page before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ila's motivation is present and her "haunting optimism" is embodied through her brother's return and the choice to use thread-as-guidance, but key decisions feel more described than enacted under pressure. The sleepwalking method distances agency; when the smuggler apologizes "he could not explain," we lose the contradictory impulse acting in scene. The final choice—sewing nets across gaps—arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. Internal conflict is gestured at ("grief without denying it") but not dramatized in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation is grounded in concrete backstory (interrupted journeys, dead mother) and embodied through purposeful wandering that becomes method. Internal contradiction appears in "faith had been depending on arrival, not on direction"—a genuine realization that shifts her stance. The final choice to stay and "keep rebuilding" feels earned by her underground work and the notebook's lesson. Minor issue: Father Sava and the buried pilgrim remain functional props rather than sources of dynamic pressure, though this doesn't compromise Liora's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's profession as pseudonym creator is established with concrete detail (ebony clipboard, chalk codes), and the interior sensory register is specific and controlled. However, the decisive final action—creating "M. Return" and setting the trap—lacks visible internal conflict or cost; the choice feels more procedural than personally consequential. Emotional progression is understated to the point of flatness during the discovery of intercepted letters, where visceral fear or moral stakes would sharpen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's disguise strategy ("wisdom disguised as foolishness") is established but her internal contradiction remains static—she reads as consistently clever throughout without genuine vulnerability or misstep. Her choices are purposeful (stitching errors, nudging the orrery) but the embodied stakes feel muted; we're told she's at risk yet her affect is calm competence. Master Kest applies pressure but remains functional; his danger to her or hers to him never sharpens. The ending forecloses the path to silence (she sends the chart), but the cost—social, physical, or relational—is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior contradiction—wanting to reach the pre-decision moment rather than rewrite the past—is embodied through her physical choices (carrying the shard, tearing letters, staying three nights). The brother Elias arrives drawn by "rumors" and "the ache of all the messages he never received," yet his emotional state remains under-rendered; we see him only as "older, wary." The apology at closure feels earned by the three-night vigil, but Mara's internal texture leans toward diagnostic clarity ("tired of decisions made in loneliness") rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene, and the final beat summarizes the apology rather than letting us hear its specific words.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lani's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven; her translation work embodies her trauma response through the coral fragment and cast-reading. Mako's "shrewdly innocent" smile and the secondary characters (captain, liaison) apply clear pressure. The ending choice—grafting new meaning—is earned by prior causality, though the final beat leans slightly toward articulation rather than remaining fully embodied under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is vividly rendered through her way of noticing ("fog took on faint shadows") and her profession anchors her embodied knowledge. The motivation to rediscover joy is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in action; the closing choice to "display the lamp and fragment…inviting anyone to join her network" reads as conceptual wish-fulfillment rather than a trade-off with visible personal cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("pensive mirth," "recessive laughter") that feels imposed rather than lived. Her journey lands as observation and re-framing rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life shows purpose—"exchanging certainty for curiosity"—and her micro-choices (listening instead of answering, tapping the nickel four times) reveal a hierarchy of values. The nested awakenings, however, blur motivation: each loop resets agency rather than compounding it, so the final "I do not know yet" feels more like label than earned renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in the held breath and quiet laugh, but the recursive structure dilutes the felt cost of choosing uncertainty. The trait "methodically playful" is named but not dramatized as a constraint that forces a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied choices under pressure (leading auditors into the butterfly room). Lio's characterization suffers from charm-label reliance and perceptual flatness—his smile "as if the world were a prank" tells rather than dramatizes his roguishness. The greenhouse refuge motivation is clear, but the narrator's arc lacks visible internal contradiction; compliance with Lio's plan proceeds without dramatized hesitation beyond "When I hesitated." Secondary characters (retirees, students) apply immediate pressure but remain undifferentiated.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular: her sleeplessness, the notebook pressed damp against her ribs, the inherited duty that makes her "shyly unstoppable." The descent to the Heart-Cistern shows embodied stakes—"fingers shook with all the nights she had not slept"—and her final refusal to claim credit is earned by established modesty. Minimal internal contradiction or visible flaw; she is competent and dutiful without struggle that complicates the choice. The elders and captains' grandchildren remain functional pressures rather than developed characters, fitting the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The caretaker's interior voice is consistent and concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like "foxglove regret blooming in my throat." The decision to cross the museum and repair the chime arises from established motive (preserving names), and the final stance—continuing rounds with gratitude replacing regret—reads as earned. However, the protagonist faces no genuine internal contradiction or difficult trade-off; the journey is systematic problem-solving without competing impulses, and the micro-choices (counting steps, breathing in fours) illustrate routine rather than reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to restore trust after hiding the codex is clear and drives the ritual setup. However, her interior life relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("promises had started to sound like paper in a fire") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The team members remain undifferentiated gestures—"careful distance of scholars who once were friends"—without distinct speech or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Ilyon's confession at the climax introduces a new betrayal (his silent test) that feels more like plot convenience than earned character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal conflict between factions is embodied through her trembling hands and the measured chain work, showing contradictory impulses (hope vs. professional duty) acting simultaneously. The father's chain carries biographical weight that shapes her values without therapy-speak. Rolen's confession and the shared measurement at closure earn the shift from rivals to collaborators. Minor slip: the council's demand for "loyalty to property" and keepers' "loyalty to water songs" edge toward thesis-speak but remain grounded in concrete gate settings.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is richly textured through embodied details (balance beam practice, dust-mote reading method), and her motivations are layered across trust issues and preservation of her mother's songs. The final choice to send the birds demonstrates contradictory impulses in action—risk versus safety, trust versus betrayal—earned by prior material. However, Merek and Oren remain functional rather than fully individuated; their interiority is told more than shown, and the climactic confession scene lacks embodied emotional specificity. The meteorite-chip shadow moment reads slightly symbolic rather than anchored in visceral decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is rooted in her father's disappearance and her inheritance of his maze-philosophy, but her interior life reads more as thematic musing than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices (waiting, counting breaths, measuring the gap) are present but lack visible cost or competing impulses that would elevate them. "Featherly determined" appears twice as a phrase rather than showing up as a trait that constrains action with trade-offs. The final crossing and door-building feel more like thematic resolution than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("landscape astrologer" anchors a distinct perceptual signature), and her micro-choices—tapping walls, using the hairpin—feel purposeful under pressure. Jonah's confession ("counting days like bolts") embodies loneliness concretely. The final shift from solitary wandering to shared map-making earns Mira's sense of belonging with visible emotional cost, though the arc feels slightly accelerated in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is textured and concrete ("crater glass warmed in my palm"), and micro-choices—following seeds, placing glass against Mira's pulse—reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, Mira's transformation from grief to healing feels rushed; her spoken apology resolves the broken promise with minimal internal conflict or embodied cost. The narrator remains an observer through most of the closure beat, reducing agency at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo's characterization is concrete and consistent: his analytical nature drives his orchestrated serendipity method, and his micro-choices—sanding the board, using the bishop as wedge—reveal hierarchical values under pressure. The rescue sequence shows genuine problem-solving under stress with visible tradeoffs (abandoning his planned comic act). Internal voice remains distinct throughout, though the "lightly attentive" trait functions more as atmospheric description than embodied contradiction. The night watch's trajectory from skeptical to engaged is economically rendered, and the boy's mother's panic reads authentic without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is vivid and her dancer's perceptual signature (reading currents with ankles, noticing gaps) distinguishes her viewpoint. The anchoring sequence shows embodied reaction—panic flaring, then dancer sense noticing rhythm—and her choice to keep the speck rather than gain release demonstrates contradictory impulses in scene. However, the motivation remains largely contemplative; her final turn toward "other banned gardens" reads as resolved intent rather than a choice under competing pressure, and the embodied cost of staying anchored dissolves too neatly when the keeper releases her.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilya's interiority is specific and embodied through his glazier's craft, with the stone-throwing method revealing his thought process. His motivation to preserve the atrium is consistent and drives the inspector encounter, though the inspector's pivot from demolition advocate to champion feels rapid given the established bureaucratic appetite. The micro-choices (placing plain glass, throwing the stone, explaining the ripple patterns) reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction is present in his night-time doubt versus dawn-time confidence, but the inspector's sudden shift undermines the earned quality of Ilya's persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core choice—to confess the false report—emerges from reflection rather than dramatic pressure in scene, weakening motivation at closure. Her interiority leans toward articulate self-diagnosis ("scars, she knew, were stories that refused to be private") rather than embodied contradiction under fire. Jonah's arc from freeze to resolve reads schematic; his fear is told more than shown through micro-choices that test commitment. The backstory with Eli is vivid but occupies significant real estate without on-page friction that would charge Mara's present decision.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mina's "logical dreamer" nature is embodied through concrete actions—repairing calibration formulas, encoding patterns in prime numbers—and her motivation to puzzle out hope drives micro-choices throughout. Interiority is specific and grounded in her methodical approach, though emotional embodiment occasionally slips toward conceptual label ("serene upheaval" as descriptor rather than sensation). The ensemble-across-timelines realization provides genuine internal complexity, and her climb to town with the gauge represents agency with cost (leaving solitary experimentation for communal risk). Minor voice convergence in the town-gathering sequence slightly flattens her distinct perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation is concrete and embodied through her cartography work, though her interior life leans toward abstract philosophical musings ("what walls dream about") more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision at the end—to submit a false map and preserve the chamber's privacy—is earned by the diary revelations and her mother's voice, but the choice unfolds through summary rather than a dramatized micro-choice with visible hesitation or cost on the page. Arlen functions well as an off-page architect whose legacy pressures Liora, and the final promise to the corridors closes with credible endurance, though the emotional progression from discovery to deception could show more internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The borrowed heartbeat creates a concrete interior pressure and the protagonist's final choice—returning it to the boy—carries visible cost. However, interiority leans toward lyric abstraction ("panic could not fit inside the odd loan") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The painter remains more atmospheric presence than character with agency, and the sister exists entirely off-page, limiting relational crucible work. Motivation is clear but the peak choice feels more thematic than viscerally earned through prior micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sera's interiority shows layered contradictions—"operatively gentle" yet haunted by the doomed corridor, patience disciplined into ritual yet carrying unhealed guilt. The final move (burning her own map) forecloses redemption-as-absolution and crystallizes a choice to pay daily labor instead. Minor slip: the girl and some envoys remain gestural; their micro-choices don't complicate Sera's arc. Motivation is clear and embodied through the scars, the clipboard weight, and the ritual design.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inez is strongly characterized through contradictory impulses: the engineer of manufactured drought who carries an extinct bird's egg with throat-tightening sentiment. Her internal contradiction drives the final choice to shatter the egg, embodying both the grace she broke and the grace she still chooses. The philanthropy-as-arithmetic metaphor is concretely anchored in her actions (ordering droughts, building clinics), and the final renunciation feels earned. Minor: some interiority edges toward diagnostic phrasing ("the wrong kind of tenderness"), though it remains within voice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is motivated by her sister's coerced pledge and acts with clear agency—unlocking the sanctuary through patience and bodily poem. Her interiority is specific ("alarming serenity was her shield") and embodied gestures reveal character under pressure (the hidden knot, the bow as new grammar). Internal contradiction appears in her performance of compliance while defying it, though the final renunciation could carry sharper visible cost. The governor remains functional pressure but one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilya's interiority demonstrates internal conflict between artistic ambition and ethical boundaries, and his micro-choices (walking out, carving questions onto the stick, offering it to Mara) reveal values under pressure. The arc from "uncommonly serene" detachment to "serenity...earned" shows alteration with cost, though the epiphany feels somewhat delivered rather than discovered through visceral struggle. Mara remains a prompt-figure whose resistance is told more than dramatized through her own contradictory impulses. The contract-on-napkin beat reads slightly too tidy as closure, though the cost of forfeiting absolute creative control is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin's interiority is consistently embodied through his building rituals and notebook care; the knot-tying as promise shows character-particular thought. His motivations (measuring omens through what they save, honoring forgotten technicians) drive concrete on-page choices. The voice breaks once during the reading of names—a moment of genuine emotional weight—but the final choice to dismantle and memorialize feels earned. Minor deduction: the esoteric-realist self-definition reads slightly like a label rather than emerging fully through dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is specific and grounded in craft: misreading metal, listening for fiber creak, pricking wax with holes. The guilt over erased names is concretely embodied in "an ingot in my chest" and the final choice to cast a durable transcript is motivated by prior particulars. The arc from carrying the mistake to mending it through exact technical work is earned, though the emotional progression is somewhat smooth—no contradictory impulses complicate the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's internal contradictions are present ("I see the next step and the last one, but never the whole map") and the motivation to be "worthy of being chosen" emerges clearly. However, the interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("Do you think you choose, or are you chosen by the choosing?") rather than embodied crisis choices under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting that "the walking walks you"—feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. The ash woman and dream sequences function more as symbolic guides than sources of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nabu-iddin's frugality and grief anchor his actions with clear motivation, and his empirical skepticism creates productive contradiction when he snaps his trusted stylus to seal a covenant with the unknown—an earned choice with visible cost. Interior states are embodied (eating "thin barley cakes," wrapping the tile in linen from a discarded curtain) rather than labeled. The astronomer's professional lens filters every perception, and his final peace reads as earned stasis with conceptual weight. Minor: the mason and the "unnamed presence" remain abstractions; more friction in the decision to sacrifice certainty would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority shows purpose-driven thought ("scheme was to restore the melody") but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. Mara's shift from knife-carrier to release feels insufficiently earned; her resistance is declared ("face hardened") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The cellular-memory mechanism replaces psychological specificity with a concept-label that circumvents the need for individuated internal conflict. Minor: "childhood that the shifting city had stolen" reads as convenient backstory rather than a lived constraint shaping present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio's internal contradiction between grounded artisan and dream-chaser drives sustained pressure. The synchronized breathing method embodies his struggle without label-speak, and the final choice to "invite" rather than "trap" the dream shows earned insight. Minor: his expertise appears convenient (instant mastery of brass-casting, mirror-fitting) without struggle, and the "second heart" warmth reads slightly sentimental. The cost—carrying a window "where no wall could hold"—lands with ambiguity but feels conceptually earned.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to return the ribbon and her pride in strictness facing the guild's betrayal supply internal contradiction. Her improvisational repair earns the ending choice, though the boy's scowl-to-surprise beat is lightly sketched. The canon's grandson and sister remain functional but occupy more stage space than their pressure justifies, and the sister's vow-reversal feels convenient rather than inevitable. Embodied emotion appears ("stung," "laughed despite herself"), but several beats rely on summary tags rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is present but remains abstract—she "inquires" of the cameo, "suspects" nonlinear inheritance, and "realizes" the trap without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final acceptance ("accepting that the simplest way…") reads as epiphany declared rather than earned through scene-level agency; no visible foreclosure of a live option with felt cost. Motivation is conceptually coherent but lacks the sensory particularity and internal friction that would anchor her stakes in the body and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's motives (rescuing trapped readers, honoring her grandmother's quest) are clear and her "carefully resourceful" trait shows in selective tool use and negotiation tactics. Her choice to renegotiate rather than pay in memories demonstrates character-driven agency. However, interiority remains thin—emotional stakes are declared ("the diary...hummed like a missing note") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final act of "offering a correction" resolves smoothly without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a credible alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal landscape shows texture—"unkindled solace, warm only in imagination" and the drive to collect stories as tickets. However, her twin Lio exists primarily as a memory-construct; his "braver half" label remains asserted rather than enacted in their shared past. The climactic choice to pin the emerald fabric and speak the final line feels more ritual than renunciation, lacking visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Embodiment is intermittent: she kneels and pins, but the cost of trading "certainty" for Lio's return never materializes as a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's professional identity is vividly embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, tracing the seal, speaking aloud, methodically unweaving), and her motivations drive each beat. Interior access is consistent and her "warmly methodical" approach creates a credible perceptual signature. The stakes are clear and the final act of filing under dual categories with a public reading demonstrates earned agency. However, the faceless diplomat figure remains abstract, and Mara's emotional response to the revelation (anger, then purpose) feels slightly summarized rather than embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sava's motivation is consistent and her sensory/perceptual signature (ripple-marks, harmonic awareness) remains distinct throughout. The choice to place the echo chamber stone and conjure the bloom of hush demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The resolution feels more like competent problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The custodian's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—touching objects, climbing stairs, fitting prism pieces—and the retrocognitive gift creates genuine interior contradiction (seeing futures as "echoes of choices" complicates agency). The obsession to prove meaning drives escalating micro-choices with visible cost: risking the climb, trusting the shard's pull, answering strangers. Minor slip: the caravan leader's quoted wisdom in the retrocognitive flash borders on thematic ventriloquism, slightly over-articulating the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation to preserve collective memory is coherent and intensifies when they decide to write their own memories into the crystal. The choice to offer their personal history as a "spine" for the Archive emerges from established pressure and carries visible cost—the risk of losing personal contour. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("preemptively nostalgic," "identity shift") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final move feels earned but the path there relies more on conceptual assertion than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jorin's choices drive key beats (agreeing to the show, reading the hidden message, repositioning the fireworks), but his interiority remains thin—chanting and "ambient awareness" are asserted more than embodied with contradictory impulses. The castellan and the child remain functional roles rather than pressure-sources with their own stakes. Emotional stakes (defying hopelessness) are declared but never tested by a visible internal conflict that forces Jorin to choose between competing goods with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motives are layered—surface conflict with Iven, deeper desire to map time's texture—and her micro-choices (touching the cicada, deflecting his demand with memory) show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is strong: Iven's thumb worrying the cloak seam, Mara's hand warming the cicada. The final choice to propose moving north rather than reveal her hidden copies feels earned, though the renunciation's cost could land harder on the page. Internal voice is concrete and character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinctive—fear of enclosure rendered through bodily compression ("chest tightened," "ribs"), and the father's teaching method (three breaths closed, one open) creates visible micro-choices that track internal progression. The final choice to open the gilded hush jar earns the shift from claustrophobia to expansion through accumulated exposure work on the trellis. Minor slip: the father's motivations are told more than shown in embodied conflict ("he wanted me to taste the difference"), relying on summary over dramatized pressure between them.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is consistently motivated by his mother's legacy and teaching silence how to comfort; his decision to show the meter and slow the gondola are micro-choices under pressure. Mara's grief is embodied through swollen eyes and map-twisting, and her shift to counting creaks shows earned traction. The interiority leans slightly elevated ("fluidly logical as the terrace's shifting colored panes") but remains character-particular. No unmotivated leaps; the final stance is earned by the cable-creak pedagogy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ione's motivations are clear—lore keeper curiosity with a childlike hope—and the choice at the throne to bring witnesses rather than claim power feels earned. However, the internal contradiction between "adventurous" and "cautious with facts" is stated but never dramatized in a difficult choice where these impulses collide. The refusal to take the crown reads as predetermined virtue rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost; we never see her tempted or struggling. Embodiment is present in moments like the ruby warming in her palm, but peak emotional beats rely on summary ("her adventure had never been about owning") rather than enacted conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal contradiction—burning bridges as ritual yet responding to Lio's shadow—is embodied through her physical interaction with scars and threshold, not merely asserted. The trait "burns bridges carefully" is demonstrated through concrete action (letting phone go dark, tracing scars) but the peak choice to help Lio feels slightly under-motivated given the established pattern of severance; the shift from isolation to connection needs one more micro-choice showing internal friction. Emotions are mostly embodied (breath as "thin, mean thread," panic in wood grain) though "loaded emptiness" flirts with label-only phrasing. The final acceptance that "some contact must be cut so that others can breathe" earns the stance shift but could use sharper internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation (shame → redemption → collective action) is clear and her agency drives the drum sequence, but interiority remains abstract—"ache of those parallel selves like pressure she could finally use" tells rather than embodies. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is label-only; we never see her mis-direct or prank with on-page cost during a choice beat. Internal contradiction is absent: she moves from guilt to generosity in a smooth arc without simultaneous competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leander's motivation is concretely tied to historical restitution and his renunciation is earned through the discovery. His "eloquently silent" trait operates consistently, shaping his method of influence without speech. Internal contradiction appears briefly in his scholar's hunger versus dynastic duty, though more friction would strengthen the middle beats. Embodied emotion remains somewhat muted; the key climax relies on presentation rather than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calven's motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" remains abstract and under-dramatized; the internal contradiction between his withdrawn nature and his decisive unsnapping feels insufficiently earned. The emotional progression—from shaking heart to "shivering bliss" to "calm resolve"—reads as a sequence of declared states rather than embodied struggle. The marionette's murmur in his "long dead captain's" cadence offers a micro-choice moment, but the leap to full commitment lacks visible friction or cost that would ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's widowhood and grief function as embodied motivation that shapes her archival method—reading "what people did not write"—and her choice to draft a careful note rather than overwhelming Josie. The motives feel earned and her micro-choices (cutting twine, copying the letter in her neat hand) carry visible weight. However, interiority occasionally tips toward label-speak: "her grief shift from a weight into a lens" and "her own heart, not healed, but moving" read as therapeutic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Minor embodiment gaps prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—she trades favors, copies seals, and pursues revision records—and her resourcefulness is shown through micro-choices under pressure. However, interiority relies on elevated diction ("door in her chest opening," "erasure feel normal") that flattens embodied emotion during peak beats. The courier rescue earns a modest change, but the final choice reads as competent execution rather than a decision with contradictory impulses visibly at war. Internal conflict is asserted more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's motivation is clear and embodied through the vest ritual and his physical relationship with sound. His internal conflict between preserving his mother's voice and protecting the town drives the arc. The micro-choices—pacing the octagon, choosing whisper over melody—reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: the transition from "frightened by the warning" to decisive action could be more granular, but the mother's teaching anchors his capability.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation is grounded in a specific professional practice (seed sorting) and anchored by embodied micro-choices—prodding, building cairns, scraping dust—that reflect his patient worldview. His decision to open the vault and bring the book public is causally linked to the monuments and moonstone-dust-marked prodding, though the interior texture relies heavily on thematic labels ("shy mossy delight," "hope") that soften the particularity. The transformation from orderly sorter to public truth-bearer is staged but the moment of risking exile or reprisal is elided, reducing the felt cost of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is seeded early ("to befriend uncertainty in planning") and her choices—taking the map, searching the conservatory, offering the bargain—track consistently. However, the internal contradiction promised by "uncertainly certain" remains more label than embodied struggle; her decisions feel methodical rather than torn. The admiral and Corin serve functional pressure roles but lack distinct voice or embodied tension. Emotional progression is muted; no moment forces a trade-off between contradictory impulses with visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the craft mechanics—dripping her own name into the crucible to find Orin costs her childhood, and returning stolen names makes her tongue "honest and raw." Internal contradiction appears when her heart wants resurrection but her craft denies it, forcing the smaller redemption. The final choice to lighten her name "by one lie" and bring Orin home with his true name intact is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of shortcuts. Minor deduction: Ellis's agency is summarized rather than dramatized in the culvert scene, and the transition from showing him the coin to his sobbing confession feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is richly embodied—crocodile tooth rubbed smooth, chest burning—and her contradictory impulses (compassion vs. old guilt in her wrists) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to recite the frog rhyme is earned by her own plague-era loss, and Elowen's shift from frozen rocking to unwilling laughter feels causally rooted. Minor slip: Elowen's confession structure ("I counted contractions… I wanted to run") tilts toward therapeutic articulation rather than messy breakdown, softening the peak slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement is handled with specificity ("every joint reports its angle like a confession"), and the body-memory mechanics create embodied trauma responses. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor rather than lived contradiction—the narrator articulates their condition with clinical precision that feels more authorial than crisis-driven. The final choice to "start back toward dawn with a map in my skin" reads as earned renunciation with cost, but the path there relies on exposition about mercy's mathematics rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to preserve overlooked histories is present but largely asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Interior work leans on elevated abstractions ("elusively tangible like mist," "intuition needs anchors") that feel more poetic than character-specific. The final act of translating names has earned set-up, but the journey lacks visible internal friction—the protagonist moves smoothly from intention to execution without meaningful cost dramatized on the page. Reflection dominates the texture, anchored to present stimuli (the lens, the paintings), yet micro-choices that alter tactics remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular—"the living lie with words, but dust never does"—with embodied observation driving micro-choices (kneeling to trace patterns, climbing the counter). Internal contradiction appears when responsibility is claimed as "weightless burden," a paradox that's felt rather than resolved. The ghosts function as pressure rather than mere atmosphere, and the choice to "engage" leads to the action of carrying out the barrel, a renunciation of evidence-taking that forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor slip: the barrel "warmed in my pocket like a small heart" risks sentimentality, but the prior particulars earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation is consistent—distrusting perfection yet maintaining it—and his final choice to rupture the catalog is earned by the spiral frost and Mara's whisper. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: he likes the system yet knows it hides a seam. The embodiment is strong (uncorking the vial, aligning whisper with frost), but the climactic lever-pull lacks visceral embodied tension or micro-hesitation that would elevate the cost. Mara remains abstract; her presence charges the stakes but her shape never resolves into contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Len's motivation is clearly established—he clings to the Diggers' dream to reimagine civilization beyond slogans—and the peak confession to Yara deepens his internal contradiction between his defunct revolutionary past and present curatorial impulse. Yara's backstory (lost sister to Len's revolution) adds relational friction and her desire for restoration versus his reimagining creates on-page tension. However, the final choice (devising a third act exhibition) feels more narrated than dramatized; the decision is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. The renunciation of both Academy claim and Diggers' weapon is legible but arrives through summary rather than an embodied micro-choice with visible hesitation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ivo's motivation is clear and his professional identity shapes his perception, but interiority leans toward declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The Midnight Thief's confession ("a hollow it could not name") provides a key turn, yet the resolution feels too cleanly calibrated—no messy hesitation or competing impulse complicates the mending choice. Micro-choices are present (raising the chip, using the wire as a bow) but lack visible cost or internal friction that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is distinctive and embodied—her psychometry readings are rendered as sensory floods rather than explained powers, and her choices show agency (pockets the compass, pours petrichor as offering). Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous pragmatism (pays bills on time) and hunger for the unmeasured, driving her delve. The final renunciation (leaving the compass, pouring the jar) feels earned by the prior visions and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the expedition leader's murmured insight in the second psychometry reading edges toward convenient wisdom-delivery rather than Mara's own synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's spiral-making is concretely motivated through her sculptor identity and responds to the lantern's prompt with embodied action. The attribute "perpetually learning" appears as a label without constraining choices or creating internal friction. Supporting figures in the projection remain instrumental rather than individuated, but at this length and with clear spatial separation (past/present), that's acceptable. The closure choice—pocketing the slide to "reimagine what else alliances can repair"—telegraphs future agency rather than dramatizing a present cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina's motivation is consistently rooted in her mother's death and the question of night-blooming flowers, driving her from the pavilion to the cathedral and through her final discovery. Her interior world is embodied through her art practice, the postcards she carries, and her patient observation in the cloister. The final panel she paints represents a credible change earned by her discovery, though the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor slips: the sacristan and gardeners remain functional tokens without pressure, and Lina's emotional progression is more accumulative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clearly established—"not heroism but to uncover truth in tension"—and embodied choices appear (kneeling to arrange debris, negotiating redaction). However, interiority tilts toward poetic abstraction ("the air thickened and I slipped backward") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final negotiation with Lila earns the renunciation (redaction compromise) with visible cost, but the path feels more contemplative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sen's rejection of false comfort appears repeatedly but functions primarily as a declared trait rather than a dramatized internal contradiction that acts simultaneously in scene. The moment where he feels the bottle's throb and "forced his attention back into working memory" shows competing impulses, but the choice to teach soap-making versus opening the bottle never genuinely tempts him on the page—the renunciation is pre-decided. The returning families and the woman who washes her hands provide external pressure, yet their individual motives remain thin; they exist to validate Sen's plan rather than complicate it with their own contradictory needs. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is asserted ("feared it was temptation") rather than shown through physiological or perceptual change under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Erem's interiority is vivid and particular—his reflex knowledge of dead languages, his third-grade field trip memory anchoring his nerves, his terror at "swearing the city into that failure." The final choice to broadcast the warning is motivated and foreclosed a passive path with visible cost: the Registry will demand "evidence and names" that he cannot provide. Minor tension: his emotional pattern archiving motivation is stated more than dramatized in micro-choices, though the wax-listening sequence embodies it well enough.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation—discovering "the texture of borrowed time"—drives the sorting ritual and entry into the corridor, where he sees his grandmother and understands the vortex inheritance as a cosmic debt requiring order. The insight that his seed work has always been payment lands cleanly. However, the transformation lacks an embodied cost: after the epiphany he simply restores routines and drops a rye grain, tasks that feel administrative rather than renunciatory. The internal arc reads more as clarification than contradiction under pressure, and "furiously tranquil" appears as a repeated label without on-page friction between fury and calm.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is well-motivated through her reflection on village sirens wailing needlessly, and her desire to "favor listening over noise" drives the key switch choice at zero hour. Her "credibly curious" nature manifests in concrete micro-choices—tracking microclimate, tuning the vane—though the trait occasionally reads label-like rather than fully embodied under pressure. Internal conflict is present (Office demands vs. sanctuary peace) but could deepen further; the resolution feels earned by her patient data-gathering and final palm-on-rope decision. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("what people actually needed in a crisis") that slightly flattens interiority in a reflective beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's internal landscape is concretely rendered through embodied grief and selective attention (the yellow glass, charcoal tracings). The progression from armored mourning to porous vulnerability is earned through the meteor-tracing ritual and the logbook discovery. Minor slip: the technicians' sudden appearance and shoulder-softening feels summary-gestural rather than individually dramatized. The final stance—standing within breaking—credibly forecloses the path of isolation with visible cost (reopening the dome, inviting others).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied—"ash that settled on my tongue like vows," "astonishment finally made sound in my chest"—with embodied emotion under pressure. The choice to read the slips aloud is motivated by sustained observation of the ghosts and Mara's gestural cues, earning the final release. Minor deduction: the shift from hoarding to release, while motivated, compresses quickly without visible internal friction or cost articulated on the page before the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's motivation is consistent—seeking texture rather than extension—and the urn fragment embodies grief with specificity. Internal contradiction appears when he sets down the fragment: the act is dramatized but the shift to "timeless, not immortal but unmoored" reads more as authorial declaration than embodied choice under pressure. Mara remains functional but static, applying pressure without her own contradictory impulses. The final duty is earned by prior causality, but the cost (losing his pulse-countdown) lands conceptually rather than viscerally, weakening the embodied throughline at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rian's trait of warmly attentive care is consistently embodied through physical actions (straightening shells, mending nets, wrapping the drake's foot), and his aesthetic philosophy drives concrete choices. Internal contradiction appears when he values incompleteness yet repeatedly repairs things, though this tension isn't fully dramatized as struggle. The poet role allows access to reflective interiority, but several key moments—especially the net-mending—rely on summary rather than showing how his attention constrains tactical choices under pressure. Embodiment is strong in object-handling but thins during the brothers' argument, where "listened for the rhythm of their anger" tells more than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's "brazen calm" and systematic approach show consistent character-particular traits, and her decision to remodel the orchard despite dying demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority remains somewhat distant—her embodied experience of illness is largely absent except for "her chest ached," and the monks' opposition dissolves too easily without forcing a meaningful trade-off that tests her commitment. The final choice to "lay down between the warm pillars" reads more as acceptance than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is dense and character-particular ("luminous skeptic," lab dyes, academically rebellious testing on self), with embodied perception ("teeth ache," blood answering the tower). The final theft is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the scripted pilgrimage path with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is largely absent; the narrator moves through discovery with scientific certainty rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, which keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's interiority is vivid and action-driven—kneeling at the jetty's end, mixing seed pods with silt, speaking the dead languages—embodying occupation and method without therapy-speak. The motivation to fertilize the battlefield is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (pouring kernels, spreading silt, inviting rather than commanding). Internal contradiction surfaces subtly when the narrator asks "whether my small fertilizing can count as peace," revealing doubt that propels the final ritual. The character reads as fully inhabited, though the ending leans slightly toward symbolic fulfillment rather than a felt cost that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio's interior carries strong specificity ("named people by the smells on their sleeves") and the choice to follow Sera's riddle is rooted in a coherent hierarchy of values. The relationship with Morrow as translator of truth provides embodied pressure. Sera's arc—luring scouts, broadcasting betrayal—drives the closure with agency, though her binding feels slightly telescoped and the council's conversion by broadcast lacks visceral friction. Minor: the "tint of red that no desert could keep" edges toward poetic over-grounding without full payoff in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is concretely embodied through the applique and the sketching ritual, with choices constrained by the "blessed pariah" status and temporal disorientation. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between accepting blame and seeking alignment, driven by grief and professional exile. The temporally stretched sensation is well-embodied through breath and sound delays. Minor deduction: the shift from confusion to clarity at the hatch feels slightly accelerated given the weight of accumulated blame.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and character-specific ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful"), and interiority is concrete in key moments (pocket sundial warmth, choosing to open arms to the storm). However, the final choice—trusting the unknown—feels motivated more by abstract philosophy than embodied stakes; the cost of this leap reads conceptual rather than viscerally forfeited. Serren's imprisonment and rescue compress too quickly to accumulate genuine tension or reveal the protagonist's internal contradiction under sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is consistently embodied through micro-choices (pacing UNBIND, splitting bundles, performing panic) that align with the vowed historian role. Interior texture remains specific and contradiction-laden—"benevolently ruthless" drives the peak beat where the narrator rips cord and hides evidence while performing hired panic. The "survivor voice" and bridge trauma anchor present stakes, though the bridge backstory feels slightly inert; it primes the vow but doesn't friction the climax directly. Embodied emotion is strong ("ribs still remembered," "cold air rose") and the final act of freeing the archive while staging theater for guards shows earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's talent for naming and its burial under grief provides a coherent internal motivation that drives the quest and shapes the final choice to reclaim it. The embodied moment—"the pain tried to shut my throat"—anchors the climactic seeding action with visceral cost. However, the seer remains largely a guide with minimal internal contradiction, and the protagonist's emotional progression from numbness to release follows a relatively smooth arc without the messy irrationality that would elevate this into the 8+ range. The final reclamation of the naming gift feels earned but not fully tested by competing impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her chess-tutor lens and physical fidgeting, grounding her internal conflict. The interiority shows genuine contradiction between her tactical mind and regret, particularly visible when she faces her mirrored past self at the gate. However, the prince's war backstory remains abstract—we never see Mara wrestle with a specific remembered move or consequence that would deepen the cost of her exile. The final renunciation ("simply learning to move differently") feels earned but could land harder with one concrete micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path earlier in the maze sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's journey from banished artist to truth-teller is motivated, but her characterization relies heavily on told backstory rather than dramatized contradiction. The witness-to-murder setup and her choice to hide it through art is reported rather than shown through embodied tension. Her final sacrifice reads as motivated by the premise, but the internal conflict between self-preservation and exposure never acts simultaneously in scene. Jalen and the crowd function primarily as mechanisms rather than sources of relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's interiority is richly embodied through alchemy, memory, and physical action; her motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" drives concrete choices (swallowing the draught, diving, matching pockmarks, pouring resin). The final act of forgiveness and the decision to clip the charm as counterbalance show earned transformation with visible cost. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulse in scene, and the brother's death functions more as backstory anchor than live internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interior life is richly textured—his promise to himself, the cracked mirror revelation about keeping distance—and his final admission in the cave is earned through accumulated pressure. The transformation from "intimately aloof" to "ready to paint arrivals" is motivated by the mirror's revelation and the cave confrontation. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on reflection rather than embodied contradiction; the cave monologue ("admitting he has been waiting for a perfect moment to change") edges toward therapy-speak and the climactic choice feels more articulated than struggled through. The closure forecloses aloofness with visible cost, but the path there is more cerebral than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation is embodied through physical trembling and the whispered sentence to Jonas, with internal contradiction evident in the "screaming tenderness" and need to prove softness without quietness. The cork-pressing ritual and garden-scent preparation show micro-choices under pressure. Jonas's transformation from foghorn blasts to forehead-touch represents earned change, though his interior remains thin. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "purifies intentions" framing, but the final choice to "listen for the tremble" demonstrates agency with visible cost to his former method.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The navigator's identity is richly embodied through "patchwork navigator, sewn together from old charts, borrowed languages, and the scars of every route I have survived." Motivation deepens organically from guiding outward caravans to navigating "the geography of loss" for returners, with micro-choices (building the armillary, plotting numbers against star positions) revealing values under pressure. The final recognition—"what I have built is not a machine but a promise"—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of mechanical navigation with visible relational cost. Minor slip: Sera's emotional arc (leaving her son, the reunion) could show more contradictory impulse in the moment of recognition; the "half prayer, half wound opening" gesture skirts label-only emotion but the boy's patient hands anchor it just enough.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and complex—rational forager turned safety-cultivator constrained by involuntary truthfulness. Her micro-choices under pressure (holding the glass eye, occluding vision to control truth) embody contradictory impulses and physical constraint. The final burial choice shows earned stance crystallization with visible cost (choosing secrecy over her reflex honesty). Interior voice remains consistent and character-particular throughout, though the closing phrase "fractured grace" edges toward diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eamon's ability to "take recollections from objects" and "investigate by observing gaps" is embodied through concrete action—pressing the Edelweiss to the post, noticing missing rope scars, deducing alpine cord. His loneliness is legibly enacted through the borrowed-memory mechanism and the final gesture of archiving the stranger's absence. The narrator's witnessing stance remains consistent and filters all perceptions. Internal contradiction appears when Eamon's isolation is both his burden and his purpose, charging the final image with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—her empirical yet intuitive nature shapes her choice at the fork, weighed "like paper in her hands." The final climb is motivated by prior pattern (following ants, trusting experiments) and forecloses the dry passage with visible cost. Ellis's backstory exposition feels slightly inert, but Mara's contradictory pull (anger versus loneliness) acts simultaneously in the cavern scene, and her renunciation of the chip/promise is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maelin's disenchantment is concrete—"tired of prophecies" and "courtiers who offered lacy menace"—and her final choice to enter the fissure and cauterize the wound demonstrates agency with visible cost. Interiority remains consistently embodied through metaphors like "polite and persistent as lace around a throat." Rovan remains functional but sketch-level, serving pressure without full interiority. Minor voice convergence in high diction ("velvet dragged over glass") but the protagonist's hierarchy of values—rejecting both awe and menace—drives the closure choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is established early and drives his choice to release the suns rather than license them, with visible cost (forgoing income, defying the Academy). The interior voice shows contradiction—"scientifically romantic," mixing equations with longing—and the final gesture ("We will be our own measure") flows from this stance. Toma's arc from Academy defector to co-conspirator is clean, though his interiority remains thin. The phrase "directed spontaneity" feels like a clever label rather than an embodied contradiction acting in scene, and emotional states lean toward poetic assertion over visceral embodiment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular—"feral nostalgia" hunts rather than mourns, jealousy targets past selves' unspent chances—and contradictory impulses (warning vs. envying the younger self) act simultaneously in the dream-ridge swap. Motivation is consistent: the lucid-dream chronicler uses the same observational trade to escape panic, and the final choice to "keep writing until the dates behaved" forecloses spiraling and earns stasis with visible cost (accepting authorship over rumor). Minor slip: some reflective passages ("the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it") lean slightly toward exposition, but they anchor in concrete cues (the scroll's sap smell, the grave's letters) and tilt present stance, so BRR is satisfied. The swap and the gratitude beat both show embodied contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iris's motivation to "unveil ordinary miracles" through reading emotional terrain is consistent but her interior life leans toward declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice to deliver the screw herself and stage the father's view shows purposeful agency, but the decision arrives without visible struggle or conflicting impulse acting in the moment. Interiority edges toward label-speak ("trembling calm," "miracle she sought") and therapy-adjacent phrasing at pivotal beats. Her blindness to smell is used as setup but does not constrain her final action with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ila's interiority is concrete and embodied—her scars as contagion, breath held like hot tea, brother's weight on her arms. Internal contradiction appears: childhood superstition both failed and now guides her ("old fears are also runes"). The final choice to write her scars' history earns its cost through the crystallization metaphor, and "something in her chest shed, not skin, but shame" lands as embodied transformation. Minor deduction: the master remains a vessel for exposition rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marin's dual occupation (columnist/exorcist) is well-established and her motives are clear—guilt over June's death drives the apology. Interiority is concrete ("rumor is a nail") and embodied through her shop-work approach. The final choice to write the correction is earned by the prior memory sequence and ghostly exchange, with visible cost (the perfume bottle cracks, the orchard will still fall). Minor: the metaphor-advising trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is present but highly abstract, relying on philosophical language ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions") rather than embodied contradiction. The narrator's decision-making appears declarative and resolved rather than contradictory in the moment. Interior voice remains consistent but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would demonstrate genuine stakes. No secondary character is present, so relationship bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ivar's interiority is concrete and character-particular—his belief that clocks measure "pressure, wear, hunger, and the small human fear between ticks" drives his deliberate mis-winding and his final explanatory choice with the inspector. Embodied emotion appears in "squinted until his eyes watered" and the countdown calming ritual. The ending choice (leaving the mantle clock wrong as "a reminder that meaning is chosen") feels earned by his prior obsession with clock disagreement, though the inspector's anger-to-quiet conversion happens quickly with minimal interior contradiction shown on his side.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The daughter's interior is specific and embodied—"clover melancholy," grief that feels "both lucky and bruised"—and her contradictory impulses (theoretically rebellious yet rule-abiding) generate the scavenger hunt choice. Her gradual shift from wanting to understand his chase to teaching students odds versus cost is earned. The father remains thin; his "palms empty at last" finale feels asserted rather than dramatized, and the final conversation summarizes rather than shows his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is specific and embodied—rubbing the glass disc "until it sang her courage into existence" concretizes her emotional state through action. Her decision to call Lena emerges from credible contradiction: she has "watered that estrangement until it grew thick enough to hide behind" yet her nightly ritual of cultivated distance paradoxically creates wrong-number intimacy that finally compels reconnection. The final beat earns its cost—using the dial-out key she's "not supposed to use" forecloses her safe operator loop. Minor slip: the woman caller's one-laugh hesitation ("like a door that will not open twice") veers momentarily into forced lyricism that slows her revelation, but it doesn't undermine Mara's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is concrete and particular—her walnut-ink archival work embodies her "gently thorough" approach, and the locket triggers contradictory impulses (euphoria/haunt) that act simultaneously when she realizes she whitewashed Jun's death. The final choice to tear out the accident page and replace it with ordinary losses shows agency with visible cost: she publicly dismantles her own record. Minor slip: Jun's mother's sudden appearance feels under-motivated; we lack setup for her presence or her readiness to participate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's journey from loneliness to connection is embodied through micro-choices (giving cigarette, walking Mara home). Mara's "desperately jocular" trait operates on the page—her jokes function as survival tools, revealed in "she made jokes the way others made fire, to keep the dark from sitting too close." The story resists full interiority for Mara, which is appropriate but makes her realization ("not the courier of the cure but its first patient") slightly sudden. The ending choice to pass on the moon rock earns the shift from isolation to reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iris's motivation is clearly established through her brother's death, and her final choice to return and help others in the market is earned. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("grief was a continent," "map with no borders") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The backstory about her brother functions as setup but remains largely ornamental—the panic-in-stone moment feels like symbolic convenience rather than a micro-choice that alters present tactics. Emotional progression from grief-driven seeking to acceptance reads clean but somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior life is vivid and particular—"confidently uncertain" manifests in her choice to keep the pen dry and "imagine words filling themselves later." Her decision to rewrite the courier moment rather than erase the vines shows genuine agency under pressure. The resolution earns its cost through her loosening of certainty, though the shift from garden error to historical editor feels convenient rather than causally motivated. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("thresh meaning from experience") but recovers through embodied detail (the bent nib, the act of unbending).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is densely lyric and embodied through gesture and camera handling, with clear motivation to combat erasure. The father's memory thread provides a contradictory pull between grief and rhythm that grounds the climactic foghorn moment. Aster remains thinly sketched—his "whispering advisor" role and sign-language teaching are told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices on the page. The ending choice to leave the camera as offering feels earned by prior causality, though the stake of being "unseen" is asserted more than tested through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's motivation is clear and consistent—protection through destruction evolving toward revelation—but her interiority leans heavily on declarative summary ("the arsonist in her begging for flame, yet the archivist in her hands wanted preservation") rather than embodied contradiction in action. The relationship with Miko is told through backstory and symbols rather than dramatized friction that alters present choices. Micro-choices exist (scraping the canvas, copying the reel) but feel more like puzzle-solving than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final shift from match to broadcast feels unmotivated by on-page struggle; the renunciation of burning arrives as assertion rather than earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior contradictions are present—signing consent as "a thin mask over a plan"—and the final choice to return alone demonstrates agency with cost. However, much interiority leans on elevated poetic phrasing ("auroral sorrow," "constellation of gestures") that occasionally distances embodied emotion. Dr. Sato's arc from scientist to co-mourner is sketched but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is characterized through specific, embodied skill (identifying walks, map-folding) and her choices meaningfully alter tactics under pressure. The stevedore rescue demonstrates competence tested against genuine obstacles. Internal experience differs from external composure in a character-specific way ("calculated spontaneity"). Minor slip: the trait of keeping secrets "not for power but because secrets travel best when they are quiet" edges toward self-aware diagnostic phrasing that no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's silent empathy is embodied through gesture and staging rather than label, with his spiraling calm enacted via the shutter-weaving. The girl's guilt is dramatized through the mirror descent and blood on her chin, earning the final confession. Interiority remains concrete: "unsaid words clung to her tongue like silt." Minor slip: the guardian's motivation ("teach darkness the value of stars") leans slightly abstract, though his actions ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's motivation is clear and his listening ability is consistent, but his interior contradiction is minimal—he moves smoothly from observation to plan to execution without genuine struggle. The students remain undifferentiated save for their collective excitement, and the mayor's shift feels more convenient than earned; her nephew mention arrives late and does little causal work. The final choice (delay → land trust) lacks visible cost on Eli's part; he offers tea and a question, and the system bends.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between belonging to the dock and answering the sea's call is embodied through specific actions—coiling hawsers, diving for chains, refusing to bind what wants freedom. The micro-choices (pressing the scrimshaw into Rusk's hand, using the knife as lever) reveal hierarchy of values. Rusk's arc from binding to releasing his daughter is earned through the scrimshaw's heart-opening and his memory of her whale-song. Minor slip: the protagonist's transformation feels slightly telescoped in the final beats, though the renunciation of the apron carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory—touching the dried bouquet "too often, trying to feel anything other than the emotional void" is embodied grief work. Orin's confession "landed without drama, like a stone into snow" shows his moral ambiguity through metaphor and the narrator's decision to keep him despite his mandate history creates visible friction. The final choice to release the bouquet is earned by the accumulated ritual work, though the line "I understood that lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to reach her brother is concrete, and her use of paraphrase to soften boundaries shows agency. However, her interior life remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "aesthetically driven" and "hunger she cannot rhyme away" gesture toward personality without grounding it in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Soren is present but applies only mild pressure; his warning and recoil feel more atmospheric than a true crucible. The final transformation into "simply air" lacks embodied cost; we see dissolution but not the felt price of crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's "innocently cunning" trait is established through the plant-language negotiation and her portrait gambit, but her interiority remains thin—we see tactics without the contradictory impulses that would charge her choices. Joren's fear of emptiness and his greed are told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The colorblindness functions as backstory explanation rather than a live constraint that alters her perception or tactics in scene. The final exchange feels transactional rather than emotionally costly, with the "borrowed starlight" insight arriving as a neat swap rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority shows through the prism-bell work and the stance on connection versus signal, but key choices feel more prompted than earned—particularly the shift to "raw archive" honesty, which arrives without prior dramatized struggle between loyalty and truth. Mara's arc from engineer-auditor to collaborator proceeds smoothly but lacks embodied contradiction; her admission of doctored reports lands as plot information rather than a moment of genuine cost. The protagonist's response ("my job was to ring truths without shattering hands") reads as aphoristic rather than wrestling with stakes. Micro-choices under pressure remain sparse; much decision-making is summarized rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's arc from "hands that still shook" to "subdued ardor" and "the steady heat of a forge kept low" is earned through concrete micro-choices: leaving birds, shaping the ring, standing within curtains. Internal contradiction appears when she admits lost faith yet immediately engages Sen's method, and the final image shows her meeting strangers with purpose "not their past," a credible renunciation of oblivion. The husband's imagined presence late in the piece adds embodied cost without therapy-speak. Minor: Lysa and other strangers remain functional but thin, limiting relationship crucible; Mara's jewelry-making identity is declared but not leveraged in her actions beyond ring-smithing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's "steadily curious" interiority reads as consistent, though the shift from passive observation to active collaboration with Aurel is somewhat telescoped. Grandmother's character comes through her notebooks and measuring method with embodied particularity. The final choice—to publish findings and return when the city changes—feels earned but lacks visible cost beyond time commitment. Internal contradiction is present (curiosity vs. caution) but not tested under sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's curiosity is present and drives the descent, but interior contradiction remains thin: the pull toward forbidden knowledge versus safety is declared rather than dramatized in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("my joy at nearing it hurt like a pulled tooth"), yet peak beats lean on abstract claims ("atoms of nostalgia") rather than visceral sensation. The final choice to teach in spirals feels asserted without visible cost that forecloses a prior path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is highly wrought but her choices emerge from consistent observation rather than contradictory impulses. The shadow's metamorphosis is motivated by recognition rather than struggle, which flattens the protagonist's agency at closure. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (the river-stone rubbing, hand tightening) but much is conveyed through elaborate metaphor rather than bodily sensation. The final "borrowable light" turn feels declared more than earned through visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal conflict between anger and compassion is embodied through concrete micro-choices (writing two lists, calling Tessa, preparing intake forms). The decision to file the report while offering aid demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the therapeutic framing ("layers of pride, anger, and easy certainty") edges toward label-speak, though the subsequent actions ground it. The chameleon's shed tail functions as an earned motif that charges her final choice without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is coherent—she seeks meaning through her wound rather than accepting closure—and embodied choices (peeling gauze, descending despite pain, reopening stitches) anchor the arc. The "closure seeker who opens wounds" contradiction generates real pressure. However, the pivotal diagnostic skill (reading trauma in coffee rings) functions as ornament rather than lived competence; the ivy's telepathic whispers and the healer's backstory arrive without prior grounding, weakening causal weight. The final wound "knitting legible" reads as conceptual payoff but lacks embodied cost that would elevate the choice into genuine renunciation or transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and distinct—her spatial imagination maps emotions to coordinates, and her search for unused love drives tactile choices (warming the can, threading the strip). The psychometry vision of Eli is embodied through grease-pencil stains and hushed voice, though the vision itself risks summary. Her final act—reading her own letters into the light—earns a stance shift with visible cost (tearing up prior letters, then committing to "deliver"). Minor: Lena remains abstract, known only through Eli's longing, but at this length secondary figuration is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sel's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction remains largely abstract—the "moonstruck dreamer" feels more archetypal than particular. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("hands shook with cold and awe"), but peak moments lean on poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to unlock the vault is signaled throughout yet lacks visible cost; Sel stands "exhausted" but no path is foreclosed with felt consequence. The renunciation or endurance that would earn Stasis is gestured at but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guard's motivation to "cultivate sparks" is specific and drives micro-choices across ledgers and timelines. Interiority remains consistent through wave-function splitting without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to meet auditors "in many places at once" with a charm is coherent but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; the ending feels more like sustained vigilance than transformation. Embodied emotion is thin—pressure is atmospheric rather than somatically registered.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philosopher's motivation is specific and embodied through concrete details (the gear on the palm, the hum in the ribs), and the translocation delivers a series of realized fears (the cog-bridge over magnets, the orchids that open unwatched). However, the protagonist's agency remains largely receptive—following, listening, waking—rather than making choices that foreclose options with visible cost. The cathedral scene gestures toward transformation ("I began to unravel the argument I had lived by") but the change is asserted through summary rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior journey from fear to courage is traced through embodied moments—shaking hands, heavy feet, the dog's weight against her—and her reflections on broken leashes gain micro-choice friction when she chooses the darkest descent. However, the guides remain wise-elder archetypes without contradiction or embodied struggle; their patience and wisdom are asserted rather than tested. The closing image of holding the leash loosely earns some cost, but the epiphany about "unused courage" skirts therapy-speak. Interiority is occasionally generic ("fear turns her feet heavy") and the emotional arc resolves tidily without the grit of genuine flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bellhop protagonist shows clear internal contradiction—bound by policy yet morally troubled—and makes a decisive final choice to whisper "C" that forecloses the safe path with visible cost (the REMAIN alert, footsteps approaching). Embodied emotion is strong: "the cost of safety like cold metal under my tongue," "frost in her breath looked like a small flag of surrender." Edda's embodied struggle (cracked lips, trembling smile, numb fingers waking) creates genuine pressure on the protagonist's stance. Minor slip: the technician's badge "REMAIN" feels slightly convenient as exposition, but the choice itself is earned and the renunciation of enforced silence carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orun's motivation to unmask the pretender is clear and sustained, and his "regally unpretentious" trait appears twice as a frame. However, interiority remains thin throughout—his emotional state during the library collapse and his refusal of the crown lack embodied contradiction or cost. The final renunciation feels asserted rather than earned by prior internal conflict, and his ease with danger (no fear, hesitation, or physical strain) flattens the pressure that should test his character.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her sensory avoidance of the bleached reef, the tactile practice of tapping rhythms, and her deliberate choice of measurement over mourning ground motivation clearly. The final choice to encode the beacon schedule into tapping is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of transparent guidance with visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces when she "wanted to argue that hiding routes was a kind of lie" yet immediately accepts the logic and becomes complicit, showing genuine conflict. Minor weakness: the hooded woman's explanation arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, slightly softening the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilya's interiority shows specificity ("awkwardly confident" manifests in physical gesture and delayed reactions), and her motivation to find meaning drives micro-choices like sitting in the circle and tuning the console. The notebook functions as an anchor for goal pursuit, and her shaking hands embody contradictory resolve. However, the final moment lacks visible cost; she "did not hide" but the stakes of being discovered remain abstract, and no relationship pressure tests her stance on the page—Sael is absent, the footsteps are a shadow without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nara's agency is clear: she rejects implanted destiny and seeks evolution through understanding. The micro-choice network is strong—her instruction to gather reeds, the decoding collaboration, the intentional imprinting story at the unsealing. Interior state is embodied (tight braids as coded orders, the single surprised laugh) but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under peak pressure; her calm throughout is consistent but never shows competing desires wrestling in scene. The protagonist's final witness-and-counterweight role grows from dramatized events but remains somewhat passive at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mina's interior life is grounded in embodied trauma markers (wet palms, soft knees, copper taste) that constrain her choices. The mid-sentence freeze and subsequent request to the drone operator show genuine cost. The final choice to leave the photograph at the cypress base demonstrates earned renunciation with visible stakes. Minor slip: Dr. Harlow's interiority remains underdeveloped, but he serves primarily as pressure vessel rather than co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation—portraits fracturing, seeking redesign through untangling—reads coherently and her descent is earned by her mother's note and the Tower card. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("bleed light into uncertainty," "layered stories") that sometimes abstracts emotion rather than embodying it. The sister's stakes remain shadowy; we never see Mara wrestle with contradictory impulses about whether to pursue rescue or accept fracture, flattening what could be a richer internal conflict. The final shift—accepting fracture, painting with calm—lands but feels more announced than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Keir's interior stance ("serene anger," "consciously wild") is articulated but often told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The motivation to discover time-slowing is clear, but the character's journey from observer to actor arrives quickly without the embodied struggle that would earn the final resolve. Micro-choices exist (pouring ink, sending the drone, driving the knife) but feel more like plot functions than character-revealing decisions under pressure. The final promise reads as stated wisdom rather than a cost-bearing reconfiguration of his internal landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is well-rendered through embodied hesitation ("My hands shook") and the choice to feed the letter into the console reflects a hierarchy of values—protecting Mara versus forcing transparency—with visible cost. The motivation driving the archivist is consistent and intensifies under pressure, though the swift pivot from fear to action could have shown more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment of decision. Mara's nod at the end and the Censor's pivot feel credible given the established power dynamics, but secondary characters remain functional rather than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris's decision to sheathe her father's rifle and force him into attention shows agency with cost, and Tarek's shift from bounty hunter to planter is grounded in the roses' trained refusal. The interior life is handled largely through action rather than label-speak. However, the opening establishes Maris as "senselessly perceptive" and able to "hear thirst before the leaves curl," yet this trait never constrains a choice or creates friction—she moves through the dome without struggle. Tarek's transformation occurs rapidly within a single scene; while the roses provide external pressure, his internal conflict between order-hunger and paternal receptiveness could be more contradictory and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rovan's character is grounded in concrete choices—zigzag walking to break rhythm, voicing silence, releasing the spike—that arise from established traits (cool-headed, respectful of patterns). His final renunciation is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost (empty hands, echo sealed away). Minor slip: Mera's gift is vividly described but her interiority remains thin, operating more as functional support than a fully contradictory presence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Celeste's motivation is rooted in her father's legacy and expressed through concrete observational choices—hearing Lyle's tremor, watching Sato's hands, testing contradictions via logbook. The "orbit of regret" metaphor recurs but occasionally slides toward label-speak ("he felt an orbit of regret begin to pull at her"). Sato's confession arrives with embodied guilt (the flickered expression, the colleague's death), and Celeste's final bargain feels earned by prior causal pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "orbit of regret" framing in the middle third, but the closure choice—forcing honesty through documented contradictions—lands with visible cost and alters Sato's path.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interior guilt is embodied through the needle buzz as underwater crying, and the decision to follow the letters flows from that concrete pressure. The final choice—speaking the apology and accepting the "muted" guilt—forecloses his old stance with visible cost. However, the constellation-tattooist occupation remains ornamental; it seeds motifs but never constrains a choice. The emotional progression from haunted sessions to closure is legible, though the translator's voice and Dr. Sato's explanation arrive as exposition rather than discovered resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Inez is established with concrete traits (chalk artist, socially perceptive) and a clear goal. Her interiority is sometimes overwrought—"whimsical chalk artist who drew birds that looked ready to sing" reads as external labeling rather than interior contradiction. The closing choice to allow the boy to smudge the mandala demonstrates character through action, but the arc lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; her final statement about meaning "only lived while it was being touched" feels closer to aphorism than earned cost. Motivation is present but the stakes never sharpen into genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Samir's motivation is embodied through the iron frame and Grasp design, with concrete choices that reveal values under pressure. The retrocognitive trap provides a believable constraint that shapes his watching-as-tool methodology. Lina's arc from vengeance to truce is earned through the forced watching and her cousin's recognition. Minor slip: the cousin's trembling at the end feels slightly summarized rather than shown through specific gesture, and Samir's "warmth that felt cold" risks abstraction without sufficient grounding in action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's synesthetic perception is vivid and embodied (tinny blue applause, green velvet air), grounding her motivation to stay after hours. Her choice to help Silas is driven by the shared stake of luring possibility from despair, shown through the coin and her father's memory. However, the final act—whispering her father's name into the wood—feels unmotivated by prior character work; the connection between this personal memory and Silas's release is asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or struggle. Silas himself remains passive, a figure waiting for rescue rather than an agent whose choices complicate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's affectionate-skeptic trait is embodied early (hugs friends, doubts miracles) and drives her empirical test design rather than dismissal. Her squeeze of Jory's hand and choice to test rather than believe show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final refusal-hug of the lawyer lands with character consistency. However, her arc from skepticism to "learned to listen for paths" feels more like thematic assertion than earned transformation; the specific cost of her stance shift remains unclear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mina's interior is richly specific—her sensory training shapes perception ("taste air currents, read salt on stone"), and her motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" drives concrete choices under escalating pressure. The heat-mapping method embodies emotion without diagnostic labels, and the pivot from personal comfort (fossil as talisman) to recognizing non-human presence shows contradictory impulses resolving into stance. Minor slip: the handprint discovery and Mina's leap to "transitional object between species" feels slightly unearned; the connection is declared more than tested through micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lysa's motivation to democratize the prophecy is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—"quietly inspired" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's teaching and button-sorting are told in summary; we never see Lysa hesitate, doubt, or make a trade-off that reveals her hierarchy of values. The foreman's attempt to seize the jar arrives too late to test her commitment in scene, and the workers' collective action diffuses individual agency at the closure moment. Emotion is labeled ("fear that wrapped the warehouse like resin") rather than dramatized through perception and bodily response.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rina's motive ("to find where unused courage waits") shapes her return and repair actions, though the language borders on abstract. Her memory of the betrayal and the child is embodied through the pillbox ritual, but the internal contradiction remains understated—she moves through scenes with more symbolic clarity than messy self-conflict. The final choice to leave the pillbox and rebuild the chain feels earned by her prior causality, but the arc reads more as thematic illustration than a protagonist wrestling with contradictory impulses in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rowan's motivation is grounded in grief and embodied through the yarn needle, creating clear stakes. His "closely attentive" trait manifests in concrete observations (wet boots, salt-stiff sleeves) that drive plot decisions. Senn's admission feels slightly convenient but serves the causal chain. Minor weakness: Mara remains more symbol than person, though the scope allows this.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Galen's characterization is embodied and specific: "held the lantern the way he held unfired bowls, with sharp gentleness" grounds his potter's identity in gesture. His motivation to understand resistance is enacted through concrete micro-choices—rotating the lantern, testing shadows—rather than declared. Sera is more thinly sketched but applies immediate pressure. The final choice (centering the lantern) feels earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible: the oasis moves, the preserved combs crumble into "honest dust."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's wistfully pragmatic stance is embodied through concrete choices—keeping seedlings alive in wind, translating mirror-shard instincts to harbor locks—and her fear channeled into task drives escalation cleanly. Jonas is less developed but functional; his lock-gauge trust creates the crucible without becoming fully dimensional. Interior texture stays consistent ("fear without a task is what kills her") and the final tending of the rosebush earns stasis through prior causality. Minor: the smuggler threat remains abstract, lowering antagonistic pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior voice is consistently specific and embodied: "the guilt had followed me through death" carries concrete weight. Micro-choices accumulate pressure through the sundial sequence, translating vibration into script then into a plan with visible cost ("letting errors show"). The final stance—carrying the hum without needing forgiveness—is earned by the stone-circle encounter. Minor slip: the jump from "watched those pairs fail to coexist with our hunger" to actionable refuge instructions feels slightly telescoped, though the thematic through-line holds.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—keeping secrets professionally while longing for connection—are embodied in the pivotal choice to withhold Arin's letter and then finally confess. Interior work is concrete and character-particular ("the silence felt like a tug on some hidden thread"), though the whimsy occasionally edges toward performed quirk. The final renunciation (admitting the hidden apology) carries visible cost and alters the relationship, earning the closure. Minor slip: the "inevitably whimsical" label is asserted rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to outwit the tricksters is clear and drives her final action, but her interiority relies heavily on observational summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The manager and physics chair appear only as externalized obstacles without distinct psychological pressure or status dynamics. Her final choice to hand over the recordings feels somewhat abrupt; the renunciation lacks visible cost that would elevate it to earned stasis—she simply explains her insight rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's trait of claustrophobic-yet-adventurous is shown through concrete choices (listening for the organ, keeping the sky in mind, striking the compass into mortar), and the mentor's transparent form earns pathos. However, interiority relies heavily on metaphor and declaration rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously; peak moments like "fear was only another measurement" read as thesis rather than lived experience. The final choice to plant the compass point feels motivated by the scene's logic, though the emotional cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's face-blindness is told rather than embodied through concrete misrecognitions or compensatory behaviors under pressure. Internal contradiction exists (methodical artist vs. "to awaken dormant empathy"), but the motives never clash on the page in a way that forecloses options. Maren's confession arrives through dialogue summary rather than dramatized resistance, flattening the peak choice into exposition. The narrator's final offer ("I offer to paint...if she tells the truth") reads transactional rather than earned through prior struggle with her own blindness.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's idealism and drive to honor her ancestor provide clear motivation, and her choices (climbing to the cemetery, confronting Sato) advance the plot. However, interiority remains largely abstract—"dread in her chest felt spongey" is memorable but not deeply embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "nervously confident" attribute appears as a label twice without constraining choices or showing internal friction. Micro-choices feel functional rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and specific ("bridge-song fiddler," observation habits), but agency remains limited—most key events (hitchhiker appearance, his vanishing, discovery of the camera) happen *to* the protagonist rather than through protagonist-driven choices that narrow options. The decision to photograph oneself arrives late and feels more like following instructions than wrestling with contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present in lines like "felt a legal future loosening its grip," yet the final choice lacks visible on-page cost; no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is consistent and specific (highway robber's son, LoopLine builder, train dweller), with embodied detail like "my eyes stay still when my mind is running." The arc from father's lessons to marking territory differently shows internal contradiction and earned shift. However, key emotional beats lean toward summary rather than scene pressure—the moment he realizes the bills record repetitions is told reflectively instead of dramatized as a choice under duress. Mara's final question and the protagonist's response feel slightly expository rather than emerging from immediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation—decode the temple—is clear and embodied through dream chronicling, but interior texture is thin and sometimes generic ("midnight solace that lets pain be spoken"). Nera's grief is told more than shown in micro-choices; the scene where the narrator takes her hands and promises to carry part of her burden reads as therapeutic assertion rather than dramatized cost. The final act (traveling to the temple, performing the rite) contains decisions, but the narrator's own contradictory impulses remain largely off-page. Stock phrasing like "quiet weight settling into the ribs" and "carries forward with realistic inertia" slightly flatten voice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thalen's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("guarded druid...trained for war yet sworn to keep my voice calm as a drawn blade"), and the motivation to discover what mirrors hide drives the descent. However, the final choice to plant the seed and sing feels somewhat externalized—more enacted than internally conflicted. The twin's frozen apology and the conjurer's stage-trick backstory add depth, but Thalen's own stake in the confession remains slightly abstract. Embodied contradiction under pressure is present but muted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's "purposefully curious even when fear tightened her throat" establishes motive, and her willingness to bleed for the covenant shows stakes-driven choice. The visionary's root-bound state is vivid and his scarred linking system creates textural specificity. However, the mother's reappearance feels under-motivated—she appears as "a sleeper standing at the same crossing" without prior contradiction or tension that her presence resolves, and the reunion lacks visible cost or complication. The piece gestures toward internal conflict (anxious elation, fear vs. curiosity) but doesn't sustain contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; emotions toggle rather than layer.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's "fiercely gentle" characterization is consistently embodied through micro-choices: bandaging a thief, refusing to brighten the lantern, choosing suffering-as-lock over theft. Her final bargain—trading her ability to forget pain—arises from established traits and forecloses a path with visible cost ("woke each morning with yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn"). Internal contradiction operates cleanly when she steadies "the old loss flare" with "dusky resolve," showing contradictory impulses in scene. Minor slip: Jory remains a passive beneficiary rather than a pressure source, reducing relational crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction—reinventing himself to avoid feeling, then being forced back into emotional territory—drives key choices throughout. The motives are clearly traced from televised failure through isolation via facts to final recognition that "purpose was not applause but what you do after it." Embodied emotion appears in concrete moments (hands remembering catalog numbers, pinning cloth to corkboard), though the final epiphany risks slight over-articulation. The arc from emotional insulation to connection is earned by the scrap's physical handling and Marla's brother revelation, with visible cost in the protagonist's professional identity shift.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nerin's motivation is grounded in embodied grief (the weight-drop sensation carried upward) and his internal conflict between measurement and compassion is concrete. The sister Mara is felt through memory arranged into present pressure ("placing her laughter beside his guilt"), and his micro-choices—wiring the seed, releasing the light—show hierarchy of values with visible cost. One slip: the "kindly methodical" attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page contradictory impulses in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through the titan-gear and neoprene gloves, with the creel-fishing ritual revealing values under pressure. The moon-phase memory mechanic creates genuine constraint and the final acceptance of forgotten identity feels earned. However, Captain Lio/Aunt Liora and the city's migrating identities remain largely external to the narrator's internal conflict; the protagonist observes and catalogs more than they wrestle with contradictory impulses in scene. The closing moment—receiving a new name and accepting dual identity—lands cleanly but the path there prioritizes atmospheric accumulation over sharp internal contradiction acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows specificity in her professional lens ("tapping steel doors," "unspoken fears that clung to the concrete"), and her micro-choice to ask about the pearl opens the widower's confession. However, the final turn—her decision to crown the entrance with the pearl and file noncompliant—arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost; she simply "understood" and "saw her job differently" in what reads as an unearned epiphany. The widower's confession lands with embodied detail ("shaking hands," "fingering a cultivated pearl"), but his arc from sealing the door on neighbors to standing beside Mara feels rushed and externally resolved by the pearl's magic rather than his own struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("I tell myself I am here for data, but really I am looking for a path to self-forgiveness"), with embodied contradictions that drive choices under pressure. The final act—photographing the corroded latch and sending the report—is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional over-articulation ("the truth feels less like punishment and more like shelter") that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, though it remains grounded in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (recovering swallowed sentences), and the final choice to mail the apology is earned by the library experience. Interiority shows concrete progression through cautious exuberance → active documentation → recognition of personal culpability. However, the character remains somewhat passive—the library and watch drive most revelations rather than protagonist agency forcing difficult trade-offs. The emotional arc from fear to release lacks embodied contradiction; no moment shows him wrestling with competing impulses simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's interior is vivid and embodied—"mulberry ache in my throat," green murmurs from plants—with consistent motivations: her childhood dream versus imperial demands. The plant telepathy trait shapes on-page choices (listening to figs, following their map through the vent), and her final choice to send the violin away forecloses a path with visible cost (blank report, envoy's threat). Minor slip: the envoy and Sorell remain functional rather than deeply contradictory presences, and the basil's "promise to keep quiet" feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's profession is rendered with vivid specificity ("brushing hair into flattering arcs after breath had fled"), and her motivation to capture sparks is established early. However, her internal contradiction remains largely assertion rather than enacted struggle—she fears the threshold "not for herself but for her clients" but this stance is never tested by competing impulses on the page. The final choice to release the spark into the aurora feels thematically apt but lacks visible cost; we don't see what she foregoes or what path this forecloses, only that she descends "with empty hands and a steadier breath."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's caretaker role is embodied through pruning and climbing, and her interior question about contentment grounds the journey. The brother's guilt-driven arrival in the grotto vision offers potential reconciliation, but the actual decision to assign him replanting work happens off-page, weakening the earned change. The mother-figure's condensation appearance and Mara's hairpin offering feel more symbolic gesture than contradiction-in-scene pressure. Interiority occasionally slips into abstraction ("emptiness was not a hole but a furrow") rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's character is constructed through embodied particulars—her paid conscience role, her method of "sincerely insincere" engagement, her learned decoding of wind chimes. Interiority is present and character-specific, with her internal voice filtering through metaphors ("stacked stones," "cool smoke"). However, the final decision feels more announced than wrestled with; the cloak's tightening serves as external prompt rather than dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously in the scene. The arc from hired justifier to honest truth-teller lands, but the pivot lacks visible cost that forecloses her prior stance with embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation and perceptual specificity are strong—the decision to accept Sato's teaching and the attention to ripple patterns under pressure show purposeful interiority. Sato's aging trajectory is signaled but his choices remain largely reactive; the final vanishing reads more as mechanical consequence than a dramatized decision with visible internal conflict. The embodied detail (taste of pennies, breath like confession) grounds emotion well, but the ending forecloses agency for Sato without showing him weigh the cost of losing language versus preserving knowledge. The narrator's arc is primarily receptive, which suits the premise but limits contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Oren's motivation to navigate without moving is established early and drives his choices. Interiority is highly specific ("sending his aim by listening") but tilts toward poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—holding the image gently and sending resonance—reads as earned through the on-page humming ritual, though the internal conflict between wanting to leap and staying still could be more embodied. Emotional states remain consistent, filtered through reverence and weathered resolve, but lack the messiness of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Davin's motivation is embodied through concrete choices (unstrapping the harness, mist walking, arranging frost-petals) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His interiority—"failures, softened by vapor, no longer felt like proof of worthlessness"—is specific and avoids therapy-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the keystone in place) forecloses a path with visible cost and reads as earned. Minor weaknesses: the automaton's threat remains abstract, reducing the felt weight of Davin's refusal, and some introspective passages ("the sacred had been misfiled into a ledger") edge toward label-only claims.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lamplighter's pursuit of sound-as-color anchors a clear interior contradiction (honesty-as-screen versus private vow), and the underwater passage embodies concrete choices under pressure. However, the protagonist's central shift—speaking the vow and experiencing violet—feels more like a granted epiphany than an earned consequence of prior struggle; the "promising to hear without wanting" resolves tension cleanly without visible internal cost. The character remains consistent, but the final transformation arrives too easily, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior texture is distinctly rendered through her relationship with coins and prophecy, treating static as "broken syllable[s] in a language spoken backward" with consistent perceptual bias. Her "quiet enthusiasm" manifests in concrete micro-choices (casting coins, calibrating feeds, locking the transmitter despite doubt). The final laugh and realization feel earned by prior contradiction between her method and the crew's fear. Minor: the chief engineer and crew remain functional pressure-appliers without distinct voices, but at this length and with clear spatial choreography, headcount does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The heartbroken reaper's interiority is richly embodied through specific gestures (palm to paper, fingertip in dust) and the voice maintains consistent contradiction between duty and grief. The motivation to name fears is rooted in personal loss (the lover "carried away without goodbye") and drives concrete choices throughout. Minor slip: the phrase "echo of sacrifice" risks abstraction, though it's grounded in the recordings' cutoff voices. The final choice to carry "new names like distant intimacies" earns stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Evin's earnest naivete and lukewarm magic are embodied through concrete choices—timing his breath to drips, using weak spells that "barely steam." His devotion is shown as "brittle"—strong when untouched, splintering under the steward's laughter—a contradiction enacted on the page. The bell-mending sequence demonstrates his mechanical worldview through micro-choices (counting drops, mixing silt with mica). Minor weakness: the final "almost smiles at the plausibility" edges toward telling rather than letting the embodied relief speak.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is consistently rooted in observation and duty, with concrete micro-choices ("I took it because our office had once cataloged…"). Her discovery sequence is causally linked to incremental photograph matching, showing investigative focus rather than epiphany. The final choice—photographing evidence and speaking at the town meeting—forecloses the path of silence with visible cost to her father's legacy. Minor issue: the phrase "precisely humane" and some reflective passages lean toward label-speak ("the lie we lived in") without full embodiment, though her actions ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's internal contradiction between logic and sentimentality is named but rarely dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her choice to follow the starlings' pattern and "let intuition set the rhythm" represents a decision, but the synthesis feels philosophically asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing pulls. The embodied emotion is present in moments like "her hands shook at the thought of the council's eyes," yet much of the interiority skews toward lyric summary ("the touch of wonder in her chest like a door opening") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The final transformation lacks visible cost—she succeeds cleanly, smiling at the result, with no path foreclosed or trade-off made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is embodied through tactile habit (the buckle) and sensory focus (listening, counting nicks), with motivation rooted in the watcher's burden rather than personal stakes. Internal conflict appears in "I wanted to accuse him, yet my duty was to preserve trust," though it resolves quickly into procedural competence. The choice to bind the impostor rather than let him fall shows moral calculus, but the decision feels more职业 obligation than contradictory impulse acting simultaneously. Emotional embodiment is strong in the opening and closure, though the middle leans procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's post-ego-death clarity is established early and shapes perception throughout, but the internal texture remains somewhat abstract—"empty drum" and "numbness" are repeatedly asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. The final choice to invite both factions onto the mat and guide them into shared breath demonstrates agency, though the leap from numbness to facilitation feels under-motivated by prior micro-choices. The clone body's shudder "from attention given without ownership" introduces a late mechanism that borders on convenient resolution, slightly undercutting earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bram's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical ritual—he macerates leaves, conducts blowers, carries the pull cord like a talisman. His contradictory state (mournfully eager, aching to try superstition) drives the tunnel work and shows genuine struggle without therapy-speak. The wife and son appear only in framing and closing beats; their reactions at the end feel earned by Bram's prior causality, though they remain thinly sketched. Internal conflict between grief and desperate hope is consistent, and the final choice to place the handle on the windowsill signals readiness to repeat the ritual with visible cost (continued isolation, reliance on magical thinking).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's dimensional homesickness is vividly embodied through the pendant's warmth and inward doorway vision, creating concrete motivation. The guardian's feral years as defense against threshold terror shows internal contradiction acted in scene. The final choice to turn attention inward together rather than open the way demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost (forgoing the impossible home). Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("color that lived just past the last visible wavelength") rather than purely character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal landscape is established through embodied metaphor ("tears had learned to stand at attention"), and her final choice to transform the crozier carries visible cost—risk of punishment she admits aloud. Jun's penny-drop realization provides a clean micro-turn, though his fear and hesitation read slightly mechanical. The "stoically sensitive" trait appears as label more than constraint; it does not visibly force a trade-off in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and task-driven; her choices to invert the fragment's placement and dismantle the mast are earned by her professional idiom and her habit of "discarding assumptions." The embodied detail—tool belt, wrenches, sore hands—grounds her agency. Minor slip: the insight "beginnings are built with sore hands" veers toward epigram without full dramatic cost in that moment, though the preceding action supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lina's motivation to merge parallel timelines is grounded in her observed goodbyes on the gangway, and her final choice—to radio the harbor office in coded constellation-speak—emerges from her established habits (checking lines twice, whistling). Her resiliently positive attribute is embodied in action ("climbed back to her own ferry…with fear in her throat") rather than merely labeled. The older self functions as a clean mirror rather than a full secondary character, avoiding muddy choreography. Minor slip: the leap from "not to stop the mystery but to merge parallel timelines" reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, edging toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—fever-driven architectural thinking, the notebook as lifeline, memories that "slip like wet paper"—and embodied through the sinew work. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between rational control and delirium, and the choice to "let it erupt" then anchor names in the lattice feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the father/mother backstory, while anchored to present stimuli, occasionally drifts toward summary rather than micro-choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical handling of the chain link and her request for surface ascent. Her "balanced curiosity" manifests in concrete micro-choices—comparing the probe's lattice, teaching edge geometry—though the trait itself leans toward label. The mourning divers and council tension create pressure, but secondary characters (Jae, guards, students) remain functional supports without autonomous stakes. Internal contradiction is minimal; Mara's arc follows a steady discovery path with only modest friction between curiosity and communal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's professional curiosity and personal grief are established, but her interior contradictions remain muted under pressure. The choice to sit beside Eli and trace the call through the hearing aid shows agency, yet the emotional cost feels more asserted than embodied—"her own throat felt full of ash" tells rather than showing degradation. The final beat offers endurance rather than transformation, which fits Earned Stasis, but the visible price paid on the page is thin. Eli's arc from suicidal ideation to walking back with Mara compresses too quickly without sufficient on-page struggle or micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's claustrophobia is embodied through breath-counting and palm-to-wall grounding, creating genuine internal friction. Her motivation to honor Ken is concrete and drives her through measurable cost (terror in the gap). The brother remains off-page, so relational pressure is indirect but the grief-versus-duty calculus shapes every choice. Minor slip: "tried to turn into a shout" reads slightly abstract where a more visceral rendering would sharpen the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's compulsive heartbeat counting is embodied and shapes her perception under pressure, stopping at "six thousand, two hundred, and one" when she realizes she's been "counting heartbeats to deny loss, not to honor life"—an earned shift. Lyle's digital ghost persona remains consistent through voice and fragmented memory. The final stance ("correctly recorded, a living person carrying a ghost's hard-won calm") feels earned by the ink-ritual micro-choices and his guidance. Minor: the "officially dead" bureaucratic struggle is declared more than dramatized in micro-choices before the resolution file arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilen's obsession to preserve Vey through sensory translation is concrete and drives his experiments with the diamond and canyon. His micro-choices—timing whispers to bird-flight, scraping the bone floor with copper-veined fingers—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The night Toma dies and the swifts don't fly, Ilen's solo improvisation (breathing aligned to the late flock's spiral) shows contradictory impulses: desperation versus methodical craft. Minor slip: the elders' consonants "softening" is told rather than dramatized through failed speech attempts on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear—professional bitterness driving her undercover work—and her arc from skeptical researcher to someone who chooses anchored hands over pure documentation feels earned. The interior voice is specific ("grief people carried behind their teeth"), though Jonas's character relies heavily on atmospheric detail rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His final choice to offer bitterness as a punchline rather than price provides the closure shift, but the metamorphosis threat feels more described than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Edda remains functional support rather than a pressure source with her own competing stake.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's motivation is dramatized through micro-choices: hiding his bow, using the locust shell, matching his pulse to the tree's rhythm. Internal contradictions register when "his violin hand shake[s] with the same anger that once made his father trade songs for factory wages"—personal wound driving choice. The final decision to lead the tree into the city with violin raised crystallizes his values with visible cost (statue seizure, struggle). Minor: the statues' transformation at closure lacks sufficient on-page causality; their "faces softened by pear-scented dust" feels asserted rather than earned by prior contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ivo's mailman role is richly embodied through his careful ink, polite bows, and satchel as parcel metaphor. His decision to foster Nela and to confront the smugglers shows genuine cost (signing the guardian form, risking treason). The "looking for where broken promises heal" sometimes reads abstract rather than grounded in micro-choice, and Nela's thinness and envelope simile verge on symbolic convenience. Still, the guardian promise altering his tactics ("even if councils called it treason") forecloses a path with visible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rowan's interior life is richly embodied through his relationship with silence and his craft, with micro-choices (taking the wrong turn, touching the fragment to the wound) that reveal hierarchy of values. The trait "quietly persistent" manifests through his hands and breath rather than exposition. Minor weakness: the final epiphany about silence as craft material edges toward articulated wisdom rather than pure dramatization, though it remains anchored in the physical act of repair and singing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her measuring of angles on catalog cards, the way she treats the scarf "like a bookmark for the air" embodies her mindset without therapy-speak. The final choice to guide patrons toward the hidden pocket with "small suggestions" feels earned by her isolation ("loneliness had been a kind of closed system waiting for exchange") and foreclosures a path from pure observation to active curation. Minor slip: the graduate student and old chemist remain purely atmospheric; their presence doesn't pressure Mara's choices. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mina's motivation is visceral and consistent: capturing the dream-absence that fled years ago. Her contradictory impulses—clutching memory versus releasing it—act simultaneously in the final beat when the figure tells her "You wrote me back" and she realizes she must photograph the absence, not the presence. The embodied detail of light "tingling like a lens" on her fingertip and the palette "throbbing like a heartbeat" grounds interiority concretely. Minor slip: the fishermen and widows who weep over the cipher sheets remain functional atmosphere rather than dramatized pressure, and the backstory of the runaway dream is told rather than anchored through a present cue that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's desire to map constellations is anchored early and fear functions as a credible barrier. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("my sense of direction slid sideways") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The closure choice feels more delivered by the locksmith's ritual than earned through the protagonist's internal struggle; the shift from sealed fear to spoken names happens passively. The red ribbon functions as a totemic confidence prop without showing the cost of boldness in a difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lissa's journey from scholar to active seeker is clear, driven by a consistent curiosity that cracks under the weight of lost memories. Her decision to dive, to break her counting habit, and to taste the mushroom reflects agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the fever-night backstory and the boy on the pier arrive as labels without embodied cost on the page. The final restoration feels declared more than earned through visible struggle at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's embodied nervousness (walking backwards) is concretely shown and drives micro-choices; his combative tenderness toward Mara reads as consistent character logic. Mara's arc from pride to vulnerability is earned through on-page action—her shaking fingers, annotations growing steadier—and the final moment where she looks "less like a thief and more like a child who wants to come home" lands with visible cost. Internal contradiction operates throughout (Lio's hatred of the system versus his willingness to mentor; Mara's scorn versus her fear), and the final choice to speak her name is motivated by prior pressure. Minor deduction for occasional label-reliance ("combative tenderness") that edges toward therapy-speak, but the embodiment in gesture and dialogue mostly earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist narrator's creative identity and worry over Nela provide embodied motivation, and the gesture of drawing color at the climax demonstrates agency with visible cost. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("my ideas came out gray, as if my imagination had been frostbitten") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Soren's role as guide is consistent but his interior remains opaque; the relationship pressure is present but not tested by competing choices. The final choice to draw instead of prune feels under-motivated by prior causality—no earlier beat establishes drawing as a viable tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and driven by a clear hierarchy of values—restoring masks, honoring the dead, breaking a family vow—but the motivation shift at "the secret the elders never said aloud" arrives late and feels more asserted than earned through prior contradiction. The ancestor connection reframes stakes, yet the protagonist's emotional progression from hired restorer to family liberator lacks visible micro-choices that demonstrate cost before the final act. Embodied emotion is present ("hands shook," "heart raced") but leans toward stock reactions under pressure. The final renunciation of the family vow carries weight, though the protagonist's internal conflict between duty and compassion could have been dramatized earlier to deepen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lena's interior is well-specified through her framing craft and "guarded kindness," and her choices track through the investigation with consistent curiosity. The trait of interpreting "silence with empathy" governs her final choice to honor the erased rather than treat the vault as exhibit. However, her emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction—she moves smoothly from curiosity to resolution without visible struggle or competing impulse that would raise stakes. The climactic sitting moment ("practiced the craft she used with customers") summarizes rather than dramatizes the renunciation, and the final choice feels prepared rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior is character-particular ("I am, by temperament, quietly analytic, and my grief shows itself as equations"), embodied through diving actions and note-taking. The relationship with "Dee" (Death) supplies pressure but remains abstract; their dialogue exchanges lack embodied tension. The final choice to "let it go" is motivated by accumulated understanding, yet the renunciation feels more conceptual than viscerally costly on the page. Micro-choices during the dive (lifting the snow globe, unwinding the reel) are goal-directed and reflect the narrator's analytic stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interior is concrete and particular—his relationship to the ghost driven by recognized hunger rather than sentiment. His micro-choices (drilling the plate, kneeling to encode, striking sparks) accumulate pressure and reveal hierarchy of values. The final realization that the ghost wants routing, not resurrection, and his soft laugh at having practiced quiet his whole life, earn the closure choice. Minor slip: the ghost's agency occasionally bleeds into Lio's decisions without clear dramatized friction between their wants.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's motivations are clear and rooted in ambition tempered by practiced patience; her choice to read the diary and act on its instructions flows from established traits. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "the old hurt of being seen and still being small," embodying the tension between recognition and advancement. The captain's awareness of her exists only in diary form, limiting relationship pressure, but his trust becomes a constraint that shapes her final stance. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment" toward the captain reads slightly authored rather than earned through prior interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—the promise to memorialize with data, the categorization system that "sounded childish until it worked," the gamble with the telescope. Internal contradiction appears in "quietly explosive in the way she moved, every gesture contained until it had to break," though this reads more as assertion than dramatized simultaneity. The final choice to drop the telescope is earned by prior grief-logic and the established trust in atmospheric memory, with visible cost (risking the instrument Juno used). Minor deduction: the emotional cloud-naming system is told rather than shown constraining an earlier choice before the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's face-blindness anchors her perceptual world; she reads posture, voice, and gesture, and the limit drives her reliance on pattern over portrait. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "the familiar limit of her mind, the blankness where a face should have anchored a memory," then discovers the book offers "another method, one that trusted patterns over portraits." The final choice to seal the book and leave the sky is earned by her acceptance of temporal and cognitive limits. Minor slip: the emotional payoff—"less alone in her defect"—edges toward tidy articulation rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's curiosity is established early and drives micro-choices (greeting the light in six languages, tracing hopscotch patterns), though his interior remains somewhat generic—"diligently curious by habit" reads label-heavy. The light-as-companion moment offers embodied loneliness, but the final paragraph's "felt less lonely because discovery had started to answer back" slips into tell-mode at a pivotal beat. The transformation from isolation to companionship with the luminance has a clear arc, yet the psychological particularity needed to charge the ending fully is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's goal (learn repair rhythm, mend father's clock) is clear and intensifies through her choices at the iced table. The reflection on her father's decline is substantial (~15% of the text) but anchors concretely in the gear assortment and tilts her present decision to craft rather than take. Internal contradiction appears when she chooses three gears despite the warning, then resolves it by making a new gear—this earns the final renunciation. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "saltwood") that reads slightly above a locksmith's natural idiom under stress, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist "I" remains largely undifferentiated from the collective "we," with minimal interiority or embodied emotion. Mara appears briefly as "foreman" but makes no on-page choices that reveal contradiction or cost. Serren's altruism is told through backstory logs rather than dramatized in scene, and the ghost's motivations are explained rather than shown through conflicted action. No character faces a meaningful internal conflict or demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation—to carry a lullaby into the hush—is dramatized through her micro-choices with the clock and puppet head, showing embodied decision-making under pressure. However, her interior life leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("bruised awe," "nested patterns") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation at closure (becoming "a quiet correction, a fraction of time stored in brass") reads as metaphorical assertion rather than a causally earned shift with visible behavioral cost. No secondary character appears to test her stance, leaving relationship pressure absent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's curse-driven motivation is embodied through concrete non-touch mechanics ("pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark") and tested under pressure when rescue tightens the curse. Internal contradiction surfaces in "I should refuse, because every rescue tightens the curse, yet my orchard was planted to mark safe paths, not graves." Micro-choices accumulate—counting turns aloud, assembling the waystone without fingers—revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance ("someone must keep the curse facing outward instead of inward") earns Earned Stasis but skirts diagnostic phrasing; the choice to finish the remaining waystones forecloses solitary endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear—guilt over the bridge failure drives her to atone through both technical innovation and ethical repair. The interior work is concrete and embodied at key moments (tracing foam patterns, placing the chrysalis), though the symphonic-minded trait remains mostly ornamental. The arc from isolation to engagement carries visible cost (patent rights, public testimony), but the chemical epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly without prior struggle over the adhesive problem. Minor slips: her brother's voice in the chrysalis memory feels slightly convenience-placed rather than deeply integrated into her working grief.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior state is richly embodied through concrete actions—counting silences, uncorking moonlight, incising absence—and the "mindfully scattered" trait influences perception and method. However, the central motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") remains abstract until the final reveal, and the climactic recognition that the vendor is reading their own origin feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that test commitment. The shift from blankness to self-knowledge lacks visible internal contradiction or cost; the protagonist moves smoothly toward insight without the friction of competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Safi's synesthetic ability is embodied through concrete choices: wrapping his hands in linen, spitting out fear-laced rainwater, accepting the pavilion's contagion with bare fingertips. Internal contradiction appears when he unwraps his hands despite knowing the cost, driven by his childhood dream to prove pain can be craft. The final choice to hold the weeping soldier and cook the broth carries visible cost—he absorbs and distributes the pavilion's remorse through his body. Minor slip: the Commander's "unspoken dream of mercy" tells rather than shows his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's empathetic decisiveness is demonstrated through concrete action (answering Nine, organizing the repair), but her motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested by internal conflict. The rapid shift from solitary tower work to mobilizing farmers lacks friction—no one meaningfully resists, and her bold multilingual gambit succeeds without visible cost or sacrifice. Interiority is filtered through elevated, abstract diction ("empathetically decisive," "tender, vigorous decision") that feels label-driven rather than embodied under pressure. The ending grants her complete success without forfeiting a path or paying a price that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nira's engineer identity and her goal to "catalogue what the world discarded" are well-established. However, the backstory density (mother's surgery, dream-hiding miner) arrives mostly as told memory rather than lived pressure, limiting on-page choice-making cost. The final sequence—sorting memories via copper helix and synaptic plasticity drills—demonstrates micro-choices under pressure, but the mother reveal and miner subplot feel imported rather than tested. Interiority relies on elevated metaphor ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie") more than contradictory impulse, and the ending stance shift reads as acceptance plus archival mission without a visible forfeiture or relationship friction to ground the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ilya's motivation is clear—he seeks patterns, not treasure—and his micro-choices (scattering seeds, aligning breath with ink shimmer) embody embodied decision-making under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he reenters a place that rearranged his memories, showing simultaneous fear and purpose. The final choice (copying combinations and speaking them aloud) is earned by prior causality, though the cost of extraction remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular throughout, avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's interior is consistently embodied through her tactile listening and hand-based perception; her motivation to create music in silence drives each choice without therapy-speak. The "symphonically minded" trait constrains her method throughout—reading cracks as intervals, conducting without sound. Internal contradiction surfaces in "wondering what messages the past tried to send" versus her present-focused practice, and the final choice to leave the insulator hanging is earned by accumulated tactile experience. Minor: the hedgehog framing device adds symbolic weight but doesn't pressure her choices directly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sable's exile and his refusal to teach cruelty establish clear motivation, and the worry stone provides recurring embodied action. His choices drive the plot through correlation of chess pieces to the nexus's patterns. However, interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("discover beauty in the difficult") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final choice feels more declarative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's pacifist practice motivates his refusal to pry the clasp and drives the resonator solution, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract self-narration ("his peace was not a pose but a practice") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The quarrel with Mara and his catalog obsession are told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final action—reading the diary aloud and swapping crates—shows agency, but the path from tinkerer to crowd intervention feels more expedient than earned by visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jun's motivation—trading skills for a rare seed to brew "serenity within motion"—is concrete and evolves under pressure when Etsu's test forces her to witness decay rather than steal. Her olfactory sensitivity is embodied in the "sulfur and honey tang" and the "clean as crushed fern" thread during the bloom, showing perception under stress. The final shift from "ambition settle into service" is earned by the trial, though the phrasing edges toward abstraction. Minor slip: "tired of healing frantic bodies" tells rather than dramatizes the underlying frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's motivation to find resilience is clear and grounded in economic need (seed rights) layered with curiosity. Her internal contradiction—dismissing superstition then testing it—drives action coherently. The arrow-tip discovery and seedling experiment provide embodied micro-choices that advance her stance. However, the final choice to embed the arrow tip feels more ritual than renunciation with visible cost; she accepts a thesis rather than foreclosing a path through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The investigator's interiority is concrete and professional—measured observations, embodied response to the patch's tactile feedback. Motivation evolves under pressure from procedural inquiry to emergency intervention, with the sprint through the lanes foregrounding embodied choice. Minor weakness: the investigator's blind spots or internal contradictions are minimal; competence dominates without meaningful struggle that compounds before resolution, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's synesthetic perception is vividly particular and consistently embodied ("blues and tasting brass," "copper sunrise"), and the final decision to unfetter the hush through bell-playing flows from established traits. Maera's terror when her breath makes no sound provides a credible pressure moment. However, Lio's motivations remain largely instrumental—serving the Guild's mission—without internal contradiction or personal cost that forecloses a meaningful option. The ending choice feels competent rather than agonized, limiting the felt weight of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's internal contradiction is well-embodied: her fear of the flute versus her drive to understand the pilgrim's loss creates genuine pressure. Her final realization—"guardianship was not the wall, it was the wayfinding, and she had guarded the wrong thing"—feels earned by the threshold-crossing and the encounter. The pilgrim's brief characterization is functional but his role as moral mirror rather than independent actor keeps this from higher bands. Micro-choices (placing markers, steadying breath with the pilgrim) demonstrate hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kestrel's habit of borrowing personalities is established early and drives the central conflict, creating vivid internal contradiction ("borrowed selves crowded, arguing in different tenses"). The final choice to pour borrowed personalities into the paper and return to her own center is earned through prior accumulation. However, the interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("empathy was not a gift but a transformation") that reads more thematic than embodied, and the stranger's emotions swapping lacks specific physical grounding in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rook's jitteriness and need for motion anchor his character trait specifically. His internal contradiction between wanting to coax wonder and feeling Nera's absence creates genuine tension that drives micro-choices—offering the greeting, hesitating at handover, writing the question on the cairn. The final choice to leave the question rather than complete the transactional delivery earns a visible shift in stance. Minor: Mara's interior remains thin, serving more as catalyst than pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—wanting "plain answers" while being drawn into Lio's communion—act in scene and drive the final renunciation of hate toward the car with visible cost (accepting the sister's sealed sorrow). Lio reads as attentive and grounded through micro-choices (placing the prism, breathing on frost, grounding the moment), though his mystic archetype tilts toward archetype without deeper contradiction. The narrator's anger, named and pressed into matter, forecloses the path of simple closure the town demands. Embodied emotion is strong (the prism "trembling," frost crackling, the "shifted hush"), though a few phrases ("eyes stayed soft and exact") lean toward label.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara's motivation to reach Jun is consistently embodied through physical acts (weaving, pressing the amber bead), and her micro-choices—leaving the loom still for three winters, then recommencing—register internal conflict. The final sacrifice (her voice) is causally earned and forecloses speech with visible cost. Minor deduction: Jun's interiority in the penultimate paragraph ("a man had forgotten how to hope") briefly violates single-POV distance, and Yara's contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) are primarily told rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's meek baseline and quiet determination are consistent, and his descent trades memory for knowledge in concrete beats. The memory-loss mechanism shows interior cost ("blank where his mother's name should have been"), but the emotional weight of these losses remains somewhat abstract—we're told he forgets songs and faces without dramatized hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in the moment. The final stance (empty-eyed yet unbowed) reads as earned endurance, though the route there compresses internal conflict into summary more than scene-level contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's sensory-mapping profession shapes perception consistently ("my palms already reading the grit and oil like braille," "my tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere"), and the guilt over Jalen creates coherent internal pressure. The final choice to amend the log is motivated by accumulated cost ("the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled"), though the brother's sudden fury and wire-bound state arrive without prior dramatization of his imprisonment's cause. Interiority remains specific to the trade and the guilt, with embodied sensory detail anchoring emotional states throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Noah's observant restraint is consistently embodied—he reads weight, mood, and unspoken terror without questioning. His micro-choices (carrying crates, writing the anonymous letter, building cairns until his fingers bleed) show a hierarchy of protective instinct over verbal fluency. The final choice to restore the lamp alongside Maris and leave the envelope feels earned by his established pattern. Minor slip: Maris remains thinly sketched; her "quiet courage" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator displays a coherent internal logic—laughter that stirs storms, prophetic speech—with embodied contradictions: joy mixed with the "familiar chill of accident." Motivation for "steering light" is clear and drives key choices (redirecting the beam, creating shadows). However, interiority occasionally trends toward poetic abstraction ("liturgy of angles, salt, and mirth") rather than concrete micro-choices under duress, and the climactic flood-warning sequence lacks visible internal conflict or cost beyond "throat raw," limiting depth at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maru's interiority carries specific embodied details ("new heart thudding politely," "quietly explosive") and her professional lens filters perception consistently. However, the donor-heart premise risks sentimentality and several beats summarize emotional states ("I hated how true it felt") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in action. The final vow feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the progression from watchful observer to active practitioner is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The maintenance worker's interiority is present and drives choices (loosening bolts, following the sound, setting the sextant), but the motivation to "discover what trees witness" reads more as ambient curiosity than urgent need tested under pressure. The progression from grief-measuring to labyrinth-deconstruction feels elliptical; the emotional stakes of this shift remain abstract. Embodied emotion is thin—no contradictory impulses strain the worker in the moment of decision. The final choice to "reset the remaining stones into a smaller labyrinth" lands quietly but the cost (professional risk, reputation, the weight of unprocessed dreams) is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's core motivation (save the realm through weaving) is clear and her gift/wound mechanic (trading memories) creates authentic internal friction. The swaddling choice at the climax demonstrates agency under pressure with visible cost—memories return as payment. However, interiority often operates at high abstraction ("scattered memory keeper," "bound release") without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Marrow and the infants remain functional props rather than pressure sources, and the grandmother's teaching arrives as pure backstory rather than complicating present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin's empathetic trait is consistently embodied through his listening and breath control, and his choice to guide Lysa rather than reject her shows agency under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he "hid behind the folio shelf, not from cowardice but from kindness," though the moment reads more as authorial interpretation than dramatized conflict. The backstory about his sister's death arrives late (~40% mark) and feels imposed to explain rather than complicate present choices. Lysa's panic is told more than shown, reducing the relational pressure that might elevate the final offer.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mina's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—keeping the hardened loaf, tracking incremental erasures, signing the complaint that she later regrets. Her internal contradiction (helpless witness vs. complicit participant) drives the arc toward kneeling in dirt to plant wheat. The confession scene avoids therapy-speak and lands with genuine cost. Sada's "heuristically gentle" voice remains consistent but slightly abstract in early beats; minor register drift when she articulates theme ("altars everywhere...we spend our lives choosing") nudges the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilian's interiority is concrete and distinctly filtered through his archival lens ("measure their decay...by sampling frequencies, counting the tremble"). His micro-choices—accepting the case with both hands, whispering a promise to stabilize the script—embody contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief) that act simultaneously in scene. The sister backstory anchors present emotion without stalling momentum. The final vow to "measure every fading illusion until the last of them learned to mean" is earned by the cumulative pressure of witnessing and personal loss, though the phrasing edges toward elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her steadfastness reading as "habit" rather than courage, the watch-fob trick learned from her father's engine diagnostics. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "comforting unease" and her plan "settling into place" amid danger. The embodied emotions (swallowing frustration, ribs tightening, crawling on her belly) avoid label-speak. Minor slip: her father's moonshine-running backstory and the broader cast (Strake, Lorne, quartermaster) receive minimal pressure-testing on the page, leaving secondary relationships more functional than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The luminous skeptic's interiority shows curiosity and hesitation ("I should have refused, but the taste of the air had already changed"), but motivation relies heavily on backstory about grandmother rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final choice to join the circle arrives quickly after exposition; the protagonist's internal conflict between doubt and longing is told more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in sensory anchors (tongue taste shifts, rib hum), yet the peak decision lacks visible cost—no dramatized foreclosure of an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is rich with sensory memory and her mnemonic gift feels character-specific, but her agency weakens near closure—she "decides to rectify" yet the actual choices blur into a sequence of craft moves that feel more like solving a puzzle than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The final laugh ("softly, to keep the echo from dying again") gestures at transformation but the cost of her choice—abandoning the fairground life versus embracing the "family vocation"—remains abstract rather than embodied. The mother's notebook provides clarity about the past but doesn't force Mara into a live dilemma that charges the ending with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's agency is clear—she chooses to pursue the map, climb to the hatch, write the honest note—and her motivation to find lost conversations (and her brother) is established early. Interiority remains concrete through embodied details (the fern, the zinc fragment in her pocket), and her final choice to confront Lio "with one clean question" forecloses the path of accusation with visible cost. Minor slip: the move from finding the map to deciding to follow it lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or hesitation that would deepen the contradiction between wanting the water and wanting her brother back.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's motivation is clear and her actions are goal-driven throughout, but her interior life remains abstract—we see "muted vigor" and determination without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The Auditor arrives as pure opposition without interior complexity, functioning as a symbolic obstacle rather than a character with his own pressures. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("dimming of color, the slow bleaching of wonder") but these remain conceptual claims rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    N-3's characterization is grounded in concrete choices under pressure—feeding the fear-box contents into a compression vial, walking beside flame with pruning tools, burying the cooled bead. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between caretaker code that balks at fire and the trust in containment over courage. The organic-grain plating flexes like bark, embodying vulnerability, and the static-as-nostalgia conceit registers as specific rather than generic android angst. Slight penalty for the final bedtime instruction feeling more like thematic articulation than earned character knowledge, but it remains plausible as a caretaker's archival reflex.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's observational clarity and patient method come through, but her curator role remains largely decorative—the skill set never constrains a choice under pressure. The courtyard residents show embodied emotion in their confession moments (Hassan's dropped shoulders, the mother's layered fear-love), yet Mara herself operates more as facilitator than agent with her own contradictory impulses. The resolution—clasping the locket—feels too neat, a symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra is defined through occupation and metaphor ("lyrical code breaker," "explained through dance") but these remain mostly decorative labels rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her motives are clear—liberate detainees, encrypt vulnerability—and she makes choices under pressure, but internal conflict is thin; she moves with consistent calm defiance rather than wrestling competing desires. Oren's presence as partner adds relational stakes, yet his role is passive (eyes open but unseeing) until the very end when he mouths the poem. The final choice to leave the journal is purposeful, but the cost feels implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's motivation is concrete and embodied through her lantern-lighting role and the loss of her father's recognition. Her choice to defy the council by exhuming the jars shows agency under pressure, with the wildflowers serving as a tangible anchor for memory. Internal conflict between mercy (the council's story) and grief (her lived experience) drives the escalation. Minor slip: the parasite's mechanics and Lysa's sudden grasp of the council's bargain feel slightly under-motivated in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motive is clear and her choice to filter rather than erase shows genuine moral calculus under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic description ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than embodied contradiction or mistake-prone thought under stress. The final choice—carrying the warning privately—feels somewhat convenient; we don't see her grapple with the cost of becoming the sole keeper of dangerous knowledge in real time. Micro-choices exist but the internal texture remains more lyrical than psychologically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation to learn building-language is embodied through concrete actions (pressing the seal, following stone sentences) and the internal contradiction between preservation duty and tenant collusion creates genuine tension. Ilyas as a character feels specific—his steam-as-script detail and tutoring habits—though his ghostly nature skirts explanation. The final choice to slip documents into the inspector's folder shows agency with visible cost (risk of discovery, shared deception), and the emotional arc from anxious preservation to earned resolution reads credibly without sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's arc from skeptic to workshop-builder shows clear progression, with the shell-handling choice at the Memory Ward forcing her to reweigh attachment versus agency. Interiority is mostly concrete ("do not wait for me, but build your own door"), though the final paragraph's turn to "ghostly resolve" feels slightly label-heavy rather than embodied. The brother's recorded message earns the closure shift, but Mira's internal contradiction—charmed skeptic who still carries the shell nightly—could have acted more visibly in scene rather than being summarized in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's internal contradiction—forger trapped in systemic manipulation yet seeking to complete her father's unfinished sentence—drives the final choice with specificity. The moment she turns the key and confronts the hidden ledger shows agency under pressure. However, the final paragraph's "wisely enduring" label and the formulaic "forgave her father's broken sentence by completing it with mercy" dilute embodied emotion into abstraction at the peak beat. Backstory is extensive but anchored to present stimuli (ledger, thorn, key) and tilts choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her perceptual trait colors choices, but the vast cast (Senn, Jaro, Mael, masked singers, messenger) and rapid character introductions dilute focus. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves efficiently from discovery to confrontation without significant doubt or competing impulses that would test her values under pressure. The ending reunites Senn off-page (he "walks out"), undercutting embodied emotional payoff; the cost of the confrontation is told rather than felt in her body or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—"listened, because she was a wreck-diver and a ghost whisperer" roots motive in profession without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (warming the globe, aligning distortions "the way she aligned testimonies") reflect occupational bias under pressure. The child's ghost is embodied through image-pressure rather than dialogue, avoiding sentimentality. Minor slip: Fen's capture feels efficient but his psychology remains exterior; the crowd's complicity is asserted, not dramatized, slightly flattening the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jiro's motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is embodied through concrete teaching actions and consistent perception filtered through craft. Ren's arc from mockery to reverence is earned through on-page instruction and the smuggler resolution. Internal states remain consistently particular: Jiro's patient attention to "knots that held," Ren's embarrassment and confession. Minor slip: the final bow and tea ceremony risks sentimental closure, but the prior causality supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's observational skill and professional identity are established early and drive several key moves (reassembling letters, reading landscape, recognizing the beacon pattern). Internal motivation is concrete—grief-fueled truth-seeking for Salma—but interiority remains somewhat instrumental; we track tactical choices more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final decision to distribute evidence shows agency with visible cost (Ministry seizure imminent), though the emotional texture of that choice is compressed. Backstory reflection (liquidation context, debunker work) anchors present stakes but occupies substantial word count without always tilting present micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli and Mara both exhibit contradiction and agency: Eli's "variant allegiance" (reason vs. mysticism) drives his choices, and both commit to their final collaboration with visible cost (his solitude, her departure). However, interiority often tilts toward label-speak ("variant allegiance," "lyrically prophetic") rather than embodied conflict, and the secondary dynamic (crowd loyalty) remains abstract. The final renunciation—Mara leaves, Eli remains alone—is dramatized but the emotional progression feels slightly mechanical. Micro-choices at peak moments (rewiring the transmitter, working the puppet rods) are present but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sato's central desire—to become the translator between generations—drives the story's arc from isolation to connection, and his final choice to share the music box and stories shows agency. The interiority is dense with poetic abstraction ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption") that sometimes reads as label rather than embodied emotion, and the micro-choices—setting jars in a semicircle, uncorking them—feel more ritual than psychologically fraught decision. The widow and teenagers function as pressures but remain lightly sketched; their responses (hands shaking, asking questions) are told rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses. The cost at closure—coins become "receipts of belonging"—reconfigures his stake but the emotional price of the shift is asserted more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's "logically emotional" nature is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory action—he calculates tide tables while his throat tightens, but this duality never creates genuine on-page tension or forces a difficult choice. The thieves' motivations shift abruptly: they begin as mercenary traders, then one confesses a buried trauma (brother under ice) without prior seeding, reading as convenient absolution rather than earned pressure. The sonic-absolution moment bypasses real conflict; the thieves simply stop wanting the relic after hearing a tuning fork, and Lio's final act of handing the key back feels like symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Irena's internal arc from impatience to patience is embodied through concrete choices: her initial urge to sabotage versus her vow to watch and wait, her nightly returns to chart shadows rather than act impulsively. The motivation is grounded in "a fault in her blood" and made visible through micro-choices like teaching rebels silent labor and drilling them without snapping. Minor weakness: the rebels' "restrained wildness" and Irena's promise feel slightly asserted rather than fully dramatized in individual faces, and the final return to draw a new horizon risks tidy satisfaction. The embodied tension between wolf-behind-door hunger and patient sculpting carries the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and pressure-driven—counting details as a scientist, fortifying vulnerability with facts—and her choices escalate from observation to evidence collection to transmission. The entangled memories function as embodied contradiction rather than therapeutic insight, showing fear pulsing alongside agency. Minor deduction: Kellan remains functionally one-note (oil-voiced controller), and the worker's death lacks sufficient dramatization to feel like personal stakes for Mara beyond professional duty. The final choice to upload evidence carries visible cost (career jeopardy) and forecloses passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and particular—his doubt about whether Darren's craftsmanship is genuine repentance or parole theater drives the piece forward with embodied hesitation ("his own certainty…began to ache like an old fracture"). The secondary character, Lena, applies immediate pressure by proposing the after-hours repair plan, though her turn feels somewhat convenient. Darren remains largely off-page until the final third, which limits emotional contradiction in scene. Mrs. Halden's climactic response ("That is what action sounds like") lands cleanly but borders on overly articulate thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's curiosity is embodied through specific actions—reading warning labels "for plot," studying the arrow under a loupe, translating the spiral—and her choices cascade toward the ending with clear pressure. Her stance evolves from skeptical to committed without forced epiphany: "irreverent awe tugged her forward, the way a joke can make you kneel if the punchline is the universe." Interior contradiction surfaces when she snorts at destiny yet obeys the algorithm "that sounded like poetry pretending to be math." Minor slip: Jory's final dialogue "So it finally chose you" leans toward convenient revelation rather than dramatized discovery, slightly weakening motivation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's occupation as "corporate memory keeper" and her desire to find deleted files provide coherent motivation, but her internal state remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The final choice to walk into Legal with the patch stitched to her coat carries symbolic weight, yet the contradictory impulses that should attend such a consequential act—fear of retaliation, doubt about the buoy's existence, grief over her mother's disappearance—are asserted rather than dramatized in the moment. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary (the entire investigation unfolds in compressed past-tense retrospection), which flattens the micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her mother's voice in the final clip provides an emotional anchor, but Mara's reaction to hearing it after years of absence is summarized rather than shown, missing an opportunity to embody the contradiction between professional duty and personal wound.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core trait—calmly intuitive—drives her choice to hold silence, use mirrors, and reconstitute the ball, but her interior experience remains thin; we observe her sensing arguments and witnessing fears without contradiction or embodied cost in her own stance. The fisherman's dread and glaciologist's shame are shown via mirror-glimpses rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final assignment of duties feels engineered rather than emergent from Mara's struggle, and no path is visibly foreclosed for her with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature—reality gripped loosely, time folding—is vivid and embodied through concrete micro-choices (the bone tip as probe, hand rising "before I decided"). Internal contradiction shows in the ridiculous study of endings pursued through disaster work, and Signe's presence forces a micro-turn where the narrator's stance shifts from chasing "loud finales" to recognizing weather-like approach. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (stopping the chase), though the interiority occasionally drifts into lyric register that abstracts the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sentinel's interiority shows purposeful control—"not paid to counsel strangers" checks impulse, "gentle persuasion" governs action—and the vineyard metaphor ("harsh hand snaps canes") embodies occupational logic. Mara's motivations are clear (destined mismatches, fear of mistiming), but her inner conflict remains told more than shown; we see her produce the letter and hear her explain rather than watch her waver in micro-choices. The final stance shift (burning as "speaking over" someone) lands cleanly, foreclosing the impulse with modest cost, yet the reflective mode softens contradiction and urgency throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iri's interiority is concrete and embodied: "the slight tightening of guards near the dunes" shows peripheral awareness as practiced skill. Her half-mask functions as visible stigmata and tactical asymmetry ("leaving the other side strangely honest"), and her final choice—offering the prophet ritual risk—grows from contradictory impulses (duty to elders vs. sensed restraint in his tremor). The prophet's confession of doubts and single quiet tear earn his motive without therapy-speak. Minor slip: "She had never learned prophecy, yet she could read a crowd" tells rather than dramatizes the contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's arc from observer to community facilitator reads through her micro-choices (scanning table, placement rules, lighting candles), with embodied calm shown via "letting the scent soften the metallic taste." Internal contradiction emerges when her secret motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is told rather than enacted in conflicted choices; the cost of her labor appears only in the final line's relief. The town's shift from "your loss" to "our hurt" is asserted rather than dramatized through individual struggles. Mr. Gant's single photo contribution and quiet amazement sketch a secondary character under minimal pressure, leaving Mara's isolation and potential failure unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior is consistent and character-specific, showing a scholar's bias toward patterns and margins. The crystal becomes an embodied focal point for attention under pressure. However, key motivations remain stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene—the desire to "decode the pattern" never conflicts meaningfully with another want or fear on the page. The apprentices' choices feel more asserted than earned through prior causality, and Lysa's "weathered innocence" reads as a label rather than a dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is consistently filtered through her recording project and mother's decline, yielding specific sensory choices (the rasp in her throat, chalk hand trembling). Orrin's precognitive forgetfulness operates as a trait that constrains action—he must arrange markers and rely on external clues—but his moments of sudden memory feel more atmospheric than psychologically contradictory. The final choice to add her mother's name is motivated by accumulating longing, though the gesture reads more thematic than agonized. Minor deduction for Orrin's inner life remaining opaque; he functions as catalyst rather than co-protagonist with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior world is embodied through tactile engagement with clockwork and the memory of her father's teaching, and her choices—restructuring the feedback loop, trusting the leaf tick—are driven by consistent expertise and personal stakes tied to Lio's loss. The line "she felt, for one breath, that she had restructured time itself into something that could let loss escape" operates as earned interiority grounded in prior action. Minor slip: the connection to Lio is told in a single retrospective beat rather than woven through earlier micro-choices, slightly weakening the emotional cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's decisively kind approach is embodied in concrete micro-choices—asking without pity, calling Jonah, guiding him through protocol—but her interior remains thin; we see method more than contradiction. Elias's desire for reconciliation is clear and his bodily decline anchors the stakes, yet his emotional progression from bright-eyed hope to final exhale feels summarized rather than layered with contradictory impulses. Jonah's trembling hands and the rain-on-pavement memory offer texture, but his arc compresses six years of estrangement into a single walk without visible internal friction. The final reunion hinges on the record shard as mechanism more than earned character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior contradiction and embodied perception are present—ink-stained fingers, the felt loop in her teeth—but her agency reads more as enacted ritual than forced choice under pressure. The mentor's absence motivates her search yet never becomes a live obstacle she must navigate with visible cost. Her final insight and shadow-binding feel inevitable rather than earned by a renunciation or mistake that foreclosed alternatives. The piece leans on label-work ("quietly deliberate") without dramatizing what Liora sacrifices to complete the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rowan's skepticism cracking into responsibility is well-motivated through concrete details: the familiar bone-setting on the substitute body, Lina's circled mistakes, the changeling's aching jaw. His final choice to step through the hedge door follows causally from accumulating evidence. Minor issue: the girl's appearance feels somewhat convenient, though her physical need (misaligned jaw) grounds the encounter in his professional competence. Internal contradiction between grief-informed doubt and methodical investigation operates consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout—his guilt over the lantern accident is embodied through the scale metaphor and anchored in sensory memory ("the smell of smoke and the sound of people running"). His choices track causally from vow to action: the decision to polish rather than simply take the glass, and the choice to breathe apology into it, show internal conflict manifesting as deliberate micro-choices. The final shift from "punishment into purpose" is earned by prior causality, though the adult child's whispered reaction edges toward convenience resolution. Minor issue: the transformation feels somewhat linear without sustained contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—breathing to warm the amber pendant, translating drip patterns through remembered honey-knowledge—and embodied contradictions appear throughout ("guarding my own trembling with careful breath," Jun's "protected vulnerability"). The choice to give up the pendant shows visible cost tied to prior guilt. Minor slip: therapy-adjacent phrasing ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") appears early but is quickly dramatized through on-page action, limiting harm.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is concrete and character-particular throughout—she is "lucidly watchful despite exhaustion," and her choices (pressing the shell, following the inked path, wading upstream against the current, gathering the cameo-shapes) are motivated by her obsession with "darker courage" and her refusal of the contracted bright ending. The gathered shapes function as micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: she risks "silence" to collect witnesses rather than slide toward the "mouth of light." The final act—writing the baker's stepping-stone path instead of the easy bridge—earns the change through prior causality and forecloses the contracted ending with visible cost. Minor: the cameos (hero-baker, unfinished child, rival reviewer) apply pressure but remain somewhat abstract; embodied contradiction could deepen further in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marn's motivation—restoring the harvest through forgotten song—is signaled early and drives the final actions, but his interiority remains thin; we see him imagine, believe, and smile without embodied contradiction or visible internal cost. The keepers' shame and returning memory create some pressure, but the protagonist's arc feels more like facilitator than transformed agent. The ending choice (handing over the crank) closes a loop without foreclosing a live path or revealing a hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira's motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) drives her actions through the orchard, and the physical demonstration of patience is embodied consistently. The arrival of the cartographer offers a moment of shared purpose, but the stranger remains largely passive—no interior contradiction or competing impulse surfaces. The final choice to copy the intervals feels inevitable rather than costly, and the piece leans on abstract interiority ("she understood") without dramatizing a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ivo's motivation is clearly stated early ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") and his peripheral focus is shown through concrete observation ("scratch beside a keyhole more than the door"). However, his interior experience during the core work remains largely externalized description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to carry the timer out feels like completion of a task rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; he experiences relief but no dramatized internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The weaver's interiority is consistently particular (lamp burner as alignment cue, "fear of empty hands" reveal) and the final choice to "orient properly" each time demonstrates earned agency. The widow's test at dawn adds pressure. However, the stakes remain abstract—the collection task lacks immediate personal cost until the late "fear of empty hands" admission, which arrives close to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"inventory sorrow the way she once counted meat cubes"—and her motivations cohere around practical grief work. The embodied emotion is strong: "silence... pacing like a cat in corners," "pressed the crystals into fresh-cut grooves." Internal contradiction surfaces in "love could be both duty and release," and the final micro-choice to "build hands that open" is earned by the carving process. Minor slip: the phrase "hauntingly practical" edges toward label-speak, but it's dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's chronological confusion is labeled but rarely shown to constrain on-page choices; the "yesterday arrives as a smell" phrasing reads more like ornamental lyricism than a functional impairment. Her motivation to negotiate with her ghost is clear, and the final choice to stop rewriting the night lands with visible cost (she gives up her images, her ambition fades). However, the ghost interaction feels more symbolic than embodied—internal contradiction and embodied emotion are present but not deeply particularized under pressure. The final renunciation earns the closure but doesn't reach the contradictory-impulses-acting-in-scene standard for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lina's motivation to find patterns and her functional creativity are embodied through concrete actions (prying the sextant free, rerouting water). Internal experience is richly rendered through her engineering mindset translating grief and intention into systems, though the final realization about the architect feels slightly expository. The choice to send the beacon is earned by her progression from surveyor to resurrector, with the cost of professional risk implicit in ignoring her supervisor's demolition mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The introverted clock scribe's interiority is specific and embodied—"I spoke to gears more easily than to men," silence as "a wound I kept reopening"—and the final choice to write a score instead of hanging bells shows genuine renunciation with visible cost. Internal contradiction drives the arc: endurance masquerading as holiness versus honest longing. Minor slip: the bear encounter's emotional pivot ("warmth soaked through my robe") edges toward summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure, and the therapeutic framing "silence was not a vow, it was a wound" in the climax risks label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's motivation—understanding deceptive architecture—is consistent and embodied through concrete choices: salvaging evidence, checking the sundial against logs, broadcasting the tape. Her internal experience ("serene upheaval") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the ending choice to expose the myth carries visible cost (stripping comfort from the canal folk). Minor weakness: the bargeman's late confession feels slightly convenient, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("architecture of lies") rather than sharply embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation to preserve ancient methods is consistent and drives his patient observation, yet his internal landscape remains largely externalized through philosophical labels rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to offer the black lotus seed carries conceptual weight but arrives without prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Mara and the weaver function primarily as information conduits; their interiority is absent, and the council clerk's shift feels mechanically triggered by demonstration rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's professional identity as an "obituary writer for the living" grounds the opening, and the queen's grief is embodied through gesture ("fingers curl toward that warmth") and the physical pressure at the narrator's ribs. However, interiority remains thin—the narrator's micro-choices (wrapping the thread, guiding the projection) lack visible internal conflict or cost that would test competing impulses. The ending question ("what I sought in such work") arrives as a prompt-echo rather than an earned revelation from prior dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lorian's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and drives his descent, but interiority leans heavily on decorative metaphor ("trembled in him like an uncalibrated spring") rather than embodied contradiction. The prince's choices—lifting the egg, assembling the nest—are goal-driven, yet his internal conflict remains largely abstract; we see devotion to beauty but no competing fear or cost that complicates the final act. The nun and automata are present but apply minimal relational pressure. Closure choice (keeping the Cradle unguarded) feels asserted rather than earned by prior on-page struggle with a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between familial legacy and redemptive purpose is clearly drawn, with embodied detail in moments like holding the coin and practicing "unyielding compassion." The rescue sequence demonstrates competence under pressure, but the field graft feels technically implausible (skin grafting under fire without anesthesia or sterile conditions) and the sister's one-scream acceptance strains credibility. The final choice to leave the coin at the lagoon is motivated by the copycat discovery, but the shift from fear to compassion happens too smoothly without visible internal friction. Minor backstory density (father's arson, mother's abandonment, burn scar) is anchored in present choices but occasionally tilts toward exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation (childhood illness driving her mission to liberate trapped memories) is established and sustains the quest, but her "luminous skeptic" identity operates largely as a label with texture rather than generating meaningful internal contradiction under pressure. The climactic choice to "carry light back toward the fountains" despite recognizing her mother's protective intent feels enacted rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal competing values. Her "practiced doubt" and "realistically imaginative" traits are invoked frequently but seldom constrain a tactic or force a visible tradeoff in the underground hall.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's motivation is clearly established—exile for wanting "light without using fire"—and his final choice to work with children rather than return to the furnaces shows earned trajectory. The interiority carries distinct texture ("longing had led his mother to the furnaces and his father to silence"), though the generational-pattern meditation occasionally flattens into abstract philosophizing rather than embodied tension. The caretaker automaton's warning crystallizes the stakes, but Lior's response feels more considered than conflicted in the moment. Micro-choices (tightening knots, counting turns) anchor his internal state effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jonas's motivation to understand collective grief is clear and drives his choices—tracing stones, tying ribbons, hosting the final dinner. The spirit mentor offers guidance without undermining agency, and the final act (placing the communal stone) feels earned. However, interiority leans abstract ("fiercely meditative" recurs as a label) and the spectral encounter lacks embodied fear or resistance that would sharpen internal contradiction. The siblings at dinner remain undifferentiated voices, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical action—releasing the escapement, lifting the bob, carrying the weight down to the ridge. Her internal conflict between duty and guilt drives micro-choices (pausing at the crank, keeping the rake handle as evidence) that accumulate visible cost. The widow interaction at the end earns the incremental-absolution arc through renunciation rather than forgiveness. Minor slip: the father/Torren flashback ("she saw, as in searing reverie") edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction, but the choice to recalibrate the marker and show the lead sliver remains grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority shows consistent texture ("joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates") and the final choice to plant the ash sapling is earned by the investigation. However, motivation relies heavily on told abstraction ("I listen for uncharted echoes") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The widow Alvera remains functional but flat, present mainly to deliver exposition rather than apply relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jora is anchored by clear professional competence (mapping ignorance, predictive modeling) and internal contradiction appears in her tension between trusting systems and admitting doubt. Her backstory (father's fatal over-confidence) motivates her present stance via a single anchored block that tilts her choice to list uncertainties in margins. The final "promise to admit doubt and still move forward" reads as declared insight rather than dramatized pressure at the moment of choice. Micro-choices under pressure (setting the paper out, writing conditional sentences, showing margins to the Warden) demonstrate agency, but the peak beat lacks embodied tension—we're told she "let the silence press her into clarity" without witnessing the internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motives are clear and her micro-choices (copying lyrics, cloaking the pages, planning the concert) advance the stakes. However, her internal contradictions remain thin; we see her actions but not the cost of her compliance versus resistance until the concert arrives fully formed. The embodied emotion is sparse—"pricked her like thistles" feels more decorative than visceral. Supporting cast (Vell, Ashmouth) apply pressure but exist primarily as facilitators rather than sources of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is concrete (crystallize recognition for goodbye) and embodied through her ritual actions with ash and charcoal. Her backstory with her father provides clear causal grounding for her present choices. However, the emotional arc remains largely static—she enters wary, performs her work, and exits wary without a visible internal shift or cost that forecloses a path. The inspector's moment of recognition affects him, not her, leaving her agency and transformation unclear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orin's interiority is concrete and particular—his "abrasive calm" manifests in the way he names sediment layers for the lies they support, and the physical detail of the cog fitting his palm anchors his intellectual stance in embodied reality. The internal conflict between "chasing a trinket or a principle" drives his choices under pressure, culminating in the teaching rig decision that forecloses alliance with the Council. Minor dip: the navigator remains an off-stage influence rather than a dramatized relationship crucible, and Mara's refusal lacks the friction of a fully developed secondary character applying immediate counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (recording the choir, asking each singer to name what they can give up, repairing the zither), and her past—unlearning her father's exclusionary lessons—credibly drives her present stakes. The secondary characters (miner, sisters, Niko) apply pressure but remain somewhat interchangeable in their function; their individual arcs are gestured at rather than fully dramatized. The final choice (letting silence sit as verdict) reads as earned renunciation with visible cost—she refuses to plead—but the council's sudden conversion ("even the most practical councilman looked down") feels convenient, undercutting the protagonist's agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is defined by rich sensory gift and steady purpose, but the story compresses her arc—planting, tending, pruning, and distributing fruit—into summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on poetic assertion ("she believed rebellion could be gentle") rather than contradictory impulses colliding in scene. The final choice to prune the tree into "an open canopy" gestures toward cost but the renunciation or trade-off is told, not shown through lost options. Secondary characters (neighbors, clerks) are receivers rather than sources of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maro's involuntary truthfulness trait is established early and drives the tower confrontation, but the internal contradiction could be sharper—his comfort lies at the tollgate feel underdeveloped against the stated desire to preserve wonder. Sela's confession and Maro's brutal honesty create a credible pressure point. The final choice (speaking truth to open the box) is motivated but the embodied cost at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Minor: the "involuntarily truthful" label borders on diagnostic shorthand rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's character is embodied through her perception—"creeping normality noticer," sensitivity to object placement—and her motives are clear throughout. Her final realization ("A house lives when it can recognize itself") is earned through repeated tactile experiences with the orris shard and displaced objects. The inadvertent profundity trait is shown credibly in action rather than told. Minor: some internal beats lean slightly toward label ("the conversations made a gentle heat") rather than fully embodied sensation, but the embodiment in handling objects and the orris shard's physical warmth grounds her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilyan's interiority is concrete and physically grounded—his hesitation, the embodied pressure of telepathy, bubbles stumbling from his mouthpiece. The Founder's "incisively kind" manner is enacted through her question-sharpening technique and the warmth she sends instead of absolution. Internal conflict is present: Ilyan's righteous certainty confronts nested contradictions that open gently until he must welcome nuance. The final choice to "tell them the whole seam" is earned by the cascading revelations, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interior voice is concrete and mathematically colored throughout, with clear micro-choices (pausing at landings, rolling dice, writing equations). Embodied emotion appears in "my throat tightened" and "my hand shook," though some moments lean toward label-speak ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring"). The final renunciation—refusing to imagine a better landing—feels earned by the prior loop of calculation and expectation, foreclosing the climb-for-redemption path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened; the protagonist oscillates between proof-seeking and emotional reckoning without always dramatizing the friction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's insomniac motivation and methodical hope are clearly anchored in concrete action—painting panes, offering tea, proposing the rooftop alphabet—but her internal contradictions remain shallow; the piece tells us she needs proof "for survival" without dramatizing a competing fear or cost that would make her renunciation of sleep feel earned. Ro's grandmother memory arrives as convenient backstory that neatly solves his skepticism rather than complicating it. The final sleep as "trust" reads declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris is embodied through concrete actions (baking, guiding, using the lens) and the motivation to rescue art is shown through choices under pressure. Internal experience shows through her "sweet dread" and the physical handling of objects. However, the displaced persons remain largely passive recipients rather than individuated agents with their own contradictory impulses, and Maris's trajectory from guide to rescuer lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses an option. The captain's conversion at the end feels unmotivated by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orin's grief-driven obsession is embodied through clockmaking craft and specific micro-choices (framing the yoyo, waiting for the stone's hungriest moment). The final renunciation—letting the moment pass unaltered—is earned by his realization that the stone feeds on certainty and his need to force time is fate's true lock. Interior contradiction is visible: he can rewind the day but realizes forcing change perpetuates the trap. Minor deduction: the sister's drowning remains abstract backstory rather than viscerally anchored in present sensation, though the turn itself lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is specific (escape the photographic curse) and the journey through the funhouse carries embodied fear ("old drowning fear pry at my ribs"). However, interiority leans heavily on ornate metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"Fear had learned my outline" reads as poetic assertion more than lived contradiction. The final renunciation (clasp drinks the luminance) feels somewhat mechanical; the cost is conceptual but the protagonist's internal conflict never truly competes with itself on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is consistent and drives his choices under pressure. His embodied actions—tapping joints, climbing the tree, shouting the spar's arc—are concrete and reflect his belief system. Internal conflict is present but thin: he paces and listens, yet we see little contradiction or genuine struggle between competing impulses. The crew's shift from wanting "nets and ropes" to following his rhythm is told rather than dramatized through individual micro-choices, and their interiority remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies organically: curiosity about the watchers drives her search through the city's pattern language. Her micro-choices (testing the whistle, working the seam, composing the gate answer) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is mostly concrete ("question that burns in her throat," "sunwashed dread"), though "quietly driven" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The final choice to step through the gate is earned by her pattern-reading and feels inevitable, with visible cost (leaving Kel Varo, entering the unknown mirrored city).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (repairing the lock, offering the exhibit compromise) reveal character under pressure. Hadrin's arc from protective concealment to admission feels earned by the dramatized exchange. The "emotionally rational" trait is mentioned but not consistently embodied in contradictory impulses; Mara's anger "tightened her throat" yet she remains measured without visible internal friction. The father reference risks instrumentalizing grief but stays within bounds as it tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied through the inkwell and her mother's absence, with clear internal contradiction between professional duty and personal excavation. The interiority occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") that reads more poetic than character-particular under pressure. Beran's confrontation creates genuine stakes, and Lira's physical choices (wrestling the beam, shoving his skiff) reveal her hierarchy of values. The final cost—returning with the inkwell and marking stones that will preserve her hidden words—earns the stance crystallization, though the mother's vanishing remains more told than dramatically constrained on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve"), with embodied perception under stress. The final choice to photograph evidence and leave the stamp carries visible cost (personal risk, isolation). Minor weakness: the internal arc relies on maintained calm rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, and the trait "tranquilly perceptive" functions more as label than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is concrete (finding Jalen's shadow via dream recording) and drives her through escalating choices. The craft details (lantern making, gem polishing, origami) anchor her specificity, though interiority remains functional rather than contradictory—she grieves, resolves, acts, without simultaneous competing impulses wrestling in scene. The final transformation into shadow-bird and tear feels earned by the journey but略 anticipated rather than wrestled from ambivalence. Minor voice-convergence between narration and the priests' explanation flattens what could be Mira's unique perceptual filter under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is vivid and particular—the geode as both calibration tool and memorial, the embodied "unfiltered awakening" driving sensor-like perception. However, the decisive final choice ("I fed the pool into the guidance net, forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy") arrives without dramatized cost or visible obstacle overcome in the moment; the act reads more as wish-fulfillment than earned agency under pressure. Interiority is dense and voice-specific, but the climactic move lacks contradictory impulses or trade-offs that would show genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's "perpetually surprised face" and the pilgrim's tired quest both show internal states through external markers. The pilgrim's motivation—"to decode the frequency of belonging"—feels abstract and label-like, particularly in the explanation about radios hissing; his smile and laugh at the end are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Mara's micro-choices (launching the drone, climbing to the notch, fitting the chips) are goal-driven and the ending choice to share this "family" has cost, though the emotional specificity remains somewhat muted. No major causality breaks, but interiority occasionally leans on stock phrasing ("itch of missing pieces," "bloom again, sharp as frost").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's guilt and profession shape her arc, and the final choice to speak truth rather than deliver false memories shows earned transformation. Internal conflict between practiced erasure and confession drives the climax. However, the interiority often operates at high register ("sieved hush," "tempered regret") rather than embodied contradiction, and Jonah remains more recipient than pressure source—his dream of "faint ticking" and his choice to reject the capsule feel convenient rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interior work is strong: the drawer pull anchors a specific history of living "between apology and forgiveness," and her thoughtfulness manifests in concrete choices—leveraging brass to free wire, extending the object as proof of repair. Her motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" drives the exchange beats. Minor weakness: Sarin and Vek remain functional pressures rather than fully individuated presences; their contrition feels gestural at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theo's internal contradiction between shame and the impulse toward repair is dramatized through embodied choices—polishing the compass, speaking to gulls, choosing inland water over open sea. The mentor's voice and the crewman's ghost drive micro-decisions with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("backlash of regrets," "thin strand of faith") that slightly softens peak pressure. The final museum action earns the shift from hiding to steering through accumulated micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy where none remains" is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The choice to haul up the teenage thief shows micro-decision work, and refusing the stolen wallet demonstrates value hierarchy under pressure, but the interior voice relies heavily on philosophical summary ("Wonder survived in me like a bruise you keep pressing") rather than embodied contradiction. The final testimony choice feels more thematically required than earned by visible internal struggle on the page. The reflection-heavy mode keeps interiority at arm's length from visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's grief-driven motivation is embodied through scarred hands and steady paradox, and her willingness to transform shows contradictory impulses. The final choice to become a silver-limned hound is earned by causal build-up and forecloses her human identity with visible cost. However, Sable remains more symbol than pressuring presence—his patient gold eyes and not-quite-smoke outline are described but he exerts no dramatized resistance or complication until the corridor offer. Internal conflict is declared ("every part of her resists") rather than shown through micro-choices that layer want against fear in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and embodied ("the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat"), with contradictory impulses driving toward the closure choice. The decision to relive the stolen hours rather than simply reclaim them demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction: the mother's interior voice occasionally slips into elevated register ("cloudbound repentance") that feels slightly above the exhausted postpartum state, though this reads as stylistic choice rather than failure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's arc from self-contained archivist to vulnerability is earned through concrete micro-choices: refusing weapons, stitching photos, admitting fear to Lio, and naming her cruelties at the hatch. Her motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, though the pacifism/"end the chain" explanation reads slightly over-articulated for the moment. Embodied emotion is strong—floating when happy, gripping handrails—and the shadow work beats ground interiority in tactile action. The ending choice flows from established causality with visible cost (confronting envy, cruelty, love), meeting the 9+ test, but minor therapy-speak ("shadow work," "forgive herself") in reflective beats nudges the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amina's philanthropist identity and her coincidence-orchestration trait are signaled early, but the interior texture remains abstract—we're told she "listened for the right hush" rather than shown the micro-choice mechanics that govern her gift-giving. The cave choice (ignoring the "sensible plan") reads as impulse without visible internal contradiction or foreclosed cost until retrospective framing. Toma's shift from suspicious to curious happens via "simple gift" rather than earned pressure, and the ending pivot to "gathering stranded villagers" introduces agency off-page that the prior beats did not dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is present and inventive traits surface in action ("I took it not as a threat but as a curtain"), but internal contradiction is minimal—the protagonist moves through elaborate intrigue without genuine doubt or competing impulses. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "throat warmed with a private laugh" is one of few physical anchors in a sea of declarative control. The final choice to open locks feels mechanically inevitable rather than earned through visible psychological cost, and the narrator's competence goes untested by meaningful error or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eren's precognitive curse and his relationship with Lysa's memory establish clear, consistent motivation anchored in the promise. His micro-choices—deciding which rocks to shift when he sees futures—are embodied and dramatized. The final decision to stay and teach rather than run is earned by the sequence where Lysa's rocks spell "Forgive." Interior contradictions are present (guilt vs. duty) but his embodied struggle could be sharper; the dust-and-stone mechanics sometimes distance us from his immediate physical experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior voice remains specific and embodied throughout—"my anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil" anchors contradiction in image rather than therapy-speak. The backstory revelation (father's confession) shifts the narrator's stance with visible cost, allowing rage and understanding to coexist without resolution. Micro-choices (loading plates, stopping the timer at breath stutters) reflect a hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor weakness: Lysa's motives remain functional but underdeveloped; she facilitates rather than applies independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysander's core trait—"diplomatically fierce"—is embodied through his actions (soft words, hard argument-driving, measured dueling), and his mechanical arm provides specific embodied detail. However, his motivation to "turn questions into destinations" remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized through internal conflict. The duel showcases tactical intelligence, yet emotional progression is limited; he moves through high-stakes combat without contradictory impulses or visible psychological cost, reading more as competent execution than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Len's personality-shifting trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it's decorative. Interior access remains thin throughout; we see poetic observation but minimal embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Mara exists largely in summary; their friendship is told rather than dramatized in scene. The ending gesture (planting, passing the tin) feels motivated by premise rather than earned internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and character-particular, driven by clear motives (repair what is broken, surprise fate). The internal contradiction between holding on and letting go operates consistently through scene work, culminating in an earned choice to play goodbye. Embodied emotion is present (hands on piano, carrying the clock), though some moments lean toward atmospheric summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost and feels motivated by prior causality.

    Tavo's interior life shows some contradictory impulses—empirical doubt versus willingness to engage dream logic—but these remain somewhat abstract. The micro-choices (kneeling, reading aloud, planting with specific jar order) demonstrate his ritual process, yet the moment when he "answers with the only tool a reality checker trusted, a question" feels more like authorial declaration than embodied discovery. The shift from skeptic to participant is traced but not fully earned through on-page struggle; his embodied doubt never quite crystallizes into a decisive trade-off that forecloses a prior stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and the compass's needle as a concrete marker of emotional state creates embodied interiority. Internal contradiction appears in the realization "the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence," earning the shift. However, the final pruning moment risks an unearned epiphany—the leap from one brittle twig to diffused anger reads schematic rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. The father remains an abstraction; Sera observes but never pressures a decision that costs the protagonist something on the page beyond symbolic gesture.

The final choice to call Mara is a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) that forecloses easy forgiveness, motivated by the discovered note and the burden of the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)

His empathy is occasionally told ("keenly empathetic mind") rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices, but his final stance (staying while leaving) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in sustained solitude.

    Miriam's characterization is deeply embodied and practical under grief, with micro-choices like carving the circle revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation—harvesting lessons instead of letting loss rot—is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the bittersweet tea. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's contradictory impulses are shown in scene: her eroded ambition vs. her precise scavenging, her desire to outrun loss vs. her acceptance of small repairs. The final renunciation (giving up her images, accepting the role of tender of repairs) is earned by the costly negotiation with her ghost and is embodied in the concrete act of fixing the bolt. Her chronological confusion is a flaw that drives the story's method and shapes her perception, not a label.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lina's curiosity and functional creativity are embodied through specific micro-choices under pressure, such as pocketing the sextant and rerouting water; her stoic endurance and final understanding earn the closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio's motivation is clear and consistent, driving every key turn. Interiority is concrete and embodied through observation and patient action, though internal contradiction is minimal. His final choice to place the seed and accept the rope is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weavers relinquishing secrecy. The score is capped slightly by the lack of deep internal conflict or flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction (professional detachment versus empathetic immersion) and the queen’s embodied grief are rendered through concrete, character-particular micro-choices (allowing the sleeve brush, curling fingers toward warmth). The final renunciation—turning absence into a map—is earned by the causal progression of the projection scene, with visible cost in the narrator’s stuttering breath and the queen's intimate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prince Lorian's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "trembled like an uncalibrated spring"). His final choice to keep the Cradle unguarded is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the bittersweet requiem for what was lost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistently drives high-stakes choices; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., going back into the fire, performing the graft) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (leaving the coin) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, and contradictory impulses—fear of inheritance versus compassion—act simultaneously in scene. Hairline slip: minor thematic echo in "practiced unyielding compassion," but it is anchored in action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. luminous imagination) is embodied in concrete micro-choices; her final decision to return memories is earned by prior causality and personal loss, with visible cost in the ache of remembering and the revelation about her mother.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior's interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, with contradictions (longing vs. fear of repetition) driving micro-choices. His final renunciation—teaching on the outskirts—is earned by the automaton's warning and his inherited wound, with visible cost (exile loosens but he does not return home). The automaton provides secondary pressure, but Lior's motivation and flaw-driven struggle remain the clear, consistent core.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Jonas's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("his mind, fiercely meditative, moved slow and deep, as if carving air"), and his motivation (to discover the shape of collective grief) compels higher-stakes choices. His final act—setting the stone and feeling the spirit let go—is an earned renunciation/change with visible cost. Minor deduction for moments where emotion tilts toward abstract conceptualization (e.g., "grief might be measured in meter and breath") rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's guilt and ethical diligence are embodied in concrete actions and micro-choices; her final acceptance of incremental absolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the painful easing of her ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gardener is vividly drawn with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, though contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Jora's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., "numbers that felt like bones warmed in her pocket") and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action—writing conditional sentences—is earned by prior causality and her memory of the Black Winter, showing visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from discovery to rebellion. Her internal drive (“teach dust to tell stories”) is embodied in concrete micro-choices (copying, stitching, cloaking). However, her emotional range remains mostly steadfast; contradictory impulses under pressure are not deeply explored, limiting the characterization's complexity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma; her internal conflict between fear and duty is embodied in micro-choices like lifting the mask. The final endurance is earned by her backstory and the crystallized emotion in the inspector's face.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orin's interior contradiction (dread vs. longing) and micro-choices under pressure earn the final renunciation; cost is legible when he rejects the meal ticket and builds the teaching rig in the damp dark.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a history of unlearning hatred, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and contradictory (e.g., "expectantly resigned"), and her final choice—to let the quiet sit as a verdict—is an earned, meaningful endurance. Micro-choices like recording the chaos and asking singers to "give up" a sound reveal her values and tactical intelligence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's characterization is concrete and consistent; her ability to taste memories drives micro-choices (pruning for specific memories) and her final act of shaping the canopy is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "informally wise," but interior contradiction is shown through her selective pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maro’s involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices, with embodied interiority and a credible final revelation earned by prior causality. Sela provides secondary pressure, and their status shift under pressure is legible. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices reveal values under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" is concrete and drives her choices; her interiority is specific, and her final renunciation of the shard is earned with visible cost. The micro-choice of moving the clock tests her theory, revealing her values under pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilyan's interior contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are concrete; his final choice to "welcome nuance" is earned by cascading revelations with visible cost. The Founder's telepathic presence is incisively kind, sharpening questions that cut through certainty, though her characterization remains somewhat monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character's grim optimism is concretely embodied through sore calves and notebook; interior contradiction between hope and acceptance plays out in scene; final renunciation to sit and carry the softened texture is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the machine's slowing and the staircase's widening.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's interiority and methodical hope are concrete and drive her choices; Ro's revealed memory and emotional response create a credible crucible. Their final collaboration is earned by prior causality, with the cost of shared vulnerability legible. Slight abstraction in describing emotional hinges ("that hurt was the hinge") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "stomach twist with a sweet dread").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orin's grief and inventive nature are concretely embodied; his final renunciation is earned by the stone's question and his realization about certainty, with visible cost in letting the moment pass.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete ("lungs tasted of pennywater and dust"). Final choice to use the clasp is earned by prior causality and the dictionary's paradoxical logic. A slight deduction because the emotional embodiment peaks early; the climax beat is more conceptual than viscerally contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Leeward’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving every tactical choice under pressure. His interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., holding the mallet “like a talisman,” reading clouds), and his micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The crew’s conversion from skepticism to participation is a credible relationship shift under pressure, though Leeward’s internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira's motivation ("quietly driven" by a question) is clear and rooted in her cartographer's lens, compelling her investigation. Her interiority is concrete and embodied in her professional attention (e.g., reading shells as pages, testing pitch). The final choice to step through is earned by her methodical pattern-solving. A slight deduction as her internal contradictions under pressure are more implied than dramatized in-scene; the final realization ("sunwashed dread") is powerful but could be more deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and personal history; her "emotionally rational" trait is embodied in her measured confrontation and final bargain. The final choice—offering a curated exhibit—is earned by prior causality and her father's story, with visible cost in the bare rosebush and cold wind. Hadrin's admission adds depth, avoiding a one-note antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Maren's logical, tranquil perceptiveness is embodied in concrete micro-choices under pressure, and her final renunciation—leaving the stamp to carry only images—is earned by prior causality with visible risk. Interiority avoids stock phrasing; her "dappled resolve" and fear of the council show flawed, credible endurance. The trait-driven investigation anchors every turn, and the closure cost is legible in her cautious swim out.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and grief is embodied in concrete actions like folding dead cranes, but internal contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene; final choice to split herself is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's trauma and "unfiltered awakening" are embodied in concrete actions and perceptions, driving his hunt with palpable cost. His contradictory stance—working for the agencies that caused his loss while seeking to subvert them—adds depth. The final choice to feed the pool into the guidance net is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the door he cannot step through). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's sharp-eyed observation and the pilgrim's quest are concretely embodied; micro-choices under pressure (drone launch, masonry pull) reveal hierarchy of values. The final alignment feels earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than deep.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara's guilt, profession, and withheld truth create a coherent, contradictory interiority that drives micro-choices under pressure. Her final confession is a credible renunciation earned by the discovered driftwood carving, with visible cost in the "shared" quiet. Jonah's presence as secondary pressure forces her stance crystallization without flattening her complexity. The only minor hairline slip is a slight diagnostic lean in "tempered regret," but it is anchored in embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her history; her interiority is concrete, and her final choice to give the drawer pull is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the apologies and shifts in Sarin and Vek. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her living in the gap between apology and forgiveness informing her listening. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and relationships as crucible force stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theo's characterization is deeply embodied with consistent flaws and contradictions; his final choice to write the apology is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he steps into the museum, aligning heart and action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.4)
    Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory; micro-choices under pressure (saving thief, refusing wallet) reveal evolving motivation. Final decision to testify is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mira's motivation is crystal clear and intensifies under pressure, with contradictions (steady grief) acting simultaneously. Her final choice to transform is earned by the prior causality of her longing and the cost of shedding her human body, rendered in embodied, character-specific terms.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict and embodied emotion are vivid; her final choice to relive lost time is earned and costs her comfort, aligning with her role as a mother and cartomancer.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's pacifism and guilt are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices; her final forgiveness and step into the new dimension are earned by prior shadow work with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Amina's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The final realization is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle. The relationship with Toma shifts from suspicion to wonder, serving as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Protagonist is vividly characterized through concrete interiority and micro-choices, with a clear, consistent motive driving the plot. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle undercuts depth, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eren's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in guilt and a promise, driving his actions and final choice. His precognitive curse provides compelling internal contradiction and shapes his micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (to stay and teach) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Some interior emotion leans toward summary at peaks, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with contradictory impulses (anger/gratitude) acting simultaneously. Final choice to use "measured light" is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the half-caught star and the father's confession. Emotions are embodied (e.g., "anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil, like rain that falls straight down"). Micro-choices under pressure (loading plates, stopping the timer at breath stutters) reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lysander's "diplomatically fierce" temperament is embodied in micro-choices (using the needle card, stepping onto the duel strip) and his final decision to have Veller walk the route, which is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The mechanical arm is not just a trait but a tactical shield. Interiority is concrete though not deeply contradictory, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Len's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure that reveal his vow to forge beauty from anarchy. His personality shifts and relationship with Mara act as a crucible, culminating in an earned understanding at closure. No diagnostic label-speak; motives clear and intensified by riots and lockdown.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and embodied; his steely longing and strategic creativity drive micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses of holding on versus letting go act in scene, and his final decision to play the goodbye chord is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary; the change from longing to strength is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tavo's interior contradiction (empirical doubt vs. measured pattern) drives the scene; his final choice to plant the seed and surrender certainty is earned by the dream interpretation and prior causality, with visible cost in "felt it leave him like a surrendered certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Protagonist's interiority is concrete and conflicted; micro-choices under pressure reveal values; final pruning action earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivations (escape from drama into measurement, loyalty to Lupe, grief over lost telescope time) are specific and consistently dramatized through choices, not just told. Her “preprocessing” mindset colliding with the messy greenhouse yields real internal friction, especially when she resists naming the spiral “like a formula.” The shift in what she chooses to keep (accepting “slight irregularities” instead of discarding noisy data) is a credible, costed change. Lupe is sketched efficiently yet distinctly, adding relational pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivations are clear, rooted in both professional pride and a deepening moral courage, and her choice to investigate rather than hide feels earned by “steadily adaptive” being shown in action. Interiority is specific and sensory (reading frost, hearing resonance) rather than abstract, and her mixed reactions—injury, wounded pride about the copied glass, fear, and resolve—coexist credibly. The final stance shift toward endurance and “pauses” grows naturally from earlier micro-choices. A slight neatness in her articulated realization at the end keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orren and Mara are sharply etched through behavior and small, telling choices—his hands “speaking,” her throat-touch gesture, his sailorly way of “trimming” the algorithm. Orren’s motivation (to work with rhythm he still feels in his bones) is consistent and drives his decisions, and his realization about the empty slot reconfigures his relationship to loss. The internal contradiction—trauma from the storm vs. choosing to relive it as calibration material—is present but could be pushed a bit further on the page. Still, for this length, the characterization feels specific, embodied, and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marek’s vocation, weariness, and stubborn sense of duty are sharply realized and drive his every choice, from not discarding the lens to enduring physical pain to finish the work. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“the kind who keeps walking long after the funeral is over because the road still holds footsteps”). The internal conflict—his impulse to throw the lens away versus his compulsion to answer the dead—is present, though it could be surfaced in one or two sharper, in-the-moment hesitations. The final endurance choice feels fully earned and carries a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amira’s motivation—to keep her exile community fed and dignified under sanctions—is clear and consistent, and her tactics evolve believably as pressure rises. Her gentleness and stubbornness are shown through actions (the bell, the anonymous box, the pairing of youths with elders) rather than labels. However, interior contradiction is mostly implied (safety vs visibility) rather than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or misstep. Sami and the officer function well as pressures but remain lightly sketched, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s inner conflict—unused love knotted behind the sternum, regret over the soldier, pride versus release—is specific, embodied, and drives every choice, especially the decision to “bless” his leaving. The pilgrim of sparks functions as a sharp external pressure rather than a vague guru, and his questions/requests expose her motives without therapy-speak. The final loosening of the knot and her altered relationship to her art feel earned by everything that precedes it. A hair shy of top-tier only because the soldier himself and the prior life remain purely emblematic, limiting the complexity of her guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, curiosity about the “texture of time,” and ethical responsiveness to the trapped woman are all clear and consistent, and their decisions (entering the maze, accepting the cost of letting the photos fade) feel motivated. Interiority is vivid if slightly more conceptual than conflicted; we don’t see sharp contradictory impulses so much as an almost serene acceptance of the task’s demands. Lio and the woman function more as charged figures than fully individuated characters, but they do apply real pressure on the narrator’s choices. The final renunciation (burying the fragment, accepting “now”) feels earned by the prior build.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are crystal-clear, and her choices (leaving the chain on, prioritizing misdirection over speed, letting the boy hold the chain) reveal a distinct, principled character. However, interior contradiction is minimal: she feels more like an emblematic figure than a fully conflicted person under pressure. Embodied emotional beats (the chained wrist “trembling yet steady”) work well but are sparse. The closing moment with the boy hints at richer complexity that the story doesn’t fully explore.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to locate the exact “sound” of her brother’s betrayal—is specific, consistent, and drives every major choice, from diving for absences to risking giving Rell the prototype. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (color-sound synesthesia, the “thud” of Jory’s laugh) and she holds contradictory impulses: desire for proof vs. the need to forge something new from pain. Rell is sketched efficiently but with enough texture (his “yellowish sweetness,” flinch, and eventual confession) to function as a live pressure rather than a prop. The closing choice—to record, report, and continue forging aids rather than indulge revenge—feels earned and carries clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s motive structure (stealing light to reveal choice, obsession with the door) is specific and consistent, and his final renunciation is cleanly earned by what we’ve seen of his craft and curiosity. The relationship with “you” is sketched efficiently yet still feels like a real crucible for his decision at the door. Emotional experience is mostly embedded in image and action rather than label, which works, though his internal conflict at the climax could use a hair more embodied, character-particular texture. Nema functions well as a pressure-bearing secondary, not just a set-dresser.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s guilt, wonder, and pragmatic idealism are finely intertwined; her past abandonment and present return feel deeply motivated and consistent. The bookmark and theatrical narration both reveal how she manages shame and fear. Internal contradiction (obedience vs inquiry, fear vs wonder) is dramatized rather than told. The only limit is that her present-tense choice never faces a concrete opposing force on the page, so her change is more reflective than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s fear, adaptiveness, and dawning rage are specific and embodied, especially in beats like “learning new ways to hide my shaking in plain sight” and letting the boy see her tears. The tension between her phobias and her job reads as a genuine internal conflict that informs every choice. Vaughn and the boy are sketched economically yet clearly in terms of power and vulnerability. The final decision to walk in “trembling and certain” feels well-earned by the prior psychological groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s obsessive cartographic drive is specific, embodied (“hands shook not from cold but from a mildly obsessed hunger”) and remains consistent as it’s reoriented from light to darkness. Lyr is sharply drawn through her method (pebble bowl, command to “retell…using only what the ruined gold did not say”), and the relationship is a true crucible that forces the narrator’s shift. The final stance—accepting the destruction of the booklet and mapping by silence—feels earned and carries a conceptual cost. Internal contradiction (clinging to tools vs. surrendering them) is present but could surface a bit more explicitly under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    J-17’s blend of dutiful composure and furtive curiosity is sharply realized, and its micro-choices—picking up the violin, choosing to loop, then to stop—track cleanly from those traits. The internal conflict between using the violin as a tool for understanding and preserving it from further damage is subtle but legible. Emotional experience is deftly translated into machine-appropriate terms (“registered something like longing,” “called the process to amalgamate”), which keeps the character particular rather than generic SF-robot. If anything, a slightly clearer moment of felt cost at the renunciation (beyond the conceptual) would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and textured—her secretive archiving of tickets, her fear-rooted decision to hide the lens, and the later pivot to radical transparency all feel earned. The contradiction between protecting Eli and enabling suspicion is dramatized rather than stated. Eli is sketched through decisive gestures (the doodle, the watchfulness) that convey a relationship under strain despite minimal page time. The only softness is how quickly everyone, including the board, seems ready to thaw once she acts, slightly reducing the felt cost of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is sharply drawn through concrete habits (saving string, reusing nails) and a specific moral history, with his shame over the blight deception credibly driving his present need for a stricter, more embodied form of atonement. His internal contradiction—pragmatic skeptic who still invests in ritual—plays out on the page in his elaborate yet “non-magical” ceremonies. The confession to the hedges feels earned by that history and carries visible cost in vulnerability rather than a neat absolution. Mera is thinner but functions cleanly as pressure and witness without muddying his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s characterization as the “obliging sky mechanic” with a pragmatic, non-philosophical mindset is vivid and consistent, and her priorities (station safety over grand theory) clearly drive her choices. Sen’s intellectual hunger is sharply sketched in a few lines and creates a legible status dynamic. The final reframing—Mara insisting on responsibility—feels earned, though her internal conflict never bites quite as hard as it could (she is never seriously tempted by the power of the nexus). The emotional embodiment leans more toward conceptual than visceral, but remains specific and character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation—to respond to Varga’s code and resurrect the house’s music—is clear, consistent, and tightly linked to her profession and temperament. Her reverence for silence and the ghost gives her a distinct interiority, though her inner life leans more toward single-minded devotion than contradictory impulses. Micro-choices (tapping instead of bowing, waiting at the keyhole, bowing to the empty room) effectively reveal her values under pressure. The main limitation is a lack of more overt internal conflict or flaw that would complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and specific—the swallowed-truth metaphor, the lie about the wind, and the bodily sense of weight give the narrator sharp, embodied guilt, and Mara’s “fault tolerant” temperament comes through in how she listens for mistakes and smudges the notebook. The relationship stakes with Eli are tightly bound to that guilt and credibly reconfigure once he’s found alive but furious. The final choice to confess as a “weather report that included my own distortion” feels earned by prior characterization, with visible cost in loneliness and risk to the relationship. If anything, Eli’s shift from off-page absence to on-page confrontation is slightly compressed, softening some potential messiness of that reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s mix of “reckless abandoned-mill explorer” and “religiously skeptical” appraiser yields a distinctive, consistent psychology that cleanly motivates every choice, especially going alone at midnight and refusing to “forgive” Mara at the end. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“I appraised the scene like a salvage lot”), with embodied perception of cold, grease, and fatigue. The internal conflict between curiosity, ethical discomfort, and resistance to being anyone’s absolution is legible in the final decision to carry the truth out rather than seal it away. The only limitation is that Mara remains off-page, so the relationship’s emotional cost is implied more than directly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s worldview—loose grip on reality, vow of nonjudging witness—is lucid, specific, and consistently dramatized in choices like going to the refuge “not to rescue it, only to observe.” Internal contradiction is present but muted: they feel grief at collapse yet choose to frame it as script, which reads more as serene acceptance than active struggle. The other keeper is sketched efficiently as a mirror/foil but remains largely thematic rather than fully human. The final endurance choice (to keep witnessing without ownership) feels credible and earned, but the emotional cost is understated rather than sharply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are convincingly layered: professional restraint vs. longing to help, belief in “ordinary magic” vs. fear of retraumatizing a child. Her choices (not forcing songs, proposing the eclipse trip, revealing the curl) all feel grounded in that psychology. Mara’s silence and micro-responses (touching the locket, humming before speaking) are specific and credible. The only slight limit is that Liora’s own flaw or blind spot is handled gently; the piece keeps her relatively idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa is sharply etched through concrete, idiosyncratic details (tin eartrumpets, bone-handled chisel, feeling vibrations as sentences) and a clear, consistent motivation. Her choices—following the draft, opening the hearth, deciding to catalog rather than "set the axis back"—all arise organically from that characterization. The piece is more about endurance than transformation, but the quiet renunciation of an impossible task is earned. A touch more explicit tension between her sensitivity and the emotional cost of what she uncovers could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lian’s motives and contradictions (profit vs unease, prophecy as power vs curse) are clear and drive her choices, and Mara’s pragmatism offers a strong counter-stance. Her key decisions—going to the island, weaponizing then rejecting her gift—feel earned. However, the peak beats (shoving the courier into the cleft, altering the beam) are rendered with relatively cool abstraction, with limited embodied fear or hesitation on the page. A touch more moment-by-moment interior friction under stress would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Selo’s motivations and methods are sharply defined and stay consistent under pressure, and Mara’s shift from conquest to neighborliness is credibly earned through the rhetorical exorcism. The lack of direct interiority is offset by charged physical details (her “unraveled stillness,” the shiver afterward) and the specificity of their choices. The relationship is clear: Selo exerts soft authority while still allowing Mara final agency with the blue circle. Emotional contradiction is present but could be deepened slightly in Mara at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (chronological homesickness and the desire to “conduct unheard symphonies”) is vivid, specific, and consistently drives her choices, from saving fortune slips to building the memory-map and climbing to the crown. Interiority is rich and embodied through details like the mother’s coffee, the school bell, and the nautilus warming “like a small living ear.” The final shift—fear of time easing into a vocation of seeding futures—is earned and legible as an internal change with cost. The only slight limitation is that contradictory impulses under pressure (urge to return vs. to move forward) could surface a bit more directly in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysa’s flaw—literally defying gravity and metaphorically dodging emotional weight—is clear and drives her choices, especially her history of “drift[ing] away from people the moment they expected weight and commitment.” The interiority is specific to her occupation and gift, and her final choice to “let gravity have her” is earned by the preceding pattern of avoidance. Some abstractions like “labyrinth of self” are more told than embodied, slightly softening the visceral feel of her conflict. Overall, she reads as particular, coherent, and credibly changed by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific—a deaf teacher who “read[s] music in faces and floors” and recognizes silence as having weight—and her competence informs the tactics she chooses in the cavern. Her motivation to counter numbness is clear, and her actions consistently arise from that sensitivity to vibration and emotional absence. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or inner cost at the climax; she solves the problem without much visible internal struggle or moral friction. The relationship with Kerrin functions more as collaboration than a pressured crucible, which keeps emotional complexity just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivations (integrity, curiosity, loyalty to Mara) are clear and consistently drive choices, and the professional lens of a “meticulous storm recorder” gives them a distinct interior texture. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my breathing sounded like a barometer ticking”), and external behavior (calm, lateral movement) often undercuts the danger they know they’re in. The main limitation is a relative smoothness in emotional contradiction under peak pressure—the rescue and escape unfold with impressive competence but minimal visible fraying or irrationality. The relationship with Mara is sketched effectively but could bear more relational friction to feel fully crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s motivation and contradictions are rich and specific: a man who commodifies nostalgia yet avoids his own grief, brought back to the site of his core wound. His aromatically cautious habits, avoidance of the Conservatory, and relationship with his mother’s memory all play into the final choice to open the vial and then stay as steward. The internal turn from shame and avoidance to acceptance and caretaking feels earned by the preceding causal beats. Dr. Vann is thinner but functional as a pressure-bearing secondary; the core emotional weight stays firmly with Lio.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (curiosity about time vs. ethical restraint) are vivid and consistent, and the internal conflict is dramatized through specific choices like rerouting the beings to the grotto. The mother’s “ethically playful” teaching and the traded verse give idiosyncratic texture rather than archetype. The final renunciation—keeping the knot limited and “human sized”—is well earned by prior ambivalence. A slight distance from embodied emotion (more conceptual than visceral) keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is vivid, with a distinctive sensibility (hearing a pin tremble; seeing “every silence has shape”), and her motivation to engage the hush rather than flee it is clearly rooted in family stories and her artistic identity. The gift-as-burden tension is strong, though her internal conflict under pressure stays relatively serene; the decision to risk unbinding the hush never quite feels dangerous or self-threatening. The tiny relationship with Jory is quiet but apt to the hush; he’s a framing presence rather than a crucible. The final shift—choosing to keep making bonfire stories in an unfinished world—feels earned but not paid for with a deep visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific: her “affectionate detachment,” survival-driven professionalism, and sudden, costly choice to let her own shame into the petal feel fully motivated and particular. Orin is sketched more economically but still registers as an individual—his chest-touching “cracked compass” gesture, his careful half-truths, and the lantern-under-ribs walk give him weight. The central turn—choosing bitter courage over bright counterfeit absolution—emerges cleanly from her contradictions. A minor limitation is that Orin’s inner life remains mostly inferred rather than directly embodied, but that fits the tight POV.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara and Eli are sharply etched with specific professions, habits, and vulnerabilities, and Mara’s blend of shrewdness and kindness feels particular and believable. Her choice to detour with the envelope and later to fund the envelopes arises organically from traits seeded early. Internal contradiction (broker who “could squeeze tariffs” yet guards grief and compassion) is present but lightly handled, without a strongly felt cost. The overall arc is credible and affecting, if a touch gentle for top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sava’s longing “to graft herself onto community” is clear and consistently expressed through concrete choices (joining the search, bargaining for kinship knowledge, dedicating the arbor). Her interiority is mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in contradiction, so we don’t fully feel competing impulses under pressure. Secondary characters (Oren, Ilya, the council) are sketched with just enough specificity to feel real and to apply social pressure. The final request “to be named in its web not as guest but as maker” is well-earned and aligned with her earlier motives.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rin’s motivation is vivid and specific—she wants “the place where echoes are born”—and her illustrator’s eye shapes her choices (sketching patterns as she travels). Her willingness to steal time under pressure feels earned and consistent with that obsession. Internal contradiction (awe vs. risk of debt, fear of waking the Giant) is present but only lightly surfaced rather than fully dramatized. The final choice to break the cadence instead of completing it is clearly motivated yet could carry more felt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s motivation is crystal clear and particular—she wants not just her brother back, but a proof that emotions can be quantified—and her choices consistently arise from that drive. The conflict between the grieving sister who wants to run through the seam and the conjurer who “demanded proof” is sharply dramatized in the peak moment. Her gentleness and inventiveness are shown rather than told (reeds into toys, the spell-bridge ladder), and the final acceptance of “reachable, though not retrievable” feels earned. The only slight limiter for this tier is that her flaws (e.g., overreliance on abstraction) are gestured at more than they are allowed to cause real on-page damage or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s characterization is rich and particular: his map-like knowledge of the vents, refusal to steal, and “little boxes of help” all embody a coherent, idiosyncratic ethic. His core motivation—wanting to be “visible to those who need you”—is dramatized in his caches and note, not just told. The internal conflict between secrecy and visibility is subtle but present and paid off when he remains hidden yet lets himself feel seen. Secondary characters (child, librarian) are lightly drawn but function cleanly as lenses for how his presence is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and particular, from “circuitously sincere” to wanting intimacy with plants “in theory but not in skin.” Her reluctance and control-freak tendencies persist alongside growing empathy, creating credible contradiction. The shift from resisting metamorphosis (scrubbing hands, making lists) to accepting a new role as “better witness” is causally and emotionally earned. The cost—loss of analytic distance and bodily unease—is legible without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s mix of exhaustion, skepticism, and need is vivid and specific (“too porous for disbelief”), and Mara’s weary authority feels grounded and distinct. Motivation (rumor of the twin brooch, need for something to paint beyond ruins) clearly drives each choice. The final trade of the brooch is emotionally legible and costs the narrator something real. A slightly deeper on-page tug-of-war between loyalty to the sister’s memory and artistic hunger could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lan and Sera are sharply etched for the length, with clear, aligned but slightly different desires around “everyday magic.” Lan’s inner conflict while inhabited—remembering the children he helped and realizing his motive has always been Sera’s—is the strongest character beat and makes his counter-song credible. Some emotional states are more stated than embodied, and Sera in particular could use one more concrete, pressured reaction to Lan’s possession to fully deepen her arc. Still, the final shared singing reads as an earned, value-driven choice rather than a convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation and methods are clear and particular—her commitment to “navigated absences” and the staggered interviews reads as a distinct psychology rather than a generic archivist. Her key choices (spacing Sorrel’s visits, reading lists to families, staging Ilven’s return over three evenings) all grow credibly from that mindset. What’s missing, at this tier, is a deeper, embodied sense of her own conflict or cost—her interior struggle remains more inferred than dramatized. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently but stay largely functional rather than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s mix of meticulous professionalism, addiction, and self-deception is specific and textured, and her actions (mapping cracks, accepting the dare, confessing at the punch) emerge cleanly from those traits. The interior conflict between “silence felt safer than change” and her compulsion to uncover hidden routes registers. The final choice to enter the fortress, mapping as she goes, feels earned by the prior pattern of behavior rather than declared. A slightly deeper rendering of her fear or resistance in the last beats could add more visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is sharply drawn as a “sympathetic skeptic,” and her motives—skepticism, grief, and a commitment to kindness—credibly drive every major choice from volunteering to inviting Leena to write. Her internal contradiction (wanting to dismiss the tile yet choosing to participate and facilitate others’ use of it) is palpable and sustained. Jory and Leena are economical but vivid, each adding specific emotional pressure rather than generic supporting roles. The only thing keeping this just short of the very top is that some of Mara’s emotional texture is told in compact phrases rather than more fully embodied in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilias’s boredom, cowardice, and late-blooming resolve are cleanly motivated and pay off in his decision to let the amulet “rewrite” him. His dimensional awareness, jaded immortality, and manufactured intrigue feel specific rather than generic, and Maris has enough history (her failed crossing, breaking the amulet) to exert genuine pressure. The internal contradiction—wanting to know what happens after goodbye but avoiding any risk—is dramatized rather than merely asserted. A minor limitation is that his emotional texture under peak stress stays fairly composed and could show a touch more degradation in the final approach.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s characterization as a “con artist’s honest child” is vivid, internally conflicted, and her choices under pressure (siding with Sami’s truth over Ivo’s con) feel fully motivated. Her ethical “ledger” and drive to calculate fairness show up repeatedly in concrete decisions, not just labels. Ivo’s charm and exploitation are sharply drawn, and their status dynamic flips believably by the end. The only small limitation is Sami, who is functional and sympathetic but less individuated than Mara and Ivo.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Haru is sharply sketched through vocation, sensibility, and method; the paste-and-cedar detail, the gridded notes, and his “incandescent restraint” make him feel particular and embodied. His motive—to resist the town’s erasure by capturing the texture of its time—is consistent and drives every choice, including the climb to the bonsai garden. Internal conflict (invention vs honesty, mourning vs restraint) is implicit rather than dramatized in head-on contradiction, which keeps this just shy of maximal depth. The final choice to treat silence as a “pause waiting to be scored” feels earned and carries a quiet cost: he chooses careful noticing over fantasy of actual return.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and particular, from synesthetic perception (“a whisper…could feel like wet silk”) to his hunger for others’ memories to patch his erased self. Motivation—turning erasure into opportunity and then into a drive to uncover systemic forgetting—is clear and consistent. The decisive choice to hide and speak the names at the end feels earned, though internal contradiction under pressure could be sharpened further (e.g., more fear vs. curiosity in the 9H discovery beat).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli’s interiority is specific and consistent: a “myth buster” who nonetheless “chased the ache behind” hoaxes is a strong, character-particular contradiction. His reactions to each object (shell, compass, cello) reveal a mix of skepticism and longing rather than abstract curiosity. The shift from debunking to decoding “his part” in the riddle feels earned through the retold conversations, not tacked on. The one limitation is that his flaws and blind spots (e.g., why he flees conversations) stay more implied than dramatized, slightly muting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ira’s dual allegiance is sharply articulated, and her micro-choices—smiling at investors while seeding resistance via graffiti—feel rooted in that contradiction. Her emotional life is embodied (“hope rise and panic chase it”) rather than labeled, and her competence is balanced by genuine risk. Vell’s rapid reversal is slightly under-motivated at this length, softening the felt cost of her admission on the bridge. Overall, she reads as specific and morally engaged, but the climactic choice could bite a bit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara and Eli are sharply etched with economical, particular detail: her “curiosity like a tool” and shame over using the crater as cover, his hourglass and resigned loyalty to the instruments. Motivation is clear and consistent, and their exchanges under pressure (her chemical clocks, his impending obsolescence) reveal values rather than delivering exposition. The relationship shifts credibly from professional distance to a shared, intimate witnessing of loss. The only limit at this length is that Mara’s internal contradiction (duty vs private agenda) could be tested just a fraction more overtly in action rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio is vividly drawn—a blind artisan whose sensory intelligence and philosophy of “the truth things return when you touch them right” feel specific and grounded in his work. His competence and calm under pressure are compelling, but he borders on idealized: there’s little visible doubt, frustration, or genuine risk of failure in him. Secondary characters (courier, Sera) are functional foils whose reactions sketch stakes and trust without much inner texture. The closing shift is more in Sera’s trust than in Lio’s growth, so the cost to him remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Riven’s voice and professional sensibility are vivid and particular, with clear motivation rooted in duty, curiosity, and a wary awareness of political stakes. His dry wit and methodical thinking show through concrete choices (tracing condensation, deciding to trek to the source), but his internal conflict—between mapping for power and honoring what he finds—remains more implied than actively dramatized. Lysa functions mostly as a calm foil and moral echo, adding atmosphere rather than direct pressure. The final stance (choosing to “simply listen” for a minute) is credible and earned, though the personal cost is largely projected into the future rather than felt immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sava is sharply sketched as a cryptic, obsessive specialist whose actions (walking until his soles bleed, using the fork as a “compass”) consistently serve his stated motive of restoring balance. His interiority is mostly implied through behavior and metaphor rather than direct thought, which fits the fable-like tone but slightly flattens psychological nuance. Mara’s mini-arc from baffled observer to co-creator of the rhythm is clear and credible, though still thin. The final communal shift feels earned by their accumulated choices, but the individual emotional cost remains more mythic than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives (salvage worker seeking to “harness the ephemeral” and save her crew) are clear and remain consistent under pressure, and her micro-choices—overriding instinct to flee, using the vial, sharing memories—are motivated and particular. Interiority is evocative and embodied (“each exhale made silver beads…like unanswered prayers”) and her contradiction between survival panic and almost devotional curiosity feels human. The final choice to bind her own memories to the temple’s network has a visible cost in air and self-exposure and is well earned. The only limit keeping this out of the 9-band is that her flaw set and blind spots (e.g., greed vs duty, fear vs obsession) could be shaded with just a touch more specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—chasing “hush” to complete the story his father botched—is vivid, consistent, and governs every choice, especially not touching the bodies and leaving the door ajar. Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic, not generic, and we feel the tension between wanting truth known and wanting to avoid spectacle. The inherited stigma (“lies ran in blood”) grounds his self-concept and risks. Internal conflict is subtle rather than explosive, which slightly softens the felt cost but remains credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s guilt, pragmatism, and capacity for sacrifice are all legible and consistent, with the lifelong/other-life debt giving his choices a satisfying weight. The bride reads as a clear, specific pressure rather than a generic ghost, especially in the “you owe me” beat and the ash-veil imagery. The final act of returning the bead and aligning his heartbeat to it feels psychologically and morally earned by the prior visits and revelations. If anything, his internal tug-of-war between self-preservation and restitution could be pressed a shade harder before he yields.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ila’s characterization is rich and specific: her weaver’s mind translates everything into overlaps, threads, and seams, and this directly motivates her unusual solution to the labyrinth. Her optimism “that walks beside grief without denying it” is vivid, if more stated than tested on the page. The brother’s prior escape and the town’s grief give her drive weight, but her internal conflict is relatively mild; she rarely doubts or pays a sharply felt personal price. Secondary figures (dockhands, smugglers, widows, town) are effectively sketched but largely function as chorus rather than as crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is rich and specific: her history of interrupted journeys, her distrust of miracles but trust in work, and the moment she realizes her faith depended on arrival give her a textured, believable psyche. Her micro-choices—listening to drafts like pages, cataloging bones with apologies, choosing to keep the tomb open—align cleanly with that characterization and reveal a hierarchy of values. Father Sava is sketched economically but credibly, with his caution and softening at the notebook. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of her final decision to stay is implied rather than sharply dramatized in a single pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s profession, ethics, and curiosity are sharply etched, and their choice to use the privacy window to scan the margins feels both character-true and consequential. The courier is economically but effectively drawn through fear signals (trembling fingers, glances at mirrors) that pressure the narrator’s choices. Internal tension between doing the contracted “simple” job and honoring the margins’ meaning runs through the piece without being over-explained. The final act of naming her “M. Return” and setting the trap reads as an earned stance rather than a neat twist.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s characterization is vivid and particular—the galaxy-chart embroiderer whose apparent foolishness masks a sharp, pattern-seeing mind—and her motives (listening for “unheard stories” and countering the coup) cleanly drive her choices. Her tactic of coded embroidery and feigned simplicity under interrogation shows consistent, value-revealing behavior under pressure. The relationship with Kest is sketched efficiently through code-laden banter and status dynamics, giving their alliance emotional and professional weight. Internal contradiction (fear vs. playful performance) is mostly implied rather than explicitly felt in the body, which keeps this just short of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation—finding a way to inhabit the moment before her disastrous non-apology—is sharply drawn and governs every choice, from carrying the shard and unsent letters to tearing the first one up. Her internal conflict between pride and longing is dramatized rather than summarized, especially in the scene where she offers the spirits the original apology as proof she wants the “moment before deciding.” Emotional states are embodied and specific (the satchel pressed to her ribs; roots clasping her ankles “like questions”), and her final apology to Elias feels earned by the groundwork. Elias is sparely sketched but his wariness and ache at the end still register as a real counter-presence rather than a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lani’s interiority is rich and particular—her fear, her trauma with sound, and her professional instincts all cohere and drive micro-choices (rubbing the coral, choosing to translate the notes before the captain’s questions). Her empathy-based “dictionary of shared anxieties” is dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the radio call where she reframes both men’s fears. The boy and the captain are more lightly sketched but still specific, with Mako’s role as emotional crucible earning its payoff in the final grafting metaphor. There’s modest room for deeper contradiction in Lani under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive—recovering a lost, non-transactional joy in art—is clear from the outset and consistently drives her choices (pursuing the rumor, following the fog, deciding to display the process). Her interiority is concrete and character-specific (“even her dream self knew memories were never so polite as negatives”), with her profession and prior festival work shading how she perceives everything. The internal conflict between commissioned work/ownership and communal art/joy is present but remains gently articulated rather than fully stressed in a crucible. The final renunciation—choosing to share the lamp and fragment and invite others into her “network”—feels earned, but the cost is more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and textured—her shift from bill-paying certainty to curiosity is dramatized through habits (counting echoes, carrying the nickel) and micro-choices. The story shows her in genuine conflict between professional training (“restorers are trained never to do [this]”) and the invitation to listen and not-know. The relationship with Tomas is minimal but effective, functioning as external pressure via the repeated question. The final “I do not know yet” feels earned by the prior testing rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator and Lio are sharply etched in a small space, with vocation (entomologist/gardener) and attitude (“stubbornness,” Lio’s prankishness) informing their choices. Motivation is coherent and consistent: the narrator’s hesitation about planting the seed and eventual complicity track with fear and stubborn care for her refuge. Lio’s charm and methodical subversion read through behavior, not labels, especially in the way he “steal[s] despair, returning curiosity.” Internal contradiction (fear vs. defiance) is present but could be embodied more directly at the climax for an even stronger sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s characterization as shy yet driven, sleepless but purposeful, is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (accepting the task, apologizing to the water, tearing the card) all fit that core. Her emotional life is embodied in images (card against her heart, “unspent years” in her eyes) rather than labels. The central choice to sacrifice the postcard—and thus her last tangible tie to Iren—feels motivated and consequential. Internal contradiction (duty vs. private longing) is present but could be a shade sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The caretaker’s motive—preserving forgotten names—is clear, consistent, and drives all major actions. Interiority is specific and embodied (“foxglove regret blooming in my throat”), and small coping tactics in the Hall of Apologies show character under pressure. Internal contradiction (duty vs. loneliness/regret) is present but fairly subdued rather than sharply dramatized. The final softening from regret to “almost like gratitude” feels earned and credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation (restore trust, neutralize a feared spell) is clear and consistently rooted in her “carefully reckless” nature, and her guilt-driven silence versus desire to repair are in active tension in-scene. Her micro-choices—stealing the codex, hiding it, then risking public ritual and confession—feel well-earned and costly. The relationship with Ilyon functions as a crucible, with his own confession complicating blame and status. There could be slightly more embodied, moment-to-moment emotion under peak pressure, but what’s here is specific and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s blend of technical competence, ethical seriousness, and hunger for “kind” numbers is sharply rendered, and her micro-choices under pressure (decoding the note, reframing the proposal, offering Rolen the chain) feel grounded in that characterization. Her internal contradiction—loyal to safety and structure yet moved by encrypted care and old songs—is present without being over-explained. Rolen is sketched efficiently but distinctly, and his eventual confession is well-motivated by prior hints. The only minor limitation is that the council and shrine-keepers remain more symbolic than individuated, keeping the relational crucible somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her beam-walking, dust-reading, and paper forgery create a coherent portrait of someone who survives by controlling narratives. Her ambivalence about Oren and Merek is dramatized rather than told, and the final act of trust is clearly earned from prior contradictions. The relationship with Merek, especially his trembling at the music and late confession, effectively sharpens her choice. A slightly more embodied, moment-to-moment sense of Mara’s physical stress at the decisive beat could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to understand sacred thresholds and her father’s disappearance—is clear and specific, and her final decision to cross reads earned. Interiority is strong conceptually but a bit cool emotionally; we get ideas more than embodied contradiction under stress. The “ethical line” realization before she jumps is compelling but could use one sharper flash of doubt or fear to deepen cost. Overall, she feels particular and coherent, if slightly more thematic than flesh-and-blood.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira and Jonah are both sharply etched in a small space, with distinct motives—her quest for “the rhythm of belonging,” his stubborn loyalty to the facility—made legible through specific choices rather than labels. Jonah’s reluctance to open the terrarium is an excellent, character-particular embodiment of his loneliness. Their relationship genuinely shifts by the end, from wary strangers to co-cartographers of the algae-zodiac. The only ceiling is that Mira’s internal contradiction under pressure remains relatively gentle and underexplored compared to what this premise could bear.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s drive to understand vanishing paths and Mira’s guilt over her broken promise are clean, specific motivations that credibly power their choices. Interiority is vivid and particular (“cheerful gloom,” “someone had walked here recently with terror in their throat”), and the occupational lens of a “sea-foam recollectionist” feels integrated. The final change—Mira confessing and the narrator reframing paths as emotional routes—is earned by prior setup rather than tacked on. What keeps this below the top band is that internal contradiction under peak pressure (especially for the narrator) remains lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s characterization as an analytical performer who engineers “serendipity” is vivid and consistent, and his choices in the crisis (laying out options, using the bishop as wedge) arise cleanly from that established mindset. His vow to serenade monotony gives him a recognizable, particular drive, and the night watchwoman has enough edge and skepticism to feel like more than a prop. Internal contradiction—control vs openness to chance—is present but kept mostly at the conceptual level rather than fully dramatized as emotional conflict in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motives (rejecting mind-editing, preserving forbidden nostalgia through embodied verse) are clear, consistent, and drive each choice, especially her decision to accept anchoring in exchange for learning. Her emotional progression from panic to rhythmic attunement to committed exile reads embodied and specific to a “tide dancer.” The brief but pointed interaction with the keeper surfaces a credible internal conflict between safety and integrity. There could be a touch more contradiction or vulnerability around her larger mission to avoid her feeling almost archetypal.

    Ilya’s motives—protecting ordinary, working light against erasure—are specific, consistent, and expressed through concrete professional habits (the glazier’s satchel, the choice of plain harbor glass). His nocturnal pond ritual adds idiosyncratic depth rather than generic “brooding.” Internal contradiction is mild (he feels powerless yet keeps acting), and the inspector’s shift is credible but a touch quick, leaving limited room for messier resistance or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is rich and specific: the lie about Eli clearly scars her and credibly drives both her insomnia and her choice to mentor Jonah through confession rather than pep talk. Her internal contradictions—tough leader versus guilty liar, protector of a child versus believer in responsibility—are woven into concrete choices rather than labels. Jonah’s fear of causing harm is clear, though his shift from frozen rookie to steady-handed listener verges on tidy. The closing decision to confess feels earned and costly, not conveniently redemptive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mina’s characterization as a “logical dreamer” is specific and consistently dramatized through her notebooks, methodical experiments, and interpretive stance toward the gauge. Motivation is clear and stable, but internal conflict is muted: she rarely feels genuinely torn or pressured, and fear or doubt never bite hard enough to complicate her choices. Her change at the end (from solitary experimenter to communal leader) is credible but relatively smooth, with little visible cost beyond fatigue implied off-page. The ensemble Minas concept adds depth to her sense of self but stays mostly conceptual rather than sharply embodied as emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives (professional commission vs. private desire to hear “what walls dream about”) are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially her lie to the Restoration Office. The discovery that Arlen is her grandfather and that her mother’s voice is archived personalizes the stakes in a way that feels earned, not contrived. Interiority is specific and embodied through her acoustic sensitivity and physical mapping. The final renunciation (suppressing the chamber from her report) is well motivated with a legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear from the outset (save the sister) and grows more complex once the boy’s life is revealed as the cost, with the heartbeat loan as a strong character-defining constraint. Interiority is specific and embodied, especially in how the “borrowed heartbeat” responds to lullabies and moral pressure. The final renunciation—returning the heartbeat—is well earned by prior setup and carries visible ethical cost. The mirage painter is sketched economically but distinctly, with her composure and methods reflecting a believable, if enigmatic, worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sera is sharply drawn: a weary professional whose guilt and need for redemption concretely shape her choices (the terrace, the ritual, adding her own map to the fire). Her interiority is specific—burn scars, the corridor massacre, the weight of the clipboard—rather than generic angst. Secondary characters (Maro, Odran, the girl) are economical but distinct through their offerings and vows. The internal conflict—gentle method vs unforgiving consequences—could surface in one more moment of in-scene hesitation to be truly masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Inez’s blend of ruthless exploitation and fragile sentiment (“her white coat flapping like a flag that had forgotten its nation”) is specific and consistent, and every choice flows from that contradiction. Her decision to manufacture the drought is fully motivated by both profit and grief. The final act of dropping the egg feels like an earned renunciation rather than a tidy epiphany. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (salt cutting her soles, throat tightening) rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maris’s motive—freeing her sister and the city from coerced vows—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her dual role as “chaste courtesan” and subversive agent is embodied in how she uses compliance as cover. The interiority is mostly implied through controlled physicality rather than overt thought, which suits the tone but slightly mutes the sense of active inner conflict during the climax. Her near-freeze at hearing her sister’s echo is the sharpest glimpse of contradiction and cost and works very well. The governor is sketched effectively as a status foil, though he reads as more emblematic than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s arc from defensive artist to someone who signs away unilateral control is psychologically coherent and well motivated, with the story stick and reversal motif externalizing his internal conflict. His serenity, guilt over the stolen stick, and increasing ethical clarity coexist on the page, giving him credible contradiction rather than sainthood. The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible: her boundary-setting (“I did not want my own experiences turned into material”) directly forces his most costly choice. If anything, Mara remains a little emblematic compared to Ilya, but her limited presence still carries real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arin’s motives are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: he’s an “esoteric realist” whose blend of practical saving and symbolic honoring drives every choice. His attention to names, knots, and transient structures reveals a coherent value hierarchy under gentle pressure. What’s missing, at an elite level, is a sharper sense of contradiction or genuine internal struggle; he rarely feels in danger of choosing wrongly. The single crack in his voice is evocative but not quite enough to register as a full-on crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation is crystalline—atonement through craft—and their lost-wax background and meticulousness inform every choice. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“carried that mistake like an ingot in my chest”) with a credible tension between shame, reverence, and emerging hope. The Archivist is lightly sketched but functions effectively as a moral and professional counterpoint without stealing focus. The final realization about forgiveness feels earned by prior action rather than imposed, though the piece could suggest a sharper irreducible flaw or lingering limitation to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation (to understand why paths choose walkers and to be worthy of that choosing) is clear, specific, and deepens as the piece unfolds. Interiority is vivid and particular (“precisely playful, testing each fork like a joke with a blade hidden in the punchline”), with a credible blend of curiosity, fear, and ambition. The internal contradiction—wanting agency while suspecting they are being chosen—drives the final stance. The only mild limit is that we see little genuine resistance or failure under pressure; the transformation feels more like deepening than a hard-won pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Nabu-iddin is sharply etched as a frugal, grief-marked empiricist whose habits (reusing tablets, counting copper nails) convincingly set up his later sacrifice of certainty. His motivations are coherent and specific: a blend of professional rigor, hatred of waste, and wary curiosity toward the unknown. The final act of snapping his calibrated stylus reads as an earned renunciation, rooted in these traits. The main limitation is that his internal conflict between empiricism and devotion is stated more than dramatized in embodied, moment-to-moment hesitation at the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s pacifist scheming and Mara’s knife-clenched vigilance are cleanly motivated and consistently dramatized, and the final relinquishing of the knife feels earned by the pattern of prior choices. Interiority is selective but apt, with Lio’s belief in redirection over confrontation embodied in how he uses the music box. The main weakness is that Mara’s internal resistance and turn soften a bit quickly, with relatively little embodied struggle before she yields. A touch more moment-to-moment contradiction in her body or thoughts at the climax would deepen the cost of her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s motivation—to catch up to the “runaway dream” with crafted instruments—is clear, persistent, and rooted in his temperament as a grounded artisan. The tension between his love of straight edges and a world that “refused lines” gives him some genuine contradiction, but his internal conflict could be pushed further under peak pressure. Emotional embodiment is mostly carried through attention to tools and environment rather than explicit feeling, which suits the piece but keeps us at a slight remove. The closing choice to hold the mirror as a “second heart” feels earned by his prior methods and obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motivation (retrieve the ribbon, reclaim her vocation’s meaning) is clear and consistent, and her pride vs. care conflict is nicely dramatized in her reluctance to touch the boy’s eye after losing her license. Her embodied habits (feisty grumble, thinking in terms of small objects and lessons) feel particular rather than generic. The children register as distinct, pressuring presences whose reactions alter her stance. The final vow reads earned by prior beats, though the emotional cost of defying the guild could be shaded even more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives (professional duty, forbidden knowledge, familial warning) are clear and drive her micro-choices, especially her decision to accept the trap and “keep it complicated.” Her internal contradiction—ethical unease vs. ravenous curiosity—is well dramatized through the cameo, the mirrors, and the logbook, not just stated. The main limitation is a slight thinness in embodied emotion; we live mostly in her intellect and pattern-recognition rather than her body under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysa’s motivation and competence are sharply drawn—her arcane linguistics, ethical refusal to let Orren pay with a childhood, and pattern of “renegotiation” read consistent and specific. However, interiority is mostly implied rather than embodied; we don’t feel much physical or emotional degradation under stress. The relationship with Orren stays functional rather than crucible-like, with limited pressure on their bond. The change at the end (Lysa assuming the role of corrector/guide) is earned conceptually but carries little felt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s longing for Lio and compulsion to collect lost-twin stories are clear, and her final choice to “trade certainty” grows organically from what we’ve seen. The chimera-twin idea gives her a specific psychic fracture, but her internal conflict is more stated than deeply embodied in moment-to-moment sensation. Her micro-choices—testing the filament, entering the gallery, deciding to narrate rescues—track cleanly with her drive. Emotional texture could deepen slightly under peak pressure, but the arc is coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is sharply drawn—competent, principled, with a distinct professional mindset—and her motivation to turn confusion into clarity cleanly underpins each choice. The key emotional turn (“She felt anger, then steadier purpose…”) is earned but relatively smooth, with little on-page hesitation or self-contradiction. Internal conflict (duty to truth vs institutional loyalty or personal safety) remains mostly implied rather than dramatized through fraught micro-choices. Her success in the ritual also comes a bit too easily, softening the sense of struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sava’s motivation and competence are clear and particular, and her profession (mapkeeper by harmonics) convincingly shapes every choice. Her emotional life is mostly inferred through controlled diction (“hammered repose”) rather than dramatized contradiction, so internal conflict feels a bit underdeveloped. Still, her arc from reactive mapper to negotiator of a compact with refugees is earned and coherent. The beings’ hinted interiority (“thoughts like distant thunder”) adds nuance without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—“meaning was all I had left to prove I was not alone”—with a clear obsession driving every choice. The retrocognitive talent, loneliness, and hunger for pattern make the custodian feel specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction (faith in meaning vs fear of randomness) is present but could be dramatized more sharply in on-page hesitation or missteps. The final shift from solitary watcher to member of a “we” is earned and emotionally credible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives—duty to the Archive vs fear of losing their own contours—are specific, consistent, and deepened by the “preemptively nostalgic” self-awareness. Micro-choices (continuing from pillar to pillar, accepting more memories despite that fear, finally offering their own) arise organically from these tensions. Emotion is embodied through textured perceptions rather than labels (“stranger's childhood pressed against my ribs like a borrowed book”). The only limitation is that the internal contradiction, while strong, is resolved fairly smoothly for this length, with little visible residue of damage beyond the widened self.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jorin is sharply etched—his chants, occupational detail, and “defy gravity of hopelessness” motive feel specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (passport joke, accepting a diversionary brief, redirecting the show toward the gate) all fit that spine. Internal contradiction is present but muted; he rarely doubts or missteps, so his arc leans more toward competent execution than pressured transformation. Mirel and the council are functional but thin, mostly serving as levers rather than fully pressured characters. The ending gesture of giving the rag knot to the boy nicely externalizes Jorin’s values, giving his role a modest but satisfying evolution rather than a major turn.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation (to capture/understand time’s texture and protect her work) is clear, specific, and governs every choice, including the lie by omission about the copied pages. Her internal conflict between love/loyalty to Iven and secret defiance is credible and plays out in real-time micro-choices (the tangent about their first pool, the withheld confession). Iven is sketched efficiently but with depth—his thumb at the cloak seam, fear of being left behind, and softened anger under memory all feel lived. The final stance (redirecting their watching rather than martyring herself here) is earned and carries a quiet but discernible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s claustrophobia, skepticism, and curiosity are embodied and specific (“I screamed, not from height but from the sudden idea of falling into open space with nothing to press against my ribs”). The father’s methods and worldview are clear and consistently dramatized rather than explained. Internal contradiction (wanting strongest hush despite danger; fear of walls and fear of open) is present in scene, not just stated. The closing choice to seek and then live with the gilded hush feels earned and costly, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn through his rituals, tools, and backstory, and his motive—to “teach silence how to comfort”—credibly governs his minute choices (meter, brake, voice). Mara is more schematic: “eyes swollen from trying to hold grief still” is vivid but her grief’s specifics remain vague, so her change feels slightly more conceptual than embodied. The relationship dynamic—gentle, professional guidance under pressure—is well-rendered, but internal contradiction under stress is subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The final shift (Mara standing steady in the hush) is earned but pays more in idea than in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ione’s motivation is clean, character-specific, and consistent—her lore-keeper identity and “wisely adventurous” streak clearly drive each choice. The refusal to claim the throne in favor of “I bring witnesses” is earned and thematically aligned. What keeps this shy of top-tier is the relative lack of on-page internal conflict at the key moment; temptation to lie and take power is mentioned but never really felt or struggled with. Emotions are more implied through action than deeply embodied, which slightly flattens the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives and flaws are sharply etched: her ritualistic “bridge burning” is both survival strategy and core wound, and the Lio beat forces her to act against that pattern at real emotional cost. Her interiority feels specific (“made distance deliberate, then listened to the quiet until it stopped sounding like punishment”) rather than generic. Internal contradiction—needing distance vs. needing to answer the ring—is present but could be slightly more dramatized in the moment of choice, not just implied by backstory. Lio is more emblematic than fleshed-out, but that suits the story’s scale and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and specific: the pyramid-scheme shame, the desire for a “better alchemy,” and her tether to the submarine bolt give her a distinct psychology. Her temptation to shortcut via another dream versus her choice to tell the painful truth is an earned, motivated conflict. The internal contradiction (hustler instincts vs. ethical repair) is implied more than dramatized in scene, and her emotions stay somewhat conceptual rather than fully embodied. Still, the final renunciation—offering her worst memory—clearly forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leander’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives every action, and his “eloquently silent” nature is convincingly enacted (no dialogue, social isolation, ministers forced to attend to his silence). However, his internal conflict is relatively subdued: he moves from research to abdication with little on-page ambivalence or resistance, so the emotional cost of ending the dynasty feels more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Calven’s interiority is rich and particular—his sense of the greenhouse as a chapel and his “steady hand that did not match his shaking heart” quickly individuate him. His core contradiction (vowed silence/obedience vs hunger to witness and choose possibility) runs through every beat and credibly culminates in taking the compass and implicitly stepping away from his order. His emotional states are embodied and specific (the “shivering bliss” at each unsnapping, the smell of “spring and graves”), and his final pledge reads as an earned stance, not a convenient epiphany. The only small limitation is that his prior life with the order is gestured at more than dramatized, slightly softening the felt cost of that renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s grief, meticulousness, and stubborn gentleness are sharply etched, and her motive—to “magnify small kindnesses”—credibly drives every choice from noticing the dust map to how she curates what to tell Josie. Her emotional contradictions (hurt yet hopeful, tactful yet relentless) are embodied in concrete actions rather than labels. Josie is thinner but still individuated through guardedness and sharp questions in a short space. The final shift—Mara’s grief turning from “weight into a lens”—feels earned by what we’ve seen her do in the file room.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s competence and smallness-as-cover are clear and consistent, and her choices (going to the booth, deciding to target the plates) feel grounded in that characterization. Interiority is present but relatively streamlined; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure beyond a brief swallow of fear. Her motivation to resist erasure is coherent, but the emotional cost of being rewritten into nonexistence could be more viscerally embodied. The relationship with the courier is functional rather than crucible-like, giving us little added depth.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s motive—hushing the prophecy to save the town—is clear and coherently rooted in his history with his mother and the grotto. The inheritance of the vest and his memory of her instruction (“things you did not fight with volume but with a vested hush”) give him specificity and make his tactics feel personal rather than generic. The internal conflict between preserving his mother’s voice and preventing harm is present but could be dramatized more viscerally in the moment of choice rather than mostly described in advance. Still, his final endurance in accepting the loss as the price of protecting the town reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s motivation is clear, particular, and sustained—from quiet curiosity about the leafscript to a principled drive to honor the forgotten—and his mossy, tactile habits make him feel specific rather than archetypal. His actions (taking the leaf to his shelf, experimenting, opening the vault, then going public) consistently flow from that inner stance. The internal conflict is relatively gentle—he never seriously wavers between safety and revelation—which trims some potential complexity. Still, the final shift into “hope” is earned by prior choices and the cost of confronting the elders’ secret.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s worldview (“every clock kept two times”) and her attraction to uncertainty give her coherent, particular motives, and her decision to take the admiral’s case feels grounded in that psychology. Her embodied struggle is brief but pointed in the waterfall sequence where she uses gears as “stepping teeth.” Corin is serviceable and thematically apt but arrives late enough that the relationship pressure never deepens beyond a cleanly functional bargain. The internal contradiction—wanting to plan yet “befriend uncertainty”—is present but could be dramatized more in on-page dilemmas rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s motives are clear, layered, and under pressure: professional obligation to balance gain/loss, personal shame over “lightening” her own name, and a reluctant, growing responsibility toward Orin and his mother. Her internal conflict between wanting resurrection and honoring the factual limits of her craft is explicitly dramatized (“My heart wants resurrection, but the facts of my craft deny it”). Micro-choices—spending her own name, confessing stolen names, insisting on balance with Ellis—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values and visible cost. The final stance (accepting responsibility and a lighter, more honest name) is earned and forecloses her old shortcut habits.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s mix of competence, past guilt, and insistence on laughter as “strange medicine” makes her feel particular, and the parallel with Elowen’s grief gives their interaction real emotional bite. Her micro-choices—walking with an unlit lantern, approaching Elowen slowly, offering the tooth rather than an argument—track clearly with her motives. Elowen’s self-condemnation and the unspeakable thought about wanting to run are strong, believable flaws rather than softened excuses. If anything, Mara’s own buried grief is resolved a touch quickly at the end, slightly undercutting the felt cost of her internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (refusal of repentance vs. drive to extract the “mathematics of mercy”) are clear, specific, and consistently embodied through proprioceptive discomfort and trauma-linked cognition. Contradictory impulses are live on the page—revulsion at penance rituals alongside a willingness to re-enter pain for others’ sake. Micro-choices (looping the strap like a rosary, walking deeper, bracing against trees) feel organically compelled by both fear and obligation. The final shift—reframing mercy as release for the tortured, including herself—is earned and forecloses simple victimhood without absolving the torturers.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, childhood apprenticeship, and grief over the mother create a coherent, particular psychology with clear motivation (“to honor the people in those paintings”). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory perception rather than label-speak, though contradictory impulses under pressure (fear vs duty, doubt vs faith) are more implied than dramatized. Her choices—to return, to trust intuition, to manipulate the environment—track logically with that history. The final endurance/stance (anchoring overlooked histories in the streets and lessons) feels earned but carries only a softly sketched cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s profession, ghost-work, and observational compulsion fuse into a very particular psyche, and his micro-choices (studying dust before touching controls, deciding to free the old mechanism, marking the crack) all feel grounded in that. The “weightless burden” of tending the dead is specific and embodied in his careful procedures. Internal contradiction is quietly present—he’s both technician-pragmatic and almost priestlike with ghosts—though the conflict never spikes into a hard on-page dilemma. The endurance at the end (continuing this vocation, taking the barrel) reads as earned stasis with a felt ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s motives and contradictions are cleanly sketched—the perfectionist who mistrusts perfection, the longing for Mara that makes him risk rupture—and his choices clearly emerge from those traits. His emotional life is largely conveyed conceptually (“he distrusted perfection”) rather than through embodied sensation in the moment, which slightly flattens peak beats. Still, the final decision to sacrifice systemic stability for one compressed instant with Mara feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Len and Yara are sharply etched with clear, conflicting motives—his need to reimagine, her need for restoration—and those motives drive every key choice. Interiority is concrete and particular (e.g., Len’s “poet’s habit of naming shadows,” his prison-learned mirror tactic) and their shared grief gives their courtesy bite. The final joint decision to stage a third-path exhibition is fully earned by what we’ve seen of their flaws and longings. If anything, Yara’s inner life could bear one more embodied moment under pressure to match Len’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivo’s vocation-driven motivation and ethical framework (truth-binding, Covenant of Rust) are clear and consistent, and his choices directly drive the story. However, his interior conflict under pressure is lightly sketched—he’s almost serenely competent, with little felt fear, doubt, or contradictory impulse on the page. The Midnight Thief’s confession adds nuance but is brief, so their dynamic never fully becomes a crucible. The final choice to mend the Thief reads earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivations are clear, specific, and consistent—from labeling rain to seeking “the place where explanations fail,” her choices feel credibly rooted in curiosity and sensibly odd pragmatism. Interiority is vivid and embodied through her sensory focus and relationship with tools (jars, compass), and her final actions—leaving the compass, offering petrichor—are earned by the prior pattern. The main limitation is relatively soft internal contradiction; we don’t see much simultaneous pull between safety and risk or belief and doubt on the page, only her steady drift toward mystery. The change at the end reads more as ratified stance than deeply contested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific—the driftwood sculptor whose “language” becomes sculpture is an excellent, grounded choice, and her mix of fear, curiosity, and wry humor (“half laughing, half terrified”) feels particular and embodied. Her perpetual learning trait is dramatized through her taking in information from the projected figures and translating it into physical signs. Internal conflict is relatively low-stakes and cerebral; she adapts quickly and rarely seems in genuine danger of refusing the invitation, which keeps this just shy of the top band. The final choice—to commit to alliance-making as a craft—not only fits everything we’ve seen but also forecloses the safer path of treating the lantern as a curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lina’s motivation—braiding her hunger to understand the night blooms with grief for her mother—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from taking the cathedral job to climbing to the window. Her interiority is conveyed through attention and action rather than abstract labels, and she reads as a particular person (the satchel of postcards, the way she listens to drafts and hours). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (quiet, observant temperament versus an almost obsessive “hunger” for answers), and could be sharpened slightly in the window scene itself. The final renunciation—accepting her mother’s covert engineering as care rather than mystery—feels earned and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The archivist’s professional rigor versus the visceral pull of the letters is well etched, especially in “trained to treat paper as evidence and grief as a datum, yet the envelope seal had burned my fingers.” Their motivation is clear and consistent, and the ethical calculus at the lagoon (“publish the truth with names redacted until families consented”) feels rooted in character rather than imposed. Internal contradiction is present but could be pushed further—there’s little sense that they might actually walk away or misuse the material. Lila’s presence is vivid for an off-page figure, though her subjectivity is mostly instrumental to the archivist’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sen’s motivations are lucid and consistent—his rejection of “false comfort” and institutional failure from the academy makes his ethic of work vs. magic feel fully earned, and his restraint with the bottle is a credible extension of that. The interior conflict around the bottle’s throb vs. his principles gives him dimensionality. Emotional states are mostly embodied in concrete perception and action (soap on shrine steps, lanterns, council). A minor limitation is that secondary characters remain sketched rather than dramatically pressuring his values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Erem’s characterization is rich and particular: a clerk-ascetic whose compulsion to record emotional residue makes his choice to intervene feel earned. His fear that mere listening might bind the city to disaster is a sharp, character-specific internal conflict. The final stance—acting anyway but ending in “soft unease”—reads as an earned endurance rather than a neat resolution. A slight limitation is that his professional life and personal history, beyond the field trip, are only lightly dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s interiority is specific and textured—“furiously tranquil” with a “quiet storm in his chest”—and his choices (opening the spiral, then choosing to repay the loan through order) are clearly motivated by curiosity, grief, and responsibility. The realization that his seed work has always been payment is earned by prior details, not a bolt-on epiphany. Internal contradiction (desire to touch stolen time vs. obligation to mend chaos) is present, though it could be sharpened into one more concrete moment of temptation or potential misuse. The relationship with the grandmother works as a pressure source despite being entirely off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maris’s motives are specific, coherent, and under pressure: duty to the Office, empathy for listeners, and a professional obsession with nuance all collide in the zero-hour choice. Her internal conflict between “make it loud” institutional fear and “favor listening over noise” is dramatized rather than stated, especially in the moment she rewires the control box. The cost of defying the dispatcher (job, liability) is lightly sketched but clear enough to charge her choice. Brother Ivo is sketched economically yet functions as a human counterpoint to institutional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s interiority is specific and embodied—his grief, ritualistic cleaning, and reverence for the sky are all vividly particular, not generic. His conflicting impulses (need for solitude vs inviting others into the ritual) produce a credible, earned shift by the end. A few phrases edge toward abstract self-description (“find strength in vulnerability”) rather than staying entirely inside his sensorium, which slightly blunts the otherwise excellent character work.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives are precise and particular: a survivor who hoards unspoken sentences out of a quasi-religious obligation, then is forced to choose between preservation and release. Her “tranquilly perceptive” habit is dramatized in how she reads ghosts and Mara’s gestures rather than told once and forgotten. The internal conflict between honoring the covenant by keeping and by letting go is clearly staged in the choice to open the box and read. A slight limitation is that we get less trace of her pettier or more self-protective impulses, which might deepen the cost of that final relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation—wanting to feel the “texture” of time rather than extend it—is specific and consistently dramatized, and his choice to trade the urn shard for a truth is clearly rooted in his grief and profession. His interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., “as if faith could tick”), though we see little active internal contradiction at the decision point—he doesn’t visibly hesitate or waver. Mara functions well as a focused foil with a clear role but remains largely a thematic instrument rather than a fully pressured character. The final shift into a duty beyond measure feels earned but is accepted with relative ease, softening the sense of cost on a psychological level.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rian’s motivation—to honor and mend imperfect things—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete micro-choices (tide pool, net, kite, drake). His interiority feels particular rather than generic, especially in what he finds “pleasing” about frayed string and unfinished gestures. The relationships with the brothers and the child are sketched efficiently and do exert real, if gentle, pressure on his values. The change at the end is subtle but earned: he recommits to his ethic by giving up the feather and accepting a poem that “finally held” precisely because of its imperfections.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—her belief that “species watched one another” convincingly drives every choice, especially the remodeling under physical strain. However, she borders on saintly; we rarely see contradictory impulses or pettier emotions under the death sentence, which flattens her complexity. The monks function more as a foil than as true pressure, so relational conflict never quite bites. Her final endurance and handoff of the diary feel earned, but the cost is more thematic than deeply personal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motives (skeptical scientist vs council instrument) are clear and consistently drive choices: refusing headset filters, cracking the vial, and stealing the shard. Interiority feels particular (lab dyes, tracer self-testing) and reveals a believable blend of curiosity, defiance, and wonder. The final theft is well-earned by prior traits, though the emotional cost of betraying the council is more implied than embodied. A touch more contradictory feeling under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator is sharply etched through role, skills, and inherited duty, with vivid particulars like learning “dead languages” as labor rather than prayer. Motivation is clear—fulfilling the council’s charge and negotiating with the dead—but internal contradiction (duty vs doubt, grief vs hope) remains mostly implicit rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Emotional texture is largely carried by atmosphere rather than explicit felt struggle. The final stance—offering “the dead a future tense”—feels earned but could carry more visible cost if his ambivalence were more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s voice, sensory logic (naming by smells), and loyalty to Sera and Morrow create a vivid, particular psyche whose choices clearly arise from established values. Morrow is an excellent foil: his history and present gentleness deepen both the moral stakes and Lio’s decisions (“he still wanted to translate distance into closeness”). Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—Lio moves from doubt to action without much on-page ambivalence—which slightly limits psychological complexity. Still, the final stance (choosing public risk over settlement safety beside Sera) feels earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motives—returning despite exile, honoring the grandmother, needing alignment—are clear and cohere with every choice. Interiority is specific and embodied (“each breath unspooled behind me”) rather than abstract. The internal change from self-blaming “curse” to self-as-calibrated-instrument is credible and earned. Slightly more on-page contradiction or risk around leaving the station would push the arc even deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (amend a past failure, keep chivalrous promises while thieving) and a distinct worldview (“sacredly playful”) give the narrator specificity. His micro-choices at the gate, the chapel, and the rooftop all arise from these traits. However, internal contradiction and fear are underplayed—he moves from plan to leap with little on-page hesitation, so the climactic choice costs him less viscerally than it could. Serren is sketched effectively but remains more emblematic mentor than fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation (“historian of small gestures”) is specific, consistent, and drives every major choice from carrying the pawnless board to risking imprisonment to save testimony. Interiority is vivid and embodied (the ribs remembering the bridge, the smell of paper and dried violets), and the contrast between performed panic and inner calculation gives them layered complexity. The “benevolently ruthless” self-conception is shown rather than told, especially in ripping the archive bundles and prioritizing what to save. The main limitation is that secondary figures (loyalists, council) remain thematic forces rather than dramatized relationships under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motive and wound (fleeing home, burying the naming gift after grief) are concrete and consistently drive each choice, especially the willingness to “seed” the stone with a painful memory. Interiority is particular and embodied (“my hands went numb,” “tasting metal”) rather than generic. The internal conflict between yearning for gentler, altered memories and needing the “true curve of home” is present, though it could be sharpened with one sharper moment of hesitation at the climax. The seer is distinct, with soft but pressuring authority that shapes the narrator’s arc without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and particular, and her choices in the maze (rejecting “bright, pitiless logic” to protect the frozen townsfolk) embody a believable internal conflict rather than a tidy epiphany. The prince backstory is efficiently used to load her current dilemma with weight. Her final stance—“learning to move differently”—feels earned by prior micro-choices. The only minor limit is that we see little relational friction on the page beyond the remembered prince.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and particular—guilt over a hidden murder weaponized through art—and her final renunciation of art is credibly earned by her earlier subversive creativity. Interiority is implicit rather than explicit, but her choices under pressure (sneaking back, fracturing the name, refusing blood payment) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Jalen and the elders are sketched economically yet function as real pressures, not props. The only limiting factor is a slight emotional underdevelopment of the immediate, embodied cost when she loses color perception.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lysa’s characterization is rich and specific: her mix of technical competence, guilt, and the misbelief that “alchemy was control instead of surrender” underpins every choice. The navigator’s keys, her brother’s failed cure, and her reliance on narration all reveal a coherent inner life under pressure. Contradictory impulses—control vs. surrender, self-punishment vs. self-forgiveness—are present and resolved credibly by the end. The only thing holding this just shy of the very top tier is that the emotional turn toward forgiveness lands very cleanly, bordering on tidy, rather than catching on lingering resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s motivation and flaw—his “intimately aloof” distance masking fear—are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized from the cracked mirror through the cave confession. The internal conflict between aesthetic distance and emotional risk runs through his choices, especially whether to just leave the shell or to speak aloud. The final renunciation (promising to accept “imperfect hands”) feels earned by the prior interiority. A slight tendency to phrase insight in neat abstractions (“the distance was not dignity but fear”) keeps this just short of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to prove a philosophy of communication and reach Jonas—is clear, specific, and consistently drives choices. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (“my hands shook with a softer kind of thunder,” “screaming tenderness”), and the vulnerability of whispering a single honest sentence feels earned. The relationship with Jonas functions as a crucible: his arrival and shame about the foghorn retroactively sharpen the earlier need for proof. Jonas’s shift happens quickly but remains credible within the fable-like, magical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s patchwork identity, loyalty to a dead station, and ambivalence about the midnight caller make for a specific, felt interior life. Motivation—to guide people back through altered terrain—is clear and consistently pressures choices (staying, improvising the armillary, setting out to the aqueduct). Sera and the boy are sketched efficiently yet land as individuals, with Sera’s “half prayer, half wound opening” moment especially strong. The main limitation is that the narrator’s own deeper contradictions and costs (beyond duty) remain more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and particular: a “rational truffle forager” whose involuntary truth-telling is both wound and weapon, and whose final choice to embrace secrecy feels credibly earned. Her motives (protecting psychological safety vs her compulsion to speak) are clear and drive each major decision. The internal conflict is present in scene—especially in the exchanges with Lio and the captain—though a touch more embodied fear or dissonance in the Ministry scene could deepen it further. Lio is lightly sketched but functional as foil and pressure rather than mere prop.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eamon is sharply and economically drawn—his boutonniere, solitary vocation, and investigative method all cohere into a specific, motivated person whose actions drive the story. The narrator is less individuated but functions well as a witnessing consciousness whose skepticism yields to participation. Eamon’s mix of competency and damage (his self-imposed role as “keeper of other people’s missing parts”) gives the closing realization credible weight. The only thing holding this back from the very top tier is that the narrator’s own internal contradiction and cost remain relatively faint compared to Eamon’s.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is sharply drawn through her empirically intuitive habits—trusting measurements yet following ants—so her final choice feels like a credible culmination rather than a contrived epiphany. The anger and recognition with Ellis (“the lonely part of her recognized the same fear in him”) gives their relationship texture in very little space. Her choice to abandon both Ellis and her father’s debts is a genuine renunciation with visible cost, not a painless self-actualization. A minor limitation is that we glimpse her loneliness more in statement than in dramatized prior compromises, so the internal tug at the climax could bear one more specific contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maelin’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally consistent: her disenchantment with awe and menace makes the final refusal of seduction by “stolen stars” feel earned. Her motives (exhaustion with prophecy, need to confront the dreams) cleanly drive each choice, and her relationship with Rovan sharpens her status and temperament without overshadowing her. The internal conflict between temptation and weariness is delicately handled in the ember-ring negotiation. A minor limitation is that Rovan remains somewhat functional; his own tension or cost is comparatively thin.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s blend of idealism, craft-pride, and reluctance to commodify his work feels specific and drives every choice, from pricing his suns in “gratitude” to staging a public, aesthetic protest. The former master/apprentice dynamic with Toma is nicely inverted—Toma now brings pressure and risk, and their shared history charges the alliance. Internal conflict between loyalty to his values, loyalty to Toma, and real-world consequences is present in the “price” passages without being over-explained. A slight limitation is that Toma’s own inner struggle is only lightly sketched; he’s persuasive and sympathetic but a little less dimensional than Lio.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—jealousy of past selves, “feral nostalgia,” and the way he weaponizes envy as a coping mechanism all feel psychologically specific and credible. His profession, fears, and tactics (lucid dreaming, meticulous recording) cohere into a strong character logic. The final shift from jealousy to gratitude and authorship is earned by what we’ve seen of his flaws and habits. The cost—surrendering the fantasy of ignorance/youth and accepting ongoing, conscious witness—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iris is sharply realized—her loss of smell, compensatory visual reading, and gentle decisiveness feel specific and lived-in, and her choice to deliver the screw herself tracks cleanly from that interior. Aster and the father are efficiently sketched in embodied detail (trembling fingers, rigid posture) that reveals their fears without exposition. The main limitation is that Iris’s internal contradiction—grief over her lost vocation versus a new role—is more implied than dramatized under acute pressure, so her growth comes through as a graceful continuation rather than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ila’s motivation—to transform the shame of her scars into something legible and valuable—is clear from the outset and governs every choice, especially adding the fourth circle and inscribing her arm. Interiority is concrete and specific (the remembered weight of her brother, the quill, the blisters) rather than generic. The internal contradiction between fear of repetition (lightning/roof collapse) and the need to act under storm pressure plays convincingly in scene. The change at the end—letting go of shame, choosing to write her own history—feels earned rather than declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marin’s dual identity (gossip columnist and exorcist) is sharply drawn and tightly linked to her guilt, with specific, character-particular metaphors (“A rumor is a nail…”) revealing both her mind and flaw. Her motivation—to repair reputational harm and quiet a haunting—is clear and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to write the correction, knowing it won’t save every tree, feels earned and costly. If anything, the piece could show a touch more in-the-moment hesitation or sabotage before she commits to the apology.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to resolve contradictions and unravel illusions after the “end of history”—is clear and consistently pursued through concrete micro-choices (descending the well, engaging the mirrors, stepping into the spiral’s center). Interiority is strong and particular, with “wanderingly exact” capturing a distinctive mental discipline rather than generic reflection. The main limitation is that internal conflict is more thematic than sharply dramatized; competing impulses (comforting illusion vs painful honesty) are implied but rarely clash in a specific, pressured moment. The closing sense of duty is earned but the cost of that stance could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ivar’s interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (“what clocks really measure…small human fear between ticks”) and his actions under pressure—the ice repair, the deliberate mis-setting of the mantle clock, the way he handles the inspector—track cleanly with his philosophy. The drive toward understanding time vs. fulfilling institutional duty is present, though the internal conflict could bite a bit harder at the climax. His counting backwards and “speaking to pipes like sheep” give embodied texture rather than just quirky labels. The closure choice (keeping the mantle clock wrong) is motivated and carries a quiet but legible cost in terms of professional risk and unresolved doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s characterization is rich and specific: her spatial giftedness, dual jobs, and ambivalence toward security versus exchange all feed directly into her choices. The internal conflict between loyalty to the farm and responsibility to the clinics is credible and sharpened by the “physics of letting go” motif. Her final decision to send the logs feels earned by prior suspicion and tinkering with the system. The auditors are thinner but function effectively as precise external pressure rather than generic exposers.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The daughter’s interiority is rich and specific—her mix of analytic training, dutifulness, and “theoretically rebellious” streak feels credible and drives each micro-choice (taking the lantern, following the scrawls, curating the exhibit). Her father is mostly mediated through artifacts until the end, but the final bedside scene uses his emptied hands and one line of dialogue to quietly reconfigure their relationship. The emotional shift from wanting to “understand what he had been chasing” to curating his contradictions as a cautionary lesson is well earned. A tiny weakness is that her realization about his intent (“not a relapse plan but a lesson aimed at me”) comes as a clean inference rather than a more conflicted, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation and contradictions are finely drawn: she believes in “cultivated estrangement” yet longs enough for contact to finally break her own rule. Her history with Lena is efficiently sketched but feels emotionally real, and the way she handles the wrong-number caller shows her values under pressure. The final choice to use the forbidden dial-out key is fully earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. If anything, her emotional degradation under stress remains a touch too composed and lyric, but it still feels character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s vocation, guilt, and belief in “small moments” create a coherent, particular psychology whose motives clearly drive each choice, from rewriting the preface to confronting the mayor. The internal conflict between her prior complicity (declaring Jun an accident) and her professional ethic lands cleanly in the climax and closure. Emotions are mostly embodied through concrete perceptions—walnut tannins, wet planks, the locket in her hand—rather than abstract labels. A hairline shortcoming is that her fear and potential personal risk in defying the council stay more implied than directly pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara and the narrator are sharply etched in very few strokes—“desperately jocular,” “you look terrible, so you must be serious,” the silent need under her competence—and their motives are consistent and rich. The narrator’s arc from seeking an object-cure to participating in reciprocal care is clear and earned. Internal contradiction is present (the narrator can move aid but not themselves; Mara hides her own need behind logistics and jokes), though it could be shaded even more under direct pressure. The final choice—to walk Mara home as company and return the rock—feels motivated and carries a legible emotional cost (relinquishing a private cure for a shared, ongoing obligation).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iris’s motives are vivid and specific—mapping as a response to her brother’s death and a means to “navigate uncharted emotional depths” gives her a coherent, particular drive. Her competence (blind cartographer, skin-reading) is balanced with genuine vulnerability when she confronts the observatory stone and her brother’s “grammar of heartbeats.” The final acceptance at the pool (“you can miss him and still live”) feels earned by prior choices and pain. The only limit is that contradictory impulses (desire for numbness vs. willingness to feel) are more implied than directly dramatized in on-page micro-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and coherent: her mix of guilt, professional rigor, and “confident uncertainty” credibly drives both her restraint with the pen and her eventual choice to alter the courier interaction. The link from her gardening error to her meticulous, relational approach to revision is well-motivated. The final choice—to edit via a small kindness rather than erase the vines—feels earned, with the cost being her loosening of certainty about cause and effect. Embodied emotion is present but could lean a bit more into sensory/physical response under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s emptiness, fear of erasure, and attachment to the camera and father are rendered through concrete, idiosyncratic actions, not labels, and Aster is a distinct, pressure-applying presence rather than a prop. Motivation (to be remembered, to turn silence into something shareable) is clear from the first paragraph and deepens via the foghorn crisis and the father memory. The final renunciation—leaving the camera on the rail—reads as an earned, costly shift from hoarding emptiness to offering connection. Internal contradiction (wanting to be seen yet apologizing, fearing attention yet seeking it) is present, though it could be fractionally sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sera’s motives and contradictions (protector-arsonist vs would-be archivist/lover) are sharply rendered and drive every choice, especially the final pivot from burning libraries to broadcasting truth. Her interior conflict is embodied (“blistered hands that still wanted to hold someone gently”) rather than labeled, and the shame around her reputation credibly haunts the archive scenes. The relationship with Miko, though entirely off-page, feels specific and is effectively dramatized through artifacts and code. The “analytically intuitive” label is a touch on-the-nose but remains supported by her behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator and Sato are sharply etched, with motives that interlock and intensify—her secret grief-engine against his covert resurrection plan. Interiority is concrete and particular (“signed in ink and saline,” “quietly rebellious”) and actions track cleanly from those motives. Their relationship meaningfully shifts from doctor/subject to co-conspirators in mourning. The final choice to keep returning to the garden reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat insight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and particular—her folded maps, auditory sensitivity, and protectiveness over the maze feel lived-in, and her choices under pressure (risking her secret conduit, orchestrating rescue) track cleanly with those traits. Her interiority is mostly implicit in action and perception rather than explicit thought, but that restraint suits the tempo and avoids stock phrasing. The relationship with Len has clear status dynamics (skeptical authority vs expert maintainer) that shift meaningfully when he concedes and signs. The change at the end—her quiet system becoming sanctioned, with its attendant responsibility—reads as earned and carries a subtle, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The girl’s guilt, hesitation, and eventual confession are sharply motivated and embodied (the mirror, the bitten lip, the blood in the rain), and the guardian’s “silent empathy” is enacted rather than told. Their relationship is a clear crucible: his refusal to interrogate her forces her to step into full responsibility. Internal contradiction is strong in the girl (guide vs. betrayer; helper vs. accomplice), and her final choice to tell everything feels earned by the star-in-eye image. The only slight limitation is that the guardian remains archetypal—effective, but with less visible inner fracture than the girl.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s characterization is vivid and specific—the quiet, listening coach whose rebellion mirrors his chess philosophy—and his motives are clear and consistent from first paragraph to last. His gentleness shaping both tactic and ethic (“how to lose gently,” “humble rebellion”) is strongly dramatized. Internal contradiction (desire to act vs refusal to shout) is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply fought through on the page. Secondary characters (students, mayor) are functional but not deeply individuated, though the mayor’s remembered connection to the grove gives her just enough dimensionality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the dock worker’s competence, suppressed longing for the sea, and moral stance against chaining the island are all clear and consistent. Rusk in particular gains depth through his conflict between duty and love, culminating in his choice to help unchain the island and let his daughter go. The narrator’s own final decision to leave the docks is well motivated but her internal struggle could be shaded with one more moment of real hesitation or irrational fear to feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, numbness, and contradictory desire for “lightness without lying” are sharply rendered, and her choice to keep Orin despite his confession feels earned and morally alive. Orin’s mix of professional affect, guilt, and competence with “sharper work than art” makes him more than a device. Micro-choices—posting the notice, allowing the narration of chores, taking the bouquet outside—track a believable emotional progression. The only slight limitation is that we don’t see their relationship truly strain under pressure; everything moves in one persuasive but mostly cooperative direction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—using paraphrase and the colonnade to erase the fence between herself and her dead brother—is vivid, specific, and drives concrete actions (reversing the decree, recarving the pillars, the final crossing). Her interiority feels particular (“to make grief look symmetrical,” “truth…like a moth settling on a lantern”), and the desire to dissolve self-boundaries is both flaw and engine. The tension between her reverent upbringing and her boundary-striding impulse is implicit rather than fully dramatized in a head-on moment of doubt, which slightly softens the felt cost of her choice. Soren functions well as principled resistance, but his own turn or loss remains underdeveloped compared to hers.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara and Joren are sharply etched with distinct drives—her quietly strategic kindness, his addiction to awakenings and fear of emptiness—and every beat of the negotiation arises cleanly from those traits. The portrait scene, where she weaponizes imperfection without cruelty, is a particularly strong character revelation. Internal contradiction is more layered in Joren than in Mara, whose inner conflict (ethics vs. need) remains somewhat under-articulated on the page. The final choice—Joren’s vow to stop buying awakenings and shared star-memory—feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethic (“ring truths without shattering hands”), and curiosity about “the texture of connection” give them a specific, coherent psychology that drives each choice. Mara is sketched efficiently as a competent, conflicted engineer whose fear of hollowness and willingness to doctor reports create plausible tension. Their relationship evolves from suspicion to collaboration under ethical pressure, and the final choice to reveal the raw archive feels motivated. A touch more embodied, contradictory emotion—especially around the risk to Mara’s career—would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s grief, guilt, and tentative resurgence of purpose are rendered with concrete, particularized interiority (the pendants as coffins, the jar of salt, the “old hunger for oblivion” loosening). Her choices—agreeing to Sen’s method, making the ring, stepping into the curtains, then committing to leaving more birds—track cleanly from these wounds and wants. Internal contradiction (distrust of purpose vs. need to keep light from harm, desire for oblivion vs. impulse to guide others) is active on the page and informs her arc. Lysa is sketched but still functions as a pressure point and mirror rather than a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator, Aurel, and the grandmother (in absentia) all feel particular and textured, with clear motives: honoring an inheritance, wrestling with the ethics of using pattern-knowledge, and documenting cultural response to collapse. The “steadily curious, not brave” self-description nicely shades the narrator, but internal contradiction under pressure is fairly mild—there’s little on-page cost to their choices. Aurel’s shame over steering traders is strong characterization and ties directly to his actions now. The final promise to publish for kitchens and muralists as well as scholars gives a credible, earned shift in the narrator’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s hunger for forbidden knowledge, fear of nostalgia’s contagion, and moral hesitation play against each other in scene, especially when she “should have stopped” yet continues for the answer about why Keth erased itself. Her internal texture is specific (childhood orchard scent, pulled-tooth joy, inherited dread) rather than generic. The final renunciation—telling the elders only that she purified the shelves while secretly altering how the city will read—feels earned and carries cost. Relationship pressure from the elders is present but mostly gestural, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives—regret for the lost valley, reverence for dusk, and a principled refusal to erase “wounded” hope—are clear and consistently expressed in her choices (refusing to purge, investigating, offering her unshared dusk and true name). Interiority is specific and embodied through the stone and her dusk-attuned perception rather than abstract labels. The closing choice to give the shadow weight and teach patrons the anchoring rite feels earned, with a visible cost in exposing her private memories. The one limit is that her internal conflict rarely spikes into real dilemma; she makes the “right” compassionate choice without much on-page struggle or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interior conflict between rage, shame, and an almost stubborn compassion is rendered with specific, grounded detail, especially in the chalkboard “Boundaries / Mercy” moment and the phone call. Her choices follow clearly from established traits—gentle handler, principled, a little idealistic—without feeling schematic. The forgiveness is perhaps slightly tidy for the scale of the betrayal, but her insistence on filing the report keeps it honest. Tessa is sketched efficiently and credibly via her confession, giving the relationship just enough pressure to matter.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s interiority is specific, embodied, and coherent with the premise: a “closure seeker who opens wounds” is not only named but enacted when she deliberately worsens her stitches so “the scar can speak in real time.” Her motives and contradictions (need for meaning vs. self-harm, satisfaction and dread at the seam) are dramatized through concrete micro-choices. The final shift—understanding closure as return rather than lid—feels earned by the preceding acts of damaging herself to understand. I see no unmotivated turns; if anything, her willingness to pay physical cost is admirably unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—officially doing a reading, secretly hunting where “unused love is stored”—is clear and threads the whole piece, and her final act of reading her own letters into the light feels like a psychologically earned risk. The interiority is vivid and character-specific (“burglar of light,” mapping the booth as a universe), not generic. Internal conflict is present but quiet: she is both working a job and covertly using it to solve her private obsession, with that contradiction culminating in the choice to use Eli’s vault for her own letters. The cost is subtle but present: she relinquishes the safety of “letters to no one” in favor of an implied delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sel’s motivation—to restore stolen stardust and free the city’s creativity—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from the nights of watching meteors to opening the vault. Interiority is particular and embodied (tasting grit on the tongue, hearing pressure instead of words), and the sensory filter feels unique to Sel. However, internal contradiction is minimal; Sel rarely wavers or pays a deep emotional price beyond exhaustion, so the arc feels more steadfast than conflicted. The final endurance under the arch reads as earned but not sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guard’s motivation—to “cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners of ruined things”—is clear and consistently borne out by choices (charming the clock, rerouting the crate, nursing the bloom). The internal contradiction between being a company guard and a protector of divergent hope is strong, though it stays mostly conceptual rather than fully embodied in moment-to-moment emotion. Letting the wave functions “split me, step by step” is an effective, costly character move that earns the ending stance. Emotional texture skews abstract, so we feel ideas more vividly than bodily fear or longing.

    The narrator’s motives and flaws are sharply articulated—“stray philosopher, paid in leftovers and questions” is character in a line—and their need for external verification is dramatized through scenes like the clockwork orchids. Internal conflict between wanting certainty/applause and wanting the “wild frontier” is embedded in the forest’s trials and paid off in the cathedral when they consciously loosen the belief “I was only what others could verify.” The final choice to turn the crank and let the gear click home reads as a believable, earned shift with a visible cost in relinquishing that old argument. If anything, moments of resistance could be slightly more dramatized; the character tends to accept each ordeal with high composure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s fear, shame, and gradual accessing of “unused courage” are concretely embodied (burning lungs, shaking hands, choosing the darkest descent), and the final shift to holding the leash loosely feels earned. The guides are archetypal yet distinct in function and demeanor, and their pressure on her is consistently gentle but firm. Internal conflict—between panicked running and staying awake to signs—operates in scene rather than as abstraction. The only limit at this scale is that Mara’s flaws and history are sketched more suggestively than deeply interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bellhop’s conflict between obedience to the REMAIN order and compassion for Edda is sharply drawn and governs every choice. Interiority is specific (“cost of safety like cold metal under my tongue”), not generic, and his discovery of the surveillance core deepens rather than resolves his ambivalence. The final refusal to enforce “unpardonable silence” with Edda, while still protecting her, reads as an Earned Stasis with real cost. Edda herself is sketched efficiently but persuasively as both vulnerable and defiant.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orun’s motivation and core trait set (archivist, titan, regally unpretentious) are vivid and consistent, and his refusal of the crown is cleanly motivated by what we’ve seen. However, his interiority is mostly implied rather than dramatized—there’s little on-page contradiction or moment-to-moment emotional texture under pressure. His flaw set and blind spots are elegant but under-explored; he rarely struggles or doubts. The relationship with the court and queen is handled almost entirely in summary, so we don’t see relational pressure acting on him directly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives are clear and organically rooted in her history as a coral bleaching witness, and her shift from measuring to guarding knowledge feels earned. The internal tension between scientific transparency and ecological secrecy is present, if understated. Micro-choices—taking the skiff into fog, deciding to encode the schedule in taps—credibly reveal her hierarchy of values. A slightly deeper embodied sense of her guilt/complicity at the end could move this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilya is sharply drawn—barefoot, “awkwardly confident,” loyal to Sael, determined to wring meaning from wreckage—and her choices (to investigate the stones, decode the hum, send the message, not hide at the end) feel rooted in those traits. The internal tension between her uncertainty (“pretend she understood”) and her commitment is present but could be sharpened into more explicit, simultaneous contradiction under peak pressure. Her emotional reactions are mostly embodied and particular (teeth singing, shaking hands), avoiding stock affect. The final stance—choosing to stand openly on the stones when footsteps approach—reads as an earned crystallization of her earlier impulses rather than a swerve.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nara and the narrator both feel specific and textured, with motives rooted in concrete history: Nara’s crystal and insurgency, the narrator’s plant-telepathy and loyalty. Nara’s choice to risk opening the relic while trying to overwrite destiny is well-motivated and follows from those traits. The relationship dynamic—grandmother as revolutionary mentor, grandchild as emerging counterweight—is sharp and carries emotional charge. The main limitation is that the narrator’s own internal conflict at the moment of unsealing is more implied than fully dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mina’s characterization is rich and specific: her trauma, linguistic aptitude, and deliberate choice to work at the arboretum all converge under pressure. Her body’s reactions and her “pearl of stillness” strategy create a concrete, contradictory inner life (pulled between avoidance and deliberate exposure). The interaction with Dr. Harlow lets flaws and resilience surface without sentimentality. Her final choice to stay, bury the photo, and “keep growing in public” feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives (terror at fragmentation, longing for her sister, craving control vs. acceptance of fracture) are clear and consistently dramatized through micro-choices like descending with the Tower card and choosing to “accept fracture” in the portrait. Her interiority is specific and embodied, filtered through painterly and tactile perception. The arc from trying to force reality to behave to working with necessary darkness feels earned and forecloses the fantasy of neat restoration. Slight limitation: the sister relationship is powerful but mostly off-page, so its emotional cost has to work through images rather than direct interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Keir’s interiority is vivid and particular—“consciously wild,” with “serene anger”—and his choices (stepping into the ink, attacking the obelisk, relying on data over testimony) are clearly motivated by that temperament. The contradiction between instinct and discipline is dramatized rather than summarized. Emotional embodiment is mostly concrete (e.g., “someone else’s fingers on his pulse”), with minimal reliance on labels. The arc from angry curiosity to steadier resolve is believable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s internal conflict between protecting Mara and exposing corruption is sharply drawn and credibly escalates into a risky, value-driven choice. Interiority is specific (“ink could bloom into rumor,” “my hands shook”) and anchored in her professional habits and family history. Mara, though mostly off-page, gains texture through memory and her final, politically dangerous question. The only soft spot is the Censor, who functions more as a device than a fully-realized personality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maris is sharply etched as the pacifist daughter of a violent man, with her values dramatized through concrete actions (training roses, hiding Lio, disarming Tarek) rather than labels. Tarek’s shift from bounty-focused hunter to protector and planter is motivated by prior beats—the talisman, the dome’s calm, the roses’ behavior—though his change comes a touch easily. The relationship dynamic is clear and functions as the crucible for every major decision. Emotional experience is mostly embodied in behavior and environment rather than overt interiority, but it feels character-specific and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rovan’s motivation (to catch Sileth’s echo) is clear and consistent, and his cool-headedness is shown through measured tactics, not labels. The final renunciation—letting the spike fall—is well motivated by his realization that the echo is a warning rather than a prize. What’s missing at elite level is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses in-scene; his internal struggle at the decision point is implied more than dramatized. Mera is effective as a pressure source but remains mostly a function rather than a fully pressured relationship on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Celeste’s motivation (truth-seeking colliding with inherited guilt) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to protect the observatory while forcing honesty feels earned from the father backstory and her cautious skepticism. Her interiority is specific—treating headlines like planets, carrying the nib as an ethical talisman—and we see contradiction in her desire both to expose and to spare. Sato’s guilt is compact but credible, grounded in the damaged lens and lost colleague. The only limitation is that her emotional cost at the end is more implied than viscerally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s guilt is particular, embodied, and convincingly rooted in the meteor-chasing backstory and his work as a constellation tattooist. His decision to follow the letters, tether the translator, and finally speak the apology are all well-motivated by that long-carrying failure. The internal contradiction—his devotion to mapping other people’s skies versus his avoidance of the one night that matters—is strong, though his emotional degradation under peak stress could be deepened slightly. Dr Sato functions more as a thematic guide than a fully pressured character, but that fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Inez’s motivation (seeking meaning amid enforced forgetting) is clear and drives every choice, especially her decision to intervene by redirecting the proverb rather than opposing the ritual head-on. Her whimsical/artistic nature and social perceptiveness are shown in action (chalk birds, sand mandala, noticing hesitations) rather than told. The teacher and boy are sketched efficiently as pressure sources and foils, with the teacher’s brittle control and the boy’s slip humanizing the system. Emotional embodiment could be a touch more textured under peak pressure, but the internal logic of her final stance feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Samir’s characterization as a “gentle radical” with a mason’s hands and an iron empathy-frame is vivid, and his choices (using retrocognition for mercy, insisting on the Grasp) feel deeply rooted in that nature. Lina’s conflict—seeing her cousin as both killer and coerced boy—is sharply drawn and her eventual decision to bring him to Samir is psychologically credible. Interiority is mostly embedded in action and image rather than abstract labels, which keeps emotions embodied. The main limitation is that Samir’s internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see him waver under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply drawn through her synesthesia, economic anxiety, and attachment to the theater, and her actions (keeping the coin, staying late, agreeing to complete the trick) all flow cleanly from those traits. Silas’s motive—wanting one last bow to mend time—is simple but credible and not merely egotistical. The internal conflict is present but relatively soft: Mara’s “brink of despair” and complicated nostalgia are more stated than rigorously tested in-scene. The final shift from ache to “direction” is earned, though the cost could be edged into slightly sharper relief.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” nature is sharply realized and drives every choice, from dismissing mind-reading to building an empirical protocol that still honors people’s fear. Her conflict between skepticism and care feels lived-in rather than schematic, especially when she hugs the recall lawyer while refusing him. Jory is sketched efficiently but not thin; the burn marks and tingling map ground his desperation. The final stance—that belief in telepathy is less important than listening for paths—feels earned by prior behavior, not tacked-on revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mina’s vocation, sensorial habits, and relationship to the fossil create a distinct, coherent personality with clear motives (“map what sleep would not,” “become the voice of the unknown”). Her fear vs. curiosity conflict is implied in her following the leaf into the darker crack, and there is a real though understated cost in relinquishing the fossil. However, the internal contradiction could be sharpened—her emotional struggle over giving up the transitional object is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. The piece stops just short of a fully felt renunciation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s motivation—to reclaim the prophecy for the workers—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete tactics (cataloging buttons, orchestrating the jar sessions, timing the final release). Her interiority is implied more through actions and metaphors than direct thought, but still feels particular and lived-in. Internal contradiction (fear vs. desire, doubt vs. conviction) is more thematic than moment-to-moment, which slightly softens peak-pressure nuance. The foreman is flatly functional as an antagonist, giving stakes but not much character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rina’s motivation—to mend herself and the service after a morally costly betrayal—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through concrete micro-choices (refusing the pension, filling the pillbox with tools, choosing to help Elsi). Interiority is economical but character-particular, especially in the line “a reminder that betrayal and mending can be neighbors.” The relationship with Tomas carries a lived history without over-explaining, and his non-accusatory “You came back” effectively reframes her arc in relational terms. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that we see less contradictory impulse under peak pressure in the cave scene; Rina’s choices feel somewhat resolved rather than actively conflicted in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rowan is textured and specific—his grief, professional attentiveness, and insistence on stripping the promise “to its essence” all align into a coherent, pressure-tested character. His micro-choices (using the yarn needle, setting terms for Senn, refusing thanks) feel earned and reveal values. The Rowan–Senn dynamic has clear status history and moral asymmetry, though Senn’s confession comes somewhat quickly and lacks much contradictory impulse on his side. Internal conflict in Rowan (love vs. anger vs. need) is present but could surface more explicitly in-scene rather than mostly in closing reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Galen’s characterization as a zen, craft-minded observer whose instincts are gentle but incisive is vivid and consistent, and his choices (testing shadows, using the lantern, refusing to “break” the oasis) clearly emerge from that temperament. Sera’s resentment of the oasis gives him a useful foil and injects emotional pressure. However, Galen’s internal conflict is relatively muted—he rarely feels truly torn between preserving the refuge and releasing it—so the final act, while motivated, carries more conceptual than visceral strain. The emotional cost of collapsing the timelines is more inferred than embodied in his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and believable—her “fear without a task” and the way she translates gardening skills into investigative work feel deeply character-rooted. Her contradiction (timid yet needing something to do with danger) is dramatized in the choice to go to the pier and then in the quieter choice to tend the “stripped canes” afterward. The relationship with Jonas reads as two careful, competent people negotiating trust under pressure without sentimentality. The only limit is that her flaw set (what this pragmatism might cost her emotionally or relationally) is hinted more than it is directly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—fleeing intrusive demands about their past while carrying guilt over an extinct species—is vivid and particular, and every choice (accepting the sundial, going to the circle, copying the script imperfectly) flows cleanly from that. Interiority is specific and embodied (“my stomach tightened”) rather than generic. The internal conflict between wanting to stay unseen and needing to answer an old harm is credible and plays out in action. The final stance shift toward coexistence feels earned by prior beats and carries a felt cost in relinquishing fantasies of resurrection or forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s profession and self-conception as a “keeper of secrets” are used sharply to expose his core flaw—protecting others’ truths while sabotaging his own. The withheld apology to himself is a strong, character-specific contradiction that pays off cleanly when he confesses the sabotage. Arin and Suri are sketched economically yet function as distinct pressures: Suri as an ethical invitation, Arin as an emotional test. The only small gap is a relative lack of embodied, messy physical reaction when Arin appears, which keeps the peak beat slightly more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s mix of professional competence, wary hope, and ethical anxiety is vivid and specific, and her micro-choices (locking the door, rewiring the chain, deciding to misdirect rather than silence or comply) feel motivated. Her internal contradiction—wanting contact but distrusting both humans and the signal—is clear without being over-explained. Secondary characters are sketched through pressures rather than presence but still read as distinct forces. The final stance (asking them to keep broadcasting the shield while the town chooses) feels earned and carries a credible cost in risk and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s fear of enclosure versus need for discovery is vivid and active on the page, shaping every tactic from listening for organ notes to stabbing the compass into mortar. Interiority is specific and embodied (“my lungs tighten,” hands shaking at the end), and the cautious-defiant temperament feels consistent. The mentor is thinner but still functions as a clear relational crucible in the final release. The final choice to “drive the point into the tightest seam” is well-earned by prior traits and costs, giving the character a credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s inner logic—face-blind, obsessively methodical, driven by an ethical/artistic need to make people seen—is precise and consistent, and their choices clearly grow from those traits (“Because I cannot trust recognition, I trust sequence”). Sato and Maren are sketched efficiently through behavior and tells (his oppositional descriptors, her “kindness practiced to a shine,” the broken-glass laugh). The offer to paint the dancers as a bargaining chip nicely crystallizes the narrator’s values under pressure. Maren’s confession arrives a bit quickly and could use one more beat of resistance to feel fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (correcting Elias’s record) is clear and consistent, and her “nervously confident” stance runs through decoding the journals, climbing to the cemetery, and confronting Sato. Interiority is concrete and particular (“spongey” dread, throat full of plans) rather than generic. Internal conflict (fear of being wrong vs need to insist on the truth) is present but could be pushed further in the confrontation and annex scenes. Sato works well as a contained, morally ambiguous pressure, though the relationship dynamic remains relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motive (sister’s fire, legal precarity, attraction to “amnesty”) is vivid and consistent, and their choices (following the clue, using the illegal program on themself) clearly arise from that history. Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than generic. What keeps this out of the very top band is the relative smoothness of the closing decision: we don’t feel much live resistance or contradictory impulse as they choose to erase their old legal identity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives are coherent and layered: inherited outlaw craft, curiosity about loops, loyalty to Mara, and a late-emerging need to re-walk his father’s choices. Interiority is specific and filtered through his robber’s-eye worldview (“never trust a straight promise”). His calm isn’t just told but dramatized in the confrontation on the tracks and in how he handles the startup’s collapse. The final decision to follow the twice-taken route feels earned by prior realizations, though his emotional cost remains more implied than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation (decode before erasure, shoulder part of Nera’s grief) is clear and consistently drives choices, and Nera’s guilt around her brother adds convincing pressure. Interiority is particular and embodied (“a quiet weight settling into the ribs”), not generic. The relationship evolves from professional to mutual witness in a way that feels earned and alters both their roles. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle—this is more about deepening a stance than a sharp internal clash, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thalen’s characterization as a “guarded druid” with “warlike serenity” and the moniker “Finder” is vivid and specific, and his motives (seeking the truth behind mirrors, protecting the conjurer once he understands the curse) are clear and consistent. His choices under pressure—descending alone, choosing to unbend the mirror, sacrificing the seed, and interceding with the guards—directly express his values. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (war-training vs. pacifying, truth-seeking vs. protecting a guilty man) and could be dramatized more sharply in-scene. Emotional embodiment is strong but leans more toward cool competence than messy, pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “purposeful curiosity” versus fear is embodied in specific choices, and her willingness to bleed to repair the seal feels earned. Internal contradiction (anxious elation hardening into resolve) is present but could be deepened with one or two more concrete, character-particular flashes of doubt or selfish impulse under peak pressure. The visionary functions mainly as an archetypal guide rather than a fully pressured character, but that fits the scope. The final reunion with her mother lands as a believable extension of her drive rather than an unearned gift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s characterization is rich and coherent: “fiercely gentle,” willing to mutilate her own future rather than harm others, and this trait drives every major choice. Her refusal to steal a stranger’s destiny and her final offer—“Take my ability to forget pain”—show contradictory impulses (protective love vs. self-erasure) acting at once. Interiority is embedded in perceptions and choices rather than abstract labels. Madam Vey is thinner but functions well as a precise, pressuring foil.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motives and contradictions (using facts as emotional earplugs yet being pulled back into sound and memory) are specific and consistent, and his final reframing of purpose is convincingly earned. Micro-choices—asking to keep the scrap overnight, deciding to dig through invoices, choosing to speak plainly to Marla—track a clear internal progression. Emotions are embodied through acoustic and tactile perceptions rather than labels. The cost (letting go of pure defensive “expertise” as identity) is felt, though the internal conflict could be sharpened slightly earlier under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nerin’s motivation and inner conflict are sharply etched: his need to convert grief into comprehension collides with guilt over valuing “measurements over his sister’s fear.” The contradiction between ambition and care surfaces in micro-choices, especially his decision to let the light pass and write a guide instead of clinging. Emotions are concretely embodied (weight drop, warmth where his sister had been, seed against his fingertips) rather than abstractly labeled. A hairline limitation is that Mara herself never appears on-page in life, so the relationship pressure is necessarily one-sided and slightly idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The librarian’s interiority is rich and particular, with a clear throughline of anxiety about “an ordinary day” contrasted against their meticulous, quasi-priestly role. Motivation—to steward memory and wonder in a world of fluid identity—is consistent and deepens as they build the furnace and ritual. Contradictory impulses (fear of the ordinary vs. devotion to routine, acceptance of others’ shifting selves vs. loss of their own past) are dramatized rather than stated. The final acceptance of the new name reads as an earned stasis rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply drawn through her professional lens and evolving response to the widower; her shift from checking "blast valves and water pumps" to carrying "collected light back to people" feels earned. The widower’s guilt and love for his wife are concisely but effectively rendered, especially around sealing the door on neighbors against her wishes. Emotional conflict is present but somewhat smoothed—her final stance involves little visible struggle on the page. A touch more embodied hesitation at her key decisions would deepen the already strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s guilt, professional rigor, and longing for absolution are rendered with specific, non-generic detail (“punishment feels like waiting for trains that never arrive”). Micro-choices—coming back off medication, following the tunnel, taking the accordion out, sending the annotated photo with their name—feel well-motivated by that tension between duty and avoidance. Internal contradiction is active on the page (insisting they are there “for data” while clearly pursuing penance). The final stance—ongoing self-survey instead of neat absolution—reads as an earned, costly endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The veiled dreamer’s motivation is clear and specific (recovering swallowed sentences, then the unsent letter to his sister), and his “cautious exuberance” feels like a real, coherent temperament. The internal contradiction—wanting to speak without consequence vs. knowing that honesty will cost him—is dramatized through his measured joy in the library and his need to “document everything” to appease the second letter. His final shift, realizing he is the thief of his own voice and mailing the apology, is well earned by the prior pattern of avoidance. A slightly deeper embodied sense of his fear or shame at a peak moment (e.g., touching the codex or posting the letter) would fully maximize the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motives are sharply etched and organically escalating: the bureaucratic task versus the private dream versus the plants’ warnings create a real hierarchy of values that culminates in the sabotage. Her interiority is concrete and character-specific (“mulberry ache,” reading stains, plant sensations) rather than generic. The choice to risk her career and let Sorell take blame is well-prepared by earlier micro-choices (pouring the coffee out, going to the ferns, listening to the figs). The only small limitation is that Sorell remains more function than person, so the emotional weight of sacrificing him is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is specific, competent, and textured—“beautician mortician” grounds her and her ritualized care for Orin feels deeply motivated. Her fear of the “threshold of stillness” and desire to spare her clients cruelty give her a clear, character-rooted drive. What’s missing at this level is sharper on-page contradiction under peak pressure; she never seriously wavers between hoarding and releasing the spark, so the final generosity costs her less dramatically than it could. The relationship with Orin is tender but largely retrospective, limiting live relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific, with her kindly decisiveness shown through pruning, managing the dog, and ultimately assigning her brother to replant the burn scar. The central contradiction—having forgiven yet feeling emptied out—is clear and credibly drives her search. Her shift from seeking contentment as a prize to treating it as cultivation is well motivated by the grotto’s revelations. The only limitation is that we never feel her flaws actively mislead her into a concrete mistake on the page; her growth is smooth rather than hard-won through failure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific: her paid cynicism, tendency toward “sincerely insincere” reassurance, and the way the cloak tightens when she considers selling Sile “the same easy story” all reveal a layered, ethically conflicted psyche. Her final choice to wear the cloak and risk honesty is clearly motivated by established traits and prior experience with enabling cruelty. The relationship with Sile is sketched economically yet functions as a crucible—his fear and dependence pressure her usual professional detachment. If anything, the arc resolves a touch neatly for such a morally fraught job, but it still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior is vivid and particular—his backwards aging, careful speech, and resignation give him density—but the narrator remains more of a receptive lens than a fully conflicted character. His motive to pass the technique on before losing language is strong and believable. However, the internal conflict and emotional cost for the narrator (awe vs. fear vs. loss) could be sharpened, especially at the moment of Lior’s disappearance. The final acceptance of “carrying the truth” feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oren’s motivation—to master stillness-based navigation—remains clear and specific, and his reverence for history and refusal to chase grief give him a distinct interior texture. His micro-choices (climbing the highest tower, appraising the arrowhead before use, waiting rather than leaping after the pulse) track well with that characterization. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: the drive to reach elsewhere without moving versus the discipline of restraint and respect. The emotional cost of his choice (the renunciation of more direct pursuit or bodily movement) could be made a touch more palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Davin’s motivation is clear and specific—his hunger for “the sacred” in a world of automated perfection—and his choices (taking an unsanctioned journey, refusing to show the letter, unstrapping the harness, choosing the childlike ritual) all align with that drive. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hungry heart,” “inkless fingers”), and his flaw—feeling “unimportant”—credibly shapes his decisions. The final renunciation (leaving the keystone, walking past the automaton) feels earned and forecloses an easier path. The only thing holding this back from the very top is that his internal conflict in the climactic moment with the automaton is implied more than sharply dramatized on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistently filtered through the synesthetic quest (“to discover the color of sound”). His micro-choices—keeping the tag, taking the dive, using the tag in the registry, speaking the vow—are all motivated and reveal his values, especially the tension between “hiding behind truth” and reorienting honesty as a lens. The final covenant to keep lighting lamps for others reads as an earned stance shift rather than a neat epiphany. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of this transformation is more conceptual than viscerally felt in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s characterization is textured and specific: a pragmatic mystic whose “quiet enthusiasm” and coin-casting practice make her instantly legible. Her commitment to a hated method under pressure, balanced with lucid doubt about prophecy and ghosts, generates credible internal conflict. The final choice—to spend the station’s remaining fuel in service of a looped purpose—feels earned by prior motives and flaws. Slightly more embodied, sensory emotion under peak stress would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The reaper’s interiority is specific and textured—his grief, professional detachment, and tenderness toward the dead (“even my footsteps keep distance from the lives I take”) all co-exist on the page. Motivation is clear and particular: he needs names and mapped fears in order to survive the emotional cost of his work. His micro-choices (returning to the observatory, setting up the mirrors, deciding to keep the names) all express that drive. The final endurance—leaving still heartbroken but “carrying new names like distant intimacies”—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Evin’s mix of self-effacing competence, mechanical faith in balance, and “brittle devotion” is sharply drawn and governs every choice, from buying the cracked star chart to timing his breath to the drips. His waver under the steward’s laughter gives a real, in-scene test of that brittleness. Emotional states are mostly implied through perception rather than fully embodied, so his internal conflict could be made slightly more visceral. Still, his motives and contradictions clearly earn the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s dual role as warden and narrative custodian is sharply drawn, and her internal conflict between expunging and revealing is clear and particular. The trail from taking the label to speaking at the town meeting feels psychologically motivated and consistent with her history with her father. The relationship with the father is vivid despite being off-stage, especially via the wind chime and his falsified reports. I could imagine a touch more embodied emotional contradiction in the bar and town meeting scenes to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are clear and particular: guild logic versus “touch of wonder,” fear of the council versus secret sentimentality. Her interiority is concrete (jam jars, the scent of rain on stone) and her micro-choices—following the starlings, letting intuition guide stirring—embody her arc. The emotional cost is present but quiet: she risks her professional identity by trusting the irrational-seeming method and her own sentiment. The one limitation is that no on-page relationship presses back against her choices, so her change happens in relative isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to preserve trust even while unmasking deceit—is clear, specific, and consistently drives choices from the first suspicion through the decision not to let the clerk fall. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“touching something that would not lie,” the buckle as a fear-talisman), and the internal conflict between accusation and precision, punishment and protection, is sharply drawn. The final choice to keep listening alone in the arbor, rehearsing breaths and pauses, reads as an earned endurance with cost rather than a neat resolution. A minor limitation is that the dock clerk and Courier Nine remain lightly sketched, functioning more as pressures than fully individuated presences, though that suits the piece’s focus.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s numb clarity, puppet-like self-perception, and desire to “vivify what the rewrites had dulled” create a specific, contradictory psychology that feels credible under this surreal premise. The cost of that clarity—seeing through both factions’ motives yet feeling like an “empty drum”—grounds the final choice to reject both ownership claims. Some moments lean on abstract labeling (“emotional numbness,” “post ego death sight”) rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly blunts the peak beats. Overall, the interior arc from detached witness to co-guardian is well motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s characterization is rich, specific, and consistently tied to her profession and ethics—the escape room designer who thinks in “orthogonal approaches” is a real, particular mind. Her internal conflict between curiosity/ambition (the rare corpse flower, crowds, money) and her drive to protect a fragile creative haven is well sketched, if a bit under-pressured emotionally in the final choice. The OrthoGen representative is thin but functional as a foil, clearly coded as someone testing/control-oriented rather than cartoon-villainous. The final renunciation (“puzzles should open minds, not markets”) is earned, though the felt cost of that stance could be slightly sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Bram’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in concrete loss, and his “mournfully eager” willingness to try superstition feels psychologically plausible. His interiority is embodied through tools and tasks (the pull cord as baton, grinding leaves by hand) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction—skeptical municipal worker vs. desperate ritualist—reads cleanly in his choices. The family is off-page yet sharply rendered as a pressure source, though a single on-page interaction could have deepened the relationship crucible even more.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Both narrator and guardian are sharply etched through specific desires—dimensional homesickness and hunger for certainty—and their choices (waiting, catching his wrist, jointly turning inward) are motivated and in-character. The relationship dynamic evolves credibly from suspicion to fragile alliance, and his confession about guarding thresholds nuances his ferality. Contradictory impulses (yearning to leave vs refusal to trade one certainty for another) are on the page rather than summarized. The only minor limit is that the narrator’s off-page life and flaws are implied rather than textured beyond this central longing, which keeps the arc very focused but a bit narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and threaded through the whole piece, with her “hopeless” alchemy and stoic sensitivity manifesting in concrete choices rather than labels, and Jun’s mini-arc from naive scribe to accomplice adds relational pressure. Her internal conflict—duty versus self-determination—is dramatized in action (breaking/recasting the crozier) rather than mere thought. The admission of shared fear near the end gives their resolve credible cost. If there’s a weakness, it’s that Mara’s flaws (e.g., limits of her obedience, capacity for miscalculation) are mostly implied rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vocation, ethic (“find the beginning in every ending”), and competence are sharply rendered through her choices to reconfigure the system rather than merely record it. Interiority is specific and bound to her work rather than generic, and her final labor with “sore hands and clear inventories” concretizes her values. What’s missing, slightly, is contradictory impulse or more visible doubt under pressure; she moves from intention to execution with minimal emotional friction. That keeps the internal change feeling more like clarified purpose than a hard-won reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lina is sharply drawn through work habits, sensory focus on the ferry, and the practiced nature of her optimism; her professionalism and “resiliently positive” stance feel particular and lived-in. Motivation deepens convincingly from general steadiness to the specific, aching desire “to merge parallel timelines so nobody had to disappear alone.” Internal conflict is present but relatively subtle—her fear and ache are acknowledged more than dramatized in live contradiction, which keeps this just shy of fully maximal. The final workman’s nod between selves is an excellent, character-true cap that rejects sentimentality without going cold.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear throughline from “rational enchantment” to the final surrender to eruption. The desire to measure connection is grounded in sharp biographical detail (father’s death, mother’s remarriage) that shapes choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses—control vs. fever/delirium, math vs. magic—are dramatized rather than told, especially in the mirror/maze sequence. The only small limiter is that the relationship to the curator and child remains more atmospheric than crucible, keeping the conflict mostly intrapersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive and temperament are clear and specific, and her actions (studying the probe, requesting ascent, rewriting curriculum) align tightly with that drive. However, her interior conflict—between communal grief/taboo and curiosity—is more stated than dramatized in scene, so we don’t feel a sharp in-the-moment contradiction. Jae remains more of a functional assistant than a fully pressured character. The final choice to “rewrite the curriculum” is thematically right but occurs at a slight summary distance, reducing its felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s vocation, personal history, and present choices interlock cleanly: her professional calm strains against the reawakened trauma of recognizing the photograph, yet she still chooses to intervene in a way consistent with her ethos (“incidental heroism…looked like showing up at the right breath”). Her interiority is specific and embodied (throat “full of ash,” the hearing aid warming at the end) rather than generic. Eli, though less developed, feels real, with his vulnerability and the way he latches onto the photograph and the voice. The final endurance—continuing to bear her own grief in order to protect others—is credibly earned and carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s mix of professional competence and crippling claustrophobia is sharply embodied (“every breath near a tight hole tried to turn into a shout”), and her loyalty to Ken plus her ethic of “stand[ing] by the unremembered” cleanly motivate her return. Internal conflict is live in the throat-narrowing passage and the phase transition crawl, where she acts despite panic. The endurance at the end (choosing to repair and route Ken’s log rather than just find answers) reads as an earned, costly stance. A slightly sharper on-page moment of tempted retreat could deepen the contradiction even more.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives (escape bureaucratic erasure, seek “midnight solace,” accept Lyle’s lesson) are clean, specific, and consistently enacted through concrete choices like coming to the observatory and agreeing to spill the ink. Her internal conflict between panic (counting heartbeats) and trust (letting Lyle guide her, finally stopping the count) is credible and textured. Lyle’s presence as a digital ghost is sketched efficiently yet distinctly, with his perfectionism/failure history shaping his requests. The only limit at this length is that their relationship’s emotional stakes, while resonant, never quite bite as hard as the conceptual ones.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilen’s motivation—preserving Vey by translating texture into sound—is specific, consistent, and credibly drives all his choices, especially risking the cursed diamond and his body in the tunnel. Interiority comes mostly through action and concept rather than explicit internal conflict, so his fear, grief, and obsession are implied more than embodied. The relationship with Toma is poignant but sketched lightly; Toma functions more as symbol and catalyst than fully pressured counterpart. The final choice to bind himself and the canyon into a “library without pages” feels earned, though the personal emotional cost could be slightly more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara, Jonas, and Edda all feel distinct, with clear motives (research, survival, caretaking) that tangle under pressure, and Mara’s skepticism softening into committed involvement is well earned. Jonas’s desire not to vanish—by becoming either a doorway or a joke—is particularly vivid, and his final choice to offer his bitterness instead of his body feels motivated by earlier beats. Contradictory impulses (Mara’s bitterness vs. duty; Jonas’s dread vs. fascination with the Choir) are present, though they could be pushed one notch further into real-time conflict at the climax. The cost to Jonas—losing the shelter of his bitterness—is legible but could be lingered on a hair more in his body and behavior afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s motivation—to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—is vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices (going “anyway,” using the shell, choosing to play on the tree) all grow from that. The anger at his father’s compromise and his own mix of fear and wonder under pressure give him particularity without resorting to labels. Internal contradiction (aesthetic devotion vs learned anger, fear vs recklessness) is present but not deeply dramatized in on-page hesitation or mistake. The statues are conceptually rich but remain more thematic forces than individuated presences.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ivo is sharply drawn through vocation, method (“linking absences”), and his quietly subversive ethics; Nela is sketched with economical, affecting detail. His choices under pressure—taking guardianship, confronting smugglers, using the bottle, agreeing to cross again—are all consistent and motivated. The internal conflict between duty to councils and duty to people is clear, though it remains mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized in embodied interiority. The final realization about “healing” arises credibly from events, even if phrased a bit abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowan’s motives (silence ruined his life; he now pursues it as possibility) are clear and consistently embodied in his choices, especially taking the “wrong turn” and tending to the damaged horse. His craft identity and sensory experience of silence give him a distinct interior texture without resorting to label-speak. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—he moves fairly smoothly from wound to revaluation—which slightly softens the emotional cost of his final realization. Still, the closing shift toward understanding silence as “craft material” feels earned by the tactile, patient work we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s curiosity, precision, and loneliness are clearly established and consistently motivate her actions, especially her geometric investigation and later choice to guide patrons. Interiority is filtered through her sensory and conceptual focus (geometry, scent, books), which feels character-specific. The shift from solitary seeker to quiet caretaker of others’ stories is credible and rooted in earlier traits, though her internal conflict (comfort in solitude vs hunger for connection) could be dramatized with slightly more friction. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual rather than visceral, but remains convincing for this cerebral character.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mina’s motivation is vivid and particular—being paid “in shells and silence” and obsessively chasing a runaway dream creates a distinctive psyche—and her final renunciation (photographing the absence instead of the returned figure) is well earned. The internal contradiction (clutching the dream as memory vs needing to let it become future) comes into clear focus only near the end, rather than being dramatized in smaller on-page conflicts earlier. Emotions are mostly embedded in action and image rather than labels, which suits the piece’s lyric mode. A touch more embodied hesitation at the doorway moment could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s fear/desire tension is specific and embodied: the red ribbon, the self-cut hair, the seasickness with stars all root her interior conflict in concrete choices. Her motive—to voice an almost-speakable idea—drives each step and culminates in the naming of Altair and the release of her constellations. The locksmith serves as an effective pressure source and midwife rather than a mere exposition machine. The final change (idea freed, fear reconceived as “a careful jailer” that “believes it loves you”) feels earned with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lissa’s motivation (recovering stolen memories) is clear, rooted in her history as a hands-on folklorist, and her habits/curiosity feel particular and embodied. Her choice to break her last habit and eat the mushroom is fully motivated by prior setup. The main limitation is that her internal conflict at the climactic moment (fear vs desire, skepticism vs belief) is implied more than dramatized, so contradiction is present but somewhat underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio and Mara are sharply etched, with clear contradictions—his backward-walking anxiety versus his methodical craft; her pride and snarling bravado overlaying genuine fear. Their motives are concrete and specific (mentoring resilience vs. surviving exile), and choices under pressure—Mara choosing the fearful reflection, Lio reading the EXILE tag “gently and with teeth”—feel earned. The relationship is a real crucible, with status and power shifting as Mara gains agency. The only constraint at this length is limited deeper interior monologue, but what’s implied through gesture and dialogue is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivations are vivid and embodied: the narrator’s fear for Nela and frustration at gray ideas, Soren’s vow to preserve wonder, and how those collide in the confession scene all feel earned. The dynamic between cautious mentor and anxious, inventive apprentice is clear and specific, with Soren’s request for “one thing I feared to give” functioning as a strong relational crucible. Internal contradiction is present—narrator’s insatiable creativity vs. paralysis from worry—but could be sharpened with one more beat of genuine resistance or misstep inside the other world. Soren is slightly idealized, with few visible flaws, which softens the sense of cost in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she’s both a professional restorer and someone bound to the storm-spirit by ancestry and family vows, which makes the choice to break the vow feel earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my hands shook because the air itself seemed to accumulate silence”), with fear, duty, and compassion in genuine tension. The ancestor confrontation could dig one notch deeper into her emotional contradiction in that moment, but the explanation she gives (“vows made of fear keep the dead unmoored”) is grounded in everything we’ve seen her do. The final act of letting the ancestor ground itself through her heartbeat and then into the mask reads as a meaningful, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is specific and coherent—her perceptive, methodical kindness clearly drives her decisions from accepting the archivist’s request to refusing to turn the chapel into an exhibit. The map-framer details feel lived-in and shape how she sees people and objects. Internal conflict is present (skepticism vs. openness to the chapel’s “whisper”), but it rarely pinches hard; her choices don’t cost her much on the page. The archivist is more a functional presence than a pressure-bearing character.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s quietly analytic temperament, grief as equations, and professional competence are all crisply established and consistently dramatized. Her internal conflict—obsessively chasing answers vs. learning to release—is credible and culminates in the choice to let the reel drift. Emotional life is a touch abstracted into concept at times, with relatively little bodily or relational texture beyond Dee. Still, the final stance feels earned and carries a visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s motivations are specific and coherent: he plays where he won’t be heard, yet carries a ghost whose hunger to be heard mirrors his own hidden need. His quietism becomes an earned stance at the end when he chooses to be the carrier “who stayed quiet,” which feels like a costly commitment, not a default. The internal contradiction—wanting witness without commodification—is clearly dramatized but could show a bit more embodied tension under the time pressure. The ghost’s motive (“routing” rather than resurrection) is sharply drawn and dovetails well with Lio’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysa’s motivation—to be more than a “carrier” of other people’s secrets—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from taking the diary to pulling the brake. Her interiority feels lived-in (“old hurt of being seen and still being small”) and the emotional progression from curiosity to fear to charged composure is credible. The captain is sketched vividly through the diary’s habits of noticing joy, giving their relationship a poignant asymmetry despite his physical absence. The only minor limit is that Lysa’s flaws and contradictions (recklessness vs. caution, resentment vs. loyalty) could be pushed a bit harder under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific—her promise to Juno, her sky-taxonomy, and her gamble on “empty spaces remember” all feel grounded in a coherent psyche. The “quietly explosive” description is paid off by her decisive, risky choice to drop the telescope, balancing competence with a streak of near-reckless faith. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in the moment (she moves from resolve to action without much visible hesitation), which trims some potential depth. Still, her motives and values are clear and the final endurance/renunciation (memorializing via data, not sentiment) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s face blindness, tactile pattern-thinking, and reverence for craft are integrated into every choice, from decoding the coin to how she reads the foreman, and they cohere into a distinct interior life. Her emotional progression—anxiety about her cognitive limit to a quiet sense of kinship with the book’s scholars—is subtle but earned. The main weakness is that her internal conflict under pressure is more implied than dramatized; she adapts almost too smoothly, with little on-page wobble or genuinely difficult trade-off. The foreman relationship beat is underused as a crucible; it grazes status dynamics but doesn’t quite force a sharper change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s characterization is vivid and particular—“greeted every silence like a neighbor,” using the phrasebook as a bookmark, talking to instruments—and his curiosity clearly motivates each choice. His loneliness and hunger for discovery are well embodied in his attention to the trapped light and the hopscotch board. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are only lightly touched (defying Yara’s task is mentioned but not really pressured), which keeps the arc from feeling fully crucible-tested at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation (to learn repair to help her father) is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, from opening the door to leaving the original parts. Her guilt over her father and her competence with locks create a credible tension between ease (taking) and the harder, ethical path (making). Interiority is vivid and embodied rather than abstract (“guilt tasted like saltwood”), and backstory is cleanly anchored to present stimuli. The only slight limitation is that her contradictory impulses in the peak choice moment could be dramatized with one more beat of hesitation or temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The collective “we” narrator, Mara, Jai, and Serren are all cleanly sketched with distinct functions and motives, and the shift from suspicion to trust in Serren is credibly grounded in the grave/logs sequence. Motivation (survive, repair, reach respite, avoid being used) is clear and drives choices. Interiority remains somewhat high-level—there’s little moment-to-moment, embodied contradiction under pressure—but the emotional arc from wary survivors to committed builders feels earned. The final promise to keep chalk and bell together reads as a believable evolution rather than a pasted-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s vocation and vow (“whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes”) give her a precise, affecting motivation that cleanly drives every on-page choice, including her final sacrifice. Interiority is embedded in images rather than labels, and her tenderness toward the broken puppet renders her particular, not generic. Internal conflict is mostly implicit (duty vs mercy, clock vs lullaby) rather than dramatized as simultaneous tugs, which keeps this just shy of the very top band. The cost of becoming “a quiet correction” feels fully earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caretaker’s motives and conflicts are clear, specific, and organically revealed: the curse, duty to the orchard, ethical refusal to let travelers die. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“offhandedly exact,” “a dent shaped like mercy”), with choices under pressure (agreeing to help, using the nut, deciding to finish the waystones) feeling earned. The tension between self-preservation (curse tightening) and obligation is present in scene, not just told. The only slight limit is that Mara and the child remain lightly sketched, serving function more than relational transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s guilt, competence, and ethical rigor are sharply drawn, with her scientific thinking and grief constantly interwoven. Her shift from self-punishing isolation to “atoning through use rather than apology” feels fully earned and costly. Internal contradiction—wanting absolution yet resisting it—runs through the piece without being over-explained. The only minor limit is that no other character is on-page to pressure her in real time, so relational crucible is mostly off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s desire to find their own beginning and the pain of erased identity come through in concrete ways (the title-hole recognition, the name that “slid away”). Their choices—accepting Mira’s task, using the moonlight, performing the incision, deciding to leave—track cleanly with that motive. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle; there’s more awe than real resistance, so the crucible never gets quite searing. Mira works functionally as a pressure source but remains more symbolic than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Safi’s characterization is rich, specific, and embodied: his sensory gift, professional pride, and wary tenderness all play directly into his choices. His internal conflict—fear of emotional contagion versus desire to turn pain into “craft”—is implicit but convincing, culminating in the deliberate unwrapping of his hands. The wounded scout anecdote and his interactions with the soldier at the end efficiently show growth from avoidance toward chosen exposure. The only slight limitation is that Jinan’s relationship to him and its pressure remain mostly offstage rather than becoming a live crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is vivid and particular—a “choral librarian” who hears grammar in grain and acts on it—so her motives feel grounded and consistent. Her decisiveness under pressure (organizing night labor, answering Nine in multiple languages) is clear, but we rarely see true internal friction or cost; she moves from intention to success with little doubt or sacrifice. The townspeople and mayor function more as a chorus than as individuated pressure sources, so relationship dynamics stay somewhat abstract. The closing choice to make Nine a public granary and language school is thematically apt but emotionally under-complicated for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nira’s characterization is vivid and particular—“helix-minded engineer” is borne out in her actions, especially the copper helix and methodical labeling of memories. Her internal conflict between “accept the blur” and fiercely cataloguing abandoned dreams is clear and motivates every choice. The realization about her mother and the surgery reconfigures her self-concept in an earned way, shifting her from fearing madness to accepting curatorship, with a discernible cost in confronting what was taken. Secondary characters are off-page but still exert meaningful pressure through remembered scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilya’s motivation is clear and specific—an archivist obsessed with blanks and forgotten combinations—and his choices (accepting the summons, reentering, using the seeds, speaking the combinations aloud) track cleanly with that. Interiority is evocative but mostly conceptual; we don’t feel his fear, doubt, or bodily jeopardy as fully as we could under this pressure. The latent internal contradiction (terror of the grotto vs. archival compulsion) is stated but not richly dramatized in-scene. The ending endurance—carrying the knowledge out and resisting the cave’s pull to forget—lands as an earned stance but could carry more emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lysa’s motivation is clear, specific, and embodied: needing to make “music in a silent world” and reading strain as grief gives her a convincing, particular psychology. Her micro-choices (where to string wires, how to read cracks as intervals, deciding to share the device with neighbors) reveal values around empathy and connection without falling into diagnosis-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—she both accepts the world’s silence and refuses it—which could be pushed a little harder under pressure for maximum impact. The final decision to carry the “portable silence-music” outward is well-earned by what we’ve seen of her, but the cost to her personally is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sable’s ethic of restraint, exile, and teacherly precision are vividly established and consistently drive his choices, from how he experiments with the nexus to how he frames the ultimatum to the council. The interiority is particular (e.g., the worry stone, the posture of an absent tutor) and actions clearly align with his values. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized—his resistance doesn’t falter much—so we don’t fully see contradictory impulses grinding against each other in-scene. Elder Mera is sketched with evocative economy but remains mainly a functionary for the plot rather than a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio is sharply realized: his pacifism, sonic craft, and reverence for silence drive every choice, from refusing to pry the diary to using his resonator instead of force. The internal tension between his ethics (not breaking what another tried to close) and his need to access the diary’s truth is credible and dramatized. Mara, though absent, feels dimensional through his guilt and belated understanding of her “loud art” as love. The emotional shift at the end—from quarrel and blame to complex empathy—lands as earned, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jun’s motives (ambition, craft pride, longing to “brew a quiet that could travel”) are specific and drive every beat, and her arc from acquisitive seeker to steward feels earned through the bloom vigil. Her olfactory sensitivity and journaling habit individualize perception and choice. Internal conflict is present—ambition versus service—but could surface with slightly more friction at the decision to accept the village’s terms, which comes very smoothly. Etsu and the wardens function more as principled gatekeepers than fully pressured relationships, but they do sharpen her values.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s motivation is clear and consistent—from seed rights to the deeper urge to locate “the source of resilience”—and her choices (testing the metal, flying during inversion, relinquishing the arrow tip) all track. Interiority is concise but specific, especially her shift from dismissing the “gathering of echoes” to accepting a collective origin for resilience. The final renunciation of the arrow tip is earned, though the internal conflict between craving a singular miracle and accepting a chorus of choices could be dramatized with slightly more friction on the page. No relationships are on-stage, so we lose the added pressure of human dynamics testing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    The investigator’s professional mindset and methodical drive are clear and consistent, with his motive “not just to assign blame but to cultivate foresight in action” giving him a specific, non-generic lens. His choices under pressure (following the airflow, decoding the latch, then sabotaging the spiral) feel motivated by that identity. Internal contradiction is relatively light—he’s more a cool professional than a mess of impulses—so the arc reads as refinement of an existing trait rather than a deep change. Still, the final insight about foresight feels earned by the concrete tactics we’ve watched him choose.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s motivations (certifying wonder, resisting imposed silence) are clear and consistent, and his synesthetic perceptions give him a distinctive interior life under pressure. His key choices—playing the bells against the sculpted hush, then confronting the Council—feel earned by what we’ve seen of him. Internal contradiction (awe vs. duty vs. fear of fragile reform) is present but could be pushed further on the page, especially around his complicity in the rationing system. Maera’s confession is potent but slightly compressed; her inner life is more told than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in a believable blend of guilt, fear, and duty; her decision to finally play the flute alone undercuts her earlier rigidity in a way that feels earned. The internal contradiction—devotion to guardianship vs. terror of misusing the relic—is dramatized rather than merely stated. The pilgrim is more emblematic than individuated, but his older, non-accusatory stance sharpens her self-indictment effectively. The final redefinition of “guardianship” grows credibly out of the choices we’ve watched her make.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kestrel is sharply defined—profession, quirk of borrowing personalities, and accumulating internal crowding all cohere into a specific, non-generic consciousness. Her motivation evolves plausibly from workmanlike service to experimental curiosity to self-preservation/ethical recalibration. The final renunciation—pouring the borrowed selves into the blank broadside—feels earned by prior costs. The one limitation is that her emotional experience stays mostly conceptual; a touch more embodied, moment-to-moment struggle under pressure would deepen her further.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rook’s nervous compulsion to stay in motion, his devotion to small “impossibilities,” and his unresolved attachment to Nera create a specific, credible psyche whose final choice to “plant” the delivery feels earned. The lamplighter beat and the exchange with Mara both reveal him under pressure, especially when he resists letting go of the pendant. Internal conflict—duty as courier vs. desire to seed wonder—is present but remains relatively gentle rather than sharply agonized. Emotional embodiment is strong but could edge a bit further into visceral texture at the peak decision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Both narrator and Lio feel fully realized in a small space: her hunger for plain answers versus his principled acceptance of ambiguity generates real tension. Her micro-choices—naming “anger,” protesting his certainty, then choosing what to tell her parents—are credibly motivated and show an earned internal shift. Lio’s grounded attentiveness (“boots caked in river clay,” tracking “every fern needle”) coheres with his mystical method and his ethic about proof and care. The only minor limitation is that her contradictory impulses could surface with a touch more bodily disarray under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yara’s motive—send a message to Jun across impossible distance—remains clear and consistent, and her fear of the loom’s price provides credible internal conflict. Her choices (keeping the loom idle, deciding to recommence, surrendering her voice) all align with that motive and reveal a hierarchy of values. The emotional life is mostly conveyed through image and situation rather than explicit interior thought, but it still feels specific and embodied. The final renunciation of speech reads fully earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s meekness and physical strength are crisply established, and his steady, self-eroding choices under the silk feel both inevitable and costly. His anger “shaped…into azure defiance” is a strong crystallizing beat linking temperament to action. Internal conflict—how much of himself he’s willing to lose—is present but could surface more explicitly in moment-to-moment hesitation to reach the very top tier. The magician functions mainly as catalyst, not an active relational crucible, which slightly limits the relational pressure on Lio’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, sensory habits, and guilt make for a distinctive, coherent interiority, and her motive to confront the lie about Jalen is clear and consistent. The bodily sense of “weight on the ribs” grounds the abstract aim of measuring withheld truth. Jalen arrives late but still reads as a specific person through his fury and his line about anchors, though the confrontation compresses quickly past the emotional fallout. A touch more hesitation or conflicting impulse in the final decision would deepen the already-strong arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Noah’s reticence, competence, and quietly protective streak are established from the first line and drive every later choice, especially taking the sea glass and ultimately writing his own anonymous letter. His interiority—“he had never been good at saying what mattered, yet he carried the sea glass”—is concrete and particular rather than generic. The dynamic with Maris is subtle but legible in status and care without explicit statements. The final renunciation of signature reads as an earned extension of his flaw and value system rather than an easy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s mix of mischievous joy and grave responsibility is sharply drawn, especially in the line about feeling “that familiar chill of accident” when a joke becomes prophecy. Her micro-choices—deciding to “choreograph” the flood, preserving old newspapers, steering the beam herself—are consistent with that blend of play and duty. Internal contradiction (loving the laughter that endangers people) is present but could be pushed further under peak pressure. The mayor is thinly sketched, functioning more as a mouthpiece for consequence than as a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maru’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory (watchful controller of color vs. explosive new heart / fear of becoming a “plot hook”), and her micro-choices—going to the tea house, following the map, accepting Sairi’s “practice”—are tightly motivated. Her realization that “stories magnetize toward the hands that make room for other lives” is earned by cumulative encounters with Sairi’s script rather than announced ex nihilo. The relationship with Eno is lightly sketched but functional as a crucible for choice rather than a comfort presence. The final vow forecloses a quieter, safer life and feels like an earned shift rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to understand what trees witness—threads cleanly through their municipal role and choices, culminating in the quiet rebellion of reorienting the labyrinth. Interiority is specific and embodied (“flakes of sleep on door lintels and in the seams of my gloves”) rather than generic. The conflict between duty (keeping measurements “true”) and curiosity about the trees is implied more than directly dramatized, but it still credibly underpins the decisive choice to deconstruct. The cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than concretely repercussive on the page, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysa’s role as a scattered memory keeper with a self-eroding gift is vivid and psychologically rich, and her final stance—choosing her losses with “open eyes”—feels earned. Motivation (rekindling dawn for a dying realm) is clear and coheres with her personal wound around memory. However, most of her conflict is conceptual rather than dramatized in on-page micro-choices under pressure, and Marrow functions more as a mouthpiece than a fully pressuring presence. A bit more in-scene hesitation or contradiction at the loom could sharpen her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marin’s characterization as a compassionate recluse with a history of trauma (his sister’s death) cleanly motivates his choices, from following the “mistake” invitation to handling Lysa gently. His interiority is specific and consistent, especially in how his empathy becomes both burden and compass. Lysa is sketched more lightly but still reads as a distinct, anxious junior caught between loyalty and fear. The final choice—to “stay in the library as himself while leaving the world his name belonged to”—is well earned by the established paradox between visibility and withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mina’s interiority is clear, specific, and morally fraught—her boredom- and grief-trained noticing and later confession about the complaint create a credible, flawed protagonist under pressure. Her motives (resisting erasure, seeking the sacred) are consistent with her micro-choices: keeping the bread, following the note, accepting “tenuous absolution” via work. Sada is sketched efficiently but distinctly, with her pragmatism and gentle testing stance informing how she handles Mina’s guilt. The final choice to kneel and plant seeds feels earned, though a touch more embodied stress or fear could deepen her contradictions in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilian’s motivations—duty, grief for his sister, fear of oblivion—are specific and consistent, and his meticulousness is embodied in actions like double-checking the peaks “because accuracy was the last kindness.” The internal shift from mere recorder to co-witness/participant (whispering his own promise, then vowing to “measure every fading illusion”) feels earned by the page. The tension between professional detachment and personal involvement is present, though the conflict could be sharpened with one moment of real hesitation or cost before he offers his own vow.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, and her competence is believably mixed with habit and unease (“less like bravery and more like habit”). Her micro-choices under pressure (resetting the wax, redirecting after each false start, choosing the cup-clatter) reveal priorities. Internal contradiction—comfort in danger vs. fear for her father—is present but could be pushed slightly harder on the page. Secondary figures are sketched via status and action, not deepened, but that feels appropriate to the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s curiosity, grief, and skepticism are specific and motivating, and the micro-choices (taking the ring, following it out of the city, choosing to join the circle) track cleanly from those traits. Interiority is vivid and particular—“as if the land itself were speaking,” “my ribs hum like an old radio”—without collapsing into labels. The main weakness is that the internal conflict at the climax (risk vs loyalty to grandmother / ethics of joining) resolves very swiftly; a touch more hesitation or cost on the page would deepen the sense of a hard choice. Thundercloud Hair is sketched efficiently but mainly functional, with little relational friction beyond wary acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motives (the compulsion of the numbers, her buried vocation, loyalty and resentment toward her mother) are concrete and consistent, and her key choices—descending, staying, picking the lock, then painting the mural—follow from those motives. Interiority is specific (the joke-rhythm of the numbers, her sense of a “family vocation that would have swallowed her whole”) rather than generic. The internal conflict between honoring her mother’s apparent wish to spare her and answering the “inescapable calling” surfaces, but it never quite bites as hard as it could; she rarely seems genuinely tempted to turn back. The final embrace of the stage/art feels earned, but the visible cost—beyond a poignant understanding—is a bit soft.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation (to locate lost conversations/Lio and to stay honest in a dishonest city) is clear, consistent, and drives each micro-choice, from following the map to writing the plain-paper confession. The interplay between her longing for water and for her brother, and her commitment to candor, gives her a credible internal contradiction. Embodied emotion is present but relatively light—her reactions are more conceptual than visceral—which keeps this just shy of the very top band. The final choice to go to Lio with “one clean question” is well-earned by the prior beats and feels like a real, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysa’s professional specificity and values are vividly clear through her actions—tuning, building, refusing standardization—so motivation never feels abstract. However, interior conflict is mostly implied; we don’t see her wrestle in-the-moment with fear, doubt, or competing impulses, which keeps the emotional arc a bit cooler than the premise allows. The Auditor is effective as a pressure source but reads more as an emblem than a fully individuated person. The ending shows a credible endurance/renunciation (keeping seasonal muteness, refusing replacement), but the personal cost remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    N-3’s motives are clear and particular—protect the roses, obey caretaker code, and quiet the “static”—and his internal conflict between preservation and deliberate harm is sharply dramatized in the choice to start a controlled burn. The nostalgia for absent children is embodied in specific memories and the box, not generic sadness. His final understanding of the box as a “valve” and acceptance of leaving the dome reads as an earned reconfiguration, not a convenient epiphany. The only limit on an even higher score is that his flaw set and blind spots (e.g., overreliance on protocol vs. improvisation) are implied more than explicitly stress-tested across multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive and perceptual habits (curator, listener, non-extractive ethics) are clear and consistently drive her choices, and the neighbors each get a sharp, specific facet. What’s missing at a top-tier level is more live contradiction or cost inside Mara—she never truly wavers between profit and listening, or between intrusion and retreat. The emotional shifts in secondary characters are credible but somewhat rapid, edging toward tidy reconciliation. The final acceptance of the locket feels earned but emotionally smooth, not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s characterization is vivid and particular (hearing “meter in machine noise,” calm defiance, hangman’s dice), and her motives—to free Oren and the others without feeding the council exploitable confessions—are clear and consistent. Her competence under pressure is engaging, and the relationship with Oren plus the history with the guardian add texture. What’s missing at this level is a sharper on-page contradiction or visible internal struggle under peak stress; she never feels close to breaking or morally torn. The final choice costs her risk and effort but not something that forces a deeper reordering of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s motive—to resist “mercy” and recover what was taken—remains clear and intensifies credibly from private hurt (father forgetting her) to civic rebellion. Her professional detail (lantern lighter) and habits (coffee grounds, pressed flowers) particularize her, and her actions align with a grief-driven stubbornness. Internal conflict (wanting her loved ones whole vs. knowing restored grief will hurt them) is implied rather than fully dramatized in the climactic choice, which slightly blunts the felt cost. The relationship with her father lands movingly at the end but could use one earlier, more embodied moment of ambivalence to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motive and internal conflict are clear and specific: protect the present from factional exploitation vs. protect the city from poisoned wells. Her magic is psychologically framed as “summoning attention,” which individualizes her competence. The key choice—suppress, erase, or filter the prophecy—is credibly motivated by what we’ve seen of her values. Emotional texture skews a bit conceptual; more embodied fear or cost in her body would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s desire to understand buildings and to save the Dovetail is consistent and drives every choice, and Ilyas’s role as tutor/neighbor is sharply etched in a few strokes. The bond with the grandmother via Phoenician and the sugar/tea backstory gives their relationship depth without overexplaining. Internal contradiction is relatively light; the narrator’s fear and moral qualms about deceit are implied rather than dramatized in a way that might have added further complexity. Ilyas’s final fading feels emotionally earned but could land harder if the narrator’s attachment and cost were more explicitly conflicted in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation (refusing to lose her brother twice while wanting independence) is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to archive but not erase. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied details like the shell “smooth as bone” and her laugh “too bright for the dim ward.” The internal contradiction—clinging to the shell vs. choosing distance—is dramatized rather than merely stated. Sol is less individuated but functions credibly as a gentle institutional pressure rather than a cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s guilt, conflicted agency, and deep-rooted motive “to forgive the unfinished” are clear and consistent, and her final choice grows credibly from those impulses. Her micro-choices with the quill, the thorn, and the key reveal a hierarchy of values (truth over self-protection, mercy over vengeance). Senn is sketched efficiently with status dynamics and a personal stake in concealment that sharpens when his own treason is exposed. Emotional texture leans slightly summary-abstract at times, but the internal contradiction and endurance under pressure feel specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s motive—to protect Senn’s stolen voice and understand why people echo—is clear, consistent, and drives every major choice, culminating in her counter-song and uniting the shells. Her emotional life is mostly implied through action and image rather than deep interior contradiction; we don’t see much genuine struggle or doubt in the confrontation with Mael. Jaro’s shadow-voice is a strong, specific bit of characterization that also sharpens the moral stakes, while Mael reads more as a functional antagonist than a fully individuated person. The final commitment to “listen for what was missing” is earned but could land harder if we’d seen a sharper internal cost or temptation to compromise earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s vocation, ethics, and investigative habits are clear and consistent, and her final choices (refusing hearsay, confronting Fen publicly, dedicating the globe to remembrance) all read as motivated extensions of those traits. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spoken into her regulator and into her own ribs”), giving her a distinct sensibility rather than a stock “psychic diver.” The main limiting factor is the relative lack of on-page internal contradiction or moral friction—she rarely feels genuinely torn, which slightly flattens emotional complexity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Jiro and Ren are sharply etched with clear, consistent motives: Jiro’s devotion to unseen labor, Ren’s hunger for usefulness and status. Ren’s internal change—from mocking calloused palms to honoring hidden work—is well earned through specific experiences (moonlit mending, seeing currents, catching the runner). Interiority is mostly shown through perception and action rather than labels, and their status dynamic subtly shifts as Ren begins to bow to Jiro. The only limitation is that Ren’s conflict remains relatively clean, with little messy resistance once the mentorship begins.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The debunker’s motives and traits are sharply sketched—skeptical, pattern-driven, stubborn about truth—and her choices (taking the case, riding into the dust, staging the reveal) align cleanly with that. Interiority is specific and consistent, though largely cool and professional, with relatively little embodied emotional contradiction under peak pressure. Salma is efficient but thinly rendered emotionally given the weight of her loss. The final choice to mail the ledger to rival bureaus is well motivated and forecloses safer paths, but its personal cost is more implied than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s interiority is specific—his loneliness, opportunistic “collecting believers,” and oscillation between reason and ritual (“variant allegiance”) feel lived-in and drive his choices, and Mara’s entrance with “weary kindness of someone already half myth” gives her a strong, distinct presence despite limited access. Their relationship shifts credibly from rivalry-at-a-distance to complicity in a shared scheme. The main limitation is that their joint decision to collaborate comes very smoothly, with little dramatized resistance or cost, which softens the sense of hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sato’s motives and contradictions are sharply drawn: he frames taking the music box as “gleaning” while aching for redemption, and his shift from charging coins to asking for stories feels earned. His interiority is specific (the wish to “sweeten sorrow into song,” to be a translator between generations) and actions align with those values. The closing image of him listening to jars “like lanterns” crystallizes a believable, hard-won adjustment of his priorities. The only limit is that we glimpse, rather than inhabit, his most conflicted emotional moments—there’s room for one sharper embodied beat under direct social pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio is sharply defined—profession, temperament, and ethics all come through in concrete ways, especially in his choice to “adapt, not with fists, but by stepping into the rhythm of the dock.” His “logically emotional” nature is shown rather than told through the contrast between tide-table calculation and his response to gulls and grief. The thieves are sketched efficiently, with the glassy-eyed trader gaining unexpected depth via the brother-under-the-floe confession. Internal conflict is relatively muted (Lio never seriously wavers from his duty), which keeps this just short of top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Irena’s impatience-versus-patience conflict is sharply articulated and dramatized, especially when she resists the urge to sabotage the viaduct immediately and instead chooses long observation. Her vocation, temperament, and history with the monastery all align with her tactics and worldview. The final return to “draw a new horizon, patient at last” feels earned rather than declared. The main limitation is that all other characters remain generalized, so relational pressure is more thematic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her occupational mindset—counting details, using sound, logging humidity—so her competence feels real while her fear and moral discomfort run underneath. The tension between career dependence on Kellan and her commitment to preventable deaths is clear and credibly drives her arc. Her decisive choice to send evidence outside, framed against her usual compliance, lands as an earned change with cost. Emotional embodiment stays concrete (wet brick, the lantern’s warmth) rather than abstract labels.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s moral ambivalence, guilt, and institutional caution are precise and compelling, and Lena’s stance is grounded in her history with Mrs. Halden. Contradictory impulses (Elias’s belief in repentance vs. fear of being duped; Mrs. Halden’s refusal to forgive but recognition of “action”) feel earned. Darren is mostly seen through others, but his one quoted line and painstaking work still individualize him. The final shift—Elias reconceiving “second opinions” as openings rather than excuses—follows cleanly from prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s curiosity, skepticism, and irreverence are cleanly drawn and drive every major beat, from secretly studying the arrow tip to literally flying the “patched” glider into the unknown. Her internal contradiction—chemistry vs “moods,” mockery vs ritual, math vs “poetry”—is dramatized rather than told, and her final act of ringing the bell feels like a believable extension of that tension. Emotional embodiment is mostly carried through perception and wit instead of stock feeling labels. The main limitation is that the personal cost of her final choice remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—professional obligation braided with private grief over her vanished mother—is clear, specific, and drives every choice from querying the audit trail to using the forbidden admin account. Her interiority is vivid and particular (“noticing the slips in metadata the way other people notice weather”), and the contradiction between loyalty to Lattice and loyalty to the dead/families is legible. The final choice to seed the truth to families while lying to Legal feels earned by prior beats. Slight limitation: emotional conflict around her mother could be embodied a bit more in-scene rather than primarily summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s role and motives are clear and consistent, and her choices credibly drive the outcome, but she remains more archetype than fully embodied individual. The fisherman and glaciologist’s fears are economically sketched via the mirrors, which works well. Internal contradiction in Mara (her own costs, doubts, or blind spots) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene. The final plan feels earned but somewhat low-friction emotionally, with little sense of what it specifically costs her beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to study endings rather than seek her own—feels original, specific, and consistently drives choices, especially volunteering to escort Signe. Interiority is textured and embodied (“thoughts slid away as if my skull had lost its latch,” the bone tip habit), and her flaws (compulsion to chase endings, temporal dislocation) meaningfully complicate her stance. Signe is sharply sketched in a few strokes, with clear agency and perspective. The quiet internal shift at the end (letting endings “pass”) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator and Mara feel specific and internally coherent, with the sentinel’s mix of reserve and longing nicely dramatized in his decision to invite her up and show his own burned scrap. Their backstories are sketched efficiently through concrete details (city noise vs. vineyards, travel vs. children), and those histories clearly motivate present choices. Internal conflict is present but gentle—there’s less on-page struggle and more readiness to process, which slightly softens the sense of cost. Still, the final endurance/renunciation (keeping the letters intact rather than burning) feels earned by what we’ve learned.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iri’s characterization is precise and distinctive—her peripheral awareness, half-mask, and “strangely honest” uncovered side all manifest in concrete choices, especially the risky bargain to lead the prophet onto the line. The prophet is efficiently but vividly sketched through tiny tells (his gaze, his fingers on the cup, the single quiet tear). Internal conflict is present but understated—duty, suspicion, and kinship in motive are felt more through perception than explicit turmoil, which suits the tone but slightly mutes the sense of struggle. The final alignment of motives (preserving wisdom without owning it) feels earned by their prior interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s vocation, temperament, and grief-saturated attentiveness feel specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (how she asks for certain photo shapes, how she frames the project as a “doorway”) are well-motivated. The piece smartly uses her professional habits (archivist, puzzle-minded) as a lens for how she relates to the town’s trauma. However, her interiority skews idealized and steady; we get little contradictory impulse or visible cost to being the emotional container for everyone else, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at this length. The final sense of fulfillment is earned but relatively untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s blend of reticence, guilt, curiosity, and emerging responsibility is well-motivated and specific (“my voice has always preferred margins,” yet they steal the crystal and descend anyway). Micro-choices—keeping the crystal, opening the vine-outlined door, softening from anger into responsibility, and ultimately testifying in defense—track a clear internal arc. The apprentices, especially Lysa, are sketched with economical but vivid individuality, with “weathered innocence” and her devotion to the vines revealing character under pressure. Ambivalence about the hush and about blame gives the protagonist credible inner conflict without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s fear-driven motive (capturing the sound of aging before her mother falls silent) is specific and consistent, and Orrin’s “precognitively forgetful” nature is dramatized rather than labeled. Their interactions—her patience, his flickering guidance—reveal values and status without exposition. The main limitation is that Mira’s internal contradiction (recording vs being present with her mother) is implied more than actively dramatized in concrete micro-choices, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is vividly particular—“trusted images more than promises,” hands knowing gears “the way others knew prayers”—with clear motives (honest timing, harnessing ephemera, unspoken grief for Lio) that drive her choices under pressure. Her competence and values directly shape tactics (rejecting jittery digital sensors for the leaf-governor), and the endurance at the end feels earned. Internal contradiction (need for constancy vs love of the fleeting, desire to capture vs to let loss escape) is present but mostly implicit rather than dramatized in an overtly conflicted choice on the page, which keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is sharply drawn—her “decisively kind” professionalism, attentiveness to sound, and refusal to promise miracles all feel specific and lived-in. Elias and Jonah’s motives are clear and consistent, and the broken-record history gives their estrangement texture. The internal contradictions are more implied than dramatized on the page; Mara, in particular, skirts the edge of idealized competence with little visible self-doubt under pressure. Still, the final handclasp and quiet death feel fully earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation (“one question that would not leave her”) is clear and consistently drives every choice, and her competence is well-grounded in concrete action (chalk circles, rune selection, how she handles the key). The “quietly deliberate” temperament is dramatized rather than told, and her refusal to force the lock nicely aligns with the story’s logic of loops. What’s thinner, at this very high bar, is emotional contradiction: she moves through discovery, danger, and the revelation about her mentor with remarkable composure, so we don’t see much layered or unstable feeling under pressure. The final realization feels earned but emotionally muted, reading more as conceptual satisfaction than a conflicted inner shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rowan is sharply drawn as a “forgiving skeptic,” and his mix of doubt, tenderness, and professional pride consistently drives his choices (tearing up the death note, re-examining the body, choosing tools over charms). His internal conflict between wanting certainty and accepting responsibility is concrete and particular rather than abstract. The relationship with Lina/changeling is sketched with just enough specificity—her “shrewdly innocent” questions, the clandestine apprenticeship—to feel lived. The final decision to step through the hedge reads earned and character-rooted, with the visible cost of abandoning safe skepticism for an uncertain rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s guilt, vow, and earthbound constraint are specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (going to the grotto, deciding to polish, choosing to share and teach) emerge cleanly from those motives. His internal conflict—fear of fire/failure vs desire to bring light—is credible, though it resolves a bit gently and cleanly for the level of trauma implied. The embodiment of memory (smell of smoke, weight of brass charts, breathing syncing with waves) gives him texture beyond a symbolic role. The final shift from punishment to purpose feels earned and forecloses a prior self-concept with legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is rich and particular—shame, paranoia, and care for the pendant all feel embodied—and the shift from hiding to risking contact with Jun is well-motivated. The line “even regret has predators” nicely crystallizes her defensive stance. Internal contradiction (needing to atone yet clinging to one “protected thing”) is present but could be stressed more acutely under Jun’s gaze. Jun’s refusal to offer easy forgiveness is credible and keeps the relationship from feeling tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s core contradiction—contracted to deliver a bright ending but drawn to a darker, truer courage—is clear and consistently enacted, especially in her resistance to the ink river’s easy current. Her motivation to “collect the shapes of different hopes” concretizes her artistic ethics well. Interiority is mostly expressed through image and choice rather than explicit thought, which suits the piece but keeps her slightly archetypal rather than fully individuated. The final choice to write the baker’s harder path feels earned and closes off the compliant option with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marn’s motivation and temperament are clear and specific—his belief in listening to wood and his whimsical tools feel grounded—but his interiority remains relatively cool, with little on-page ambivalence or cost beyond giving up the crank. The keepers function more as a collective chorus than individuated pressures, though their shame and forgetfulness are efficiently sketched. The key stance shift—that the remedy requires people, not just devices—is motivated and credible, but plays more as thematic realization than as a deeply conflicted personal choice. Overall, characterization is strong and coherent, but not yet at the level of fully fraught inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eira’s motivation—distrusting numerical language and seeking a map made of heartbeats and salvaged starlight—is clear and consistently embodied in her rituals. Her patience is dramatized through posture and pacing, not told, which gives her a distinctive inner logic without resorting to diagnostic language. Internal contradiction (dread of panic vs refusal to rely on numbers) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page moments of doubt. The cartographer is sketched as a functional foil rather than a fully-pressuring presence, keeping relationship dynamics relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivo’s motivation (to “store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is distinctive and consistent, and his professional way of thinking is well-drawn. However, we see little true internal conflict or degradation under stress—he wants something, goes about getting it competently, and largely succeeds without a felt moral or emotional crossroads. His perception is specific (peripheral focus, reading metal/surfaces), but his emotional life remains relatively abstract. The closing choice to leave with the timer feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The weaver’s motivation and flaw are clear and specific—the fear of “empty hands” is an excellent late reveal that retrofits prior behavior. Interiority is richly embodied through tactile attention to tools, ribs, hush, and weights rather than abstract feeling labels. The internal conflict between service to others and self-dissolution is dramatized via the trap and the choice to calcify the thread. The only slight limitation is that the widow’s diagnosis of the protagonist’s fear edges toward a neat therapist-style articulation rather than arising solely from the weaver’s own self-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miriam’s grief, competence, and “haunting practicality” are rendered with concrete habits (counting seconds like meat cubes, treating sorrow as inventory) that drive her choices in scene. Her internal conflict—wanting to hold onto Jory while refusing superstition—plays out through the cautious, method-driven use of the crystals. The micro-choices around what memories to embed and what lessons to carve reveal a clear value hierarchy (safety, duty, release) without neat oversimplification. The final stance—“build hands that open”—feels fully earned by the prior particulars rather than tacked-on insight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: her eroded ambition, compulsive scavenging of stories, and longing to “outrun loss” all feed directly into her present desire to negotiate with her own ghost. Her micro-choices (waiting for the hour that is both midnight and noon, choosing to offer up her hoarded images) reveal a credible hierarchy of values and a felt cost. The ghost as a three-aged reflection of herself externalizes her regret without simplifying it into a single epiphany. The only minor limitation is that we see her primarily in one mode—haunted precision—rather than in a fuller range of contradictory impulses under different pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina is sharply etched as a competent, functionally creative engineer whose quiet rule-bending (pocketing the sextant piece, ignoring the radio) feels consistent and motivating. Her interiority is mostly shown through perception and action rather than label-speak, which suits the stoic tone. However, internal contradiction (duty vs. rebellion, career risk vs. hope) remains more implied than dramatized in the moment of choice. Embodied emotion is present but relatively light, so the cost of her choices is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    The scribe’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, from “I spoke to gears more easily than to men” through the realization that “silence was not a vow, it was a wound I kept reopening.” The contradiction between a desire for silence as safety and an abandoned vocation gives his choices weight. His decision to break rules to help the bear, and to reframe silence into a new kind of “music,” feels earned from prior traits and history. The cost—accepting that his supposed holiness was self-wounding endurance—lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation and interiority are clear and particular—the tension between “serene in posture yet carrying upheaval in her chest” and her awareness that every tale she chases has been weaponized gives her a lived contradiction. Her actions (choosing salvage over profit, broadcasting the tape despite the comfort it will shatter) follow convincingly from that psychology. The internal conflict between exposing the lie and respecting the canal folk’s need for meaning is present, though it could be dramatized in one or two more pressured, moment-level micro-choices rather than mostly in reflection. Secondary characterization (the bargeman) is brief but effective as a mirror of compromised complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s vocation, methods, and values are sharply drawn, and his calm, coaxing way of acting under pressure feels consistent across beats. Secondary characters (Mara, the weaver, the clerk) are economical but distinct, each exerting specific pressure on his goal. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost in Lio—he never feels meaningfully tempted or conflicted, so his endurance is less charged than it could be. The final commitment to teaching is earned but emotionally smooth rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator and queen are sharply etched through specific behaviors (his professional method; her refusal, then near-physical clinging) and concrete, idiosyncratic details like the boy listening to soil. Motivation is coherent and textured: the queen wants an “explained absence,” the narrator seeks to understand healing through his work. Interiority is implicit but strong in the narrator’s observational choices and in the way he modulates the projection to spare her. The only slight limitation is that his own internal contradiction—professional detachment vs. emotional involvement—is more implied than pressed to an explicit on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lorian’s motivation—to reawaken beauty in a mechanized world—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices from the descent to the Archive Vats through his final decision to leave the Cradle unguarded. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembled in him like an uncalibrated spring”), and his fear/rapture in the climax feels particular. There is some internal contradiction (thrilled and frightened by disorder), but it could be sharpened into harder, more costly ambivalence at the peak. The relationship with the nun is suggestive but under-pressured; she informs and blesses rather than actively complicating his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s motivations are layered and consistent, with the tension between “arsonist’s daughter” and firefighter driving every major choice, especially disobeying orders to save the sister and later leaving the coin at the lagoon. Interiority is specific and embodied (“smelled wrong, sharp as kerosene and grief”; coin like a “pulse”), never generic. Her fear of inheriting her father’s violence vs. commitment to “unyielding compassion” is dramatized rather than asserted, and the final renunciation of the coin carries clear cost. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently but meaningfully as crucibles for her choices (the boy’s resemblance to her father; the girl as future-scarred self).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is vivid and specific: the “luminous skeptic” whose lost childhood motivates her work is a clear, coherent engine for every choice she makes. Her realism vs. wonder tension shows up in how she reads constellations as pipe maps and doubts romantic explanations. The late revelation about her mother adds a sharp, character-rooted complication, though her emotional response to that betrayal could be embodied more viscerally. Overall, her motivations and inner stance feel grounded and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s motives (refusal of fire, fear of repeating his parents’ patterns) are clear and drive every major choice, culminating in his decision to bring slow, collective light to the outskirts rather than revolutionizing the furnaces. The internal conflict between longing and distrust of destiny-as-machine is well dramatized in specific actions (trusting rotation over feeling, teaching children instead of confronting elders). Emotion is mostly conveyed through perception and action rather than labels, though occasionally it stays abstract rather than embodied in the body. The automaton’s role is focused and thematically sharp, but purely functional rather than a full relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jonas is sharply drawn through occupation-specific detail, ritual habits, and his measured response to the spectral father, with motivation (mapping collective grief) clear and consistent. His emotional life is mostly conveyed via action and concrete memory (the poem dinners, the ribbon-writing), which feels particular. What’s somewhat thin for top-tier is live internal contradiction under pressure; he almost never seriously wavers or resists, which softens the sense of cost. The siblings and the father’s spirit function more as supports to his arc than as pressure sources, but within this quiet mode, characterization lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and particular: “incremental absolution” as a self-imposed ethic, her guilt-linked hesitation, and her almost ritualistic handling of the mechanism all feel specific rather than generic remorse. Her flaw (ethical rigor that made her complicit in a corrupt system) is woven into every choice, especially in removing the lead and then exposing it to the widow without asking for forgiveness. The small, painful easing in her ribs at the tide notch is a credible, limited emotional payoff that respects the scale of loss. The widow’s brief on-page presence still reframes Mara’s actions through another’s pain, sharpening the moral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The gardener’s interiority is specific and grounded—“joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates” nails her psychology and role in one line—and her choices (agreeing to investigate, decoding, digging, planting) track cleanly from that. Alvera’s grief and need for an answer are legible without melodrama. The main lack is sharper on-page contradiction or cost for the narrator; she moves from reluctance (“I am no detective”) to competence very smoothly, without much inner friction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Jora’s motivation—to prevent another Black Winter by mapping ignorance rather than asserting certainty—is vivid and coherently developed through her choices. Her distrust of prophecy yet reliance on predictive models gives her a real internal tension that plays against the Warden’s pressure. The childhood memory of her father’s fatal maps retroactively charges her earlier restraint and caution. Secondary characterization (the Warden) is thinner but serviceable as a principled foil rather than a straw man.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives (reviving story, refusing emptiness) are clear and her actions—seeking the ember alcove, deciding to embed lyrics, insisting on a public concert—track tightly with them. Her professional specificity as a copyist gives her real texture. What’s missing, slightly, is on-page contradictory impulse or fear under peak pressure; she rarely wavers once committed, so her change feels more like steady revelation than hard-won shift. Vell’s interiority and the relationship dynamic remain thinner, operating mostly as function and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira is sharply defined through her vocation, trauma, and bone-deep distrust of “safety,” with actions (careful half-truths to inspectors, ash placement, mask use) all consistent with those traits. The backstory with her father is concrete and embodied, not abstract, and it clearly motivates her obsessive, risky practice. Internal contradiction (seeking closure for others while refusing safety illusions) is present but could be dramatized a bit more in real time rather than mostly in summary. Secondary characters are thin but adequate for their structural role.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orin’s motivation—to preserve seafaring methods against an official narrative of rational progress—is specific, consistent, and escalates plausibly from listening in the pipes to risking his body digging for the cog. His internal conflict over “trinket or principle” is credibly embodied in stomach knots and exhausted arms rather than abstract labels. The dynamic with Mara briefly but effectively stages status and ideological conflict, and his quiet refusal at the end feels like earned stasis rather than a pose. A minor limit is that his abrasiveness mostly lives in narration rather than in more varied, concrete behaviors under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is vividly rendered—her history with exclusion, her pedagogy, and her stubborn motivation all feel specific and earned, especially in the “subtracting noise” exercise. However, in the present action she is almost entirely resolved and principled; we see more of an already-achieved moral stance than live contradictory impulses under pressure. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently but remain mostly functions of the theme rather than fully pressured individuals. The final refusal to plead aligns cleanly with her established motives, but it costs her less on the page than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira feels fully realized and specific: her memory-tasting, kitchen craft, grandmother’s wisdom, and belief in “gentle rebellion” all coherently drive her choices. Her internal conflict—wanting to protect people while pruning away dangerous memories—is implicit but present in the shearing scenes. The arc from secret dew tea to serving full knowledge fruit under patrol lights reads earned and motivated. A slightly sharper on-page glimpse of her fear or doubt in the final scene could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maro’s mix of enforced honesty and private hunger for wonder is sharply drawn, and his choices (keeping the box, going to the tower, agreeing to speak) are all well-motivated. The tension between his past “lies of comfort” and his compelled truth gives him credible internal conflict. Sela is more lightly sketched but gains dimension when her defensiveness flips to confession. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that the personal cost of Maro’s final choice is more implied than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is precise, idiosyncratic, and consistently tied to how she notices and orders the world, and her core motive (understanding why some houses feel alive) cleanly drives her choices. The shard amplifies, rather than replaces, her existing sensitivity, so her actions feel character-rooted rather than magical-default. Her final renunciation of the shard is motivated and carries a quiet cost: she gives up a unique tool to let its benefits diffuse. The only limit, at this length, is that her internal contradictions (e.g., desire to keep the hush vs. share it) are present but not deeply dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilyan’s arc from righteous certainty to chastened, more complex understanding is cleanly motivated and grounded in specific mistakes (“a certainty built on partial records and righteous anger”). The Founder’s telepathic presence is distinct—calm, incisively kind, never scolding—and her choices (summoning him, guiding the revelations) feel anchored in her long watchfulness. Internal conflict is present but mostly intellectual rather than viscerally embodied; we see more cognition than bodily stress. The final choice to “welcome nuance” and return to the surface with a truer story is clearly earned and forecloses his prior simpler stance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and self-contradictory: the narrator is both “grim optimist” and ruthless skeptic about their own hope, and this tension credibly drives the climb, the gamble with the dice, and the final renunciation. Motivation—to re-touch the “texture” of a lost chance—remains clear and sharp throughout. The final choice to stop imagining a better landing feels earned by prior reasoning and memory, with a visible emotional cost. The only small limitation is the absence of a second on-page character to pressure the protagonist in real time, keeping the crucible purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s drive for proof and survival is specific and consistent, and Ro’s internalized cynicism about kindness provides effective counterpressure. Their shared memory of the blackout and the grandmother’s song is an earned, character-rooted hinge, not a contrivance. The internal stakes—whether Mira can trust that kindness persists—shift credibly into her final ability to sleep. A slightly sharper sense of Mira’s fear of being wrong in the moment with Ro (some contradiction between hope and defensive skepticism) could deepen the internal conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maris’s motives—protecting art and people through curation and bread—are vivid, coherent, and drive every major choice, with nice textural contradictions (her “historically oriented mind” using dates as a talisman against collapse). Her dread and tenderness are embodied in specific habits (the velvet pouch, late-night baking, the way rosewater both soothes and unsettles her). Internal conflict is present but could cut a little deeper at peak pressure; she rarely seems truly torn between preserving the collection and shielding the refugees. Secondary characters are sketched effectively as a collective pressure rather than individuals, and the captain gets a quick but credible pivot through the proffered loaf.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orin’s motivation is sharp and specific—rewriting the day his sister drowned—and his counter-clockwise, grief-driven ingenuity plays cleanly into every choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (the stone “measured his shadows”), and his final renunciation feels earned by prior obsession. The internal conflict between forcing fate and accepting cost is clear on the page at the peak. I might like one more moment of irrational temptation or near-failure at the brink, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and strangely embodied (“my lungs still tasted of pennywater and dust”), with a clear, consistent drive to outwit the curse. The contradiction between terror and compulsion (returning to the funhouse so soon after resuscitation) feels earned and character-particular. Micro-choices—tightening the clasp, entering the last booth, letting it bite skin—track cleanly with that motivation. The closing shift, where the advisor reveals itself as her own breath, lands as an earned reconfiguration of self rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leeward’s core motive—turning danger into sound—remains consistent and drives every major choice, and his refusal to sermonize at the end underlines a believable, modest self-concept. We don’t get deep interior monologue, but his worldview is expressed concretely through actions (climbing the tree, shouting the spar’s arc, repairing the mallet). Internal contradiction is relatively subtle (pragmatic leader vs. mystic listener), so the emotional cost of his stance is more implied than viscerally felt. Still, his motivations clearly intensify under pressure and culminate in an earned, character-specific endurance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation—answering the question of the watchers and the lost expedition—is clear, consistent, and elegantly embedded in her craft and habits. Her agency drives every turn (following fractures, opening the seam, decoding the journal, composing an answer, stepping through the gate). What’s missing at a top-tier level is more on-page contradiction or emotional friction (fear vs. drive, attachment to Kel Varo vs. urge to leave) under pressure. The final choice feels earned but emotionally underdeveloped compared to the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and conflicted—she feels the comfort of the lie yet chooses against it—and her “emotionally rational” habit is dramatized in how she questions rather than accuses. Hadrin is more lightly sketched but convincing as a man trapped by his own curation, with the confession about incremental edits landing well. The final bargain and her promise to name his partial virtue feel earned by what we’ve seen of both. A slight tendency to state traits (“emotionally rational”) rather than let them fully emerge in action keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is vivid and specific—“interlaced absence” and the mother’s inkwell give her a distinctive psychology, and her clandestine foundation-notes concretize that longing in action. Her exterior stoicism vs. interior sensitivity is shown rather than told, particularly in the confrontation with Beran where she acts decisively while holding emotional drive tight. Internal contradiction (duty-bound surveyor vs. rogue archeologist of memory) is present but could sharpen under peak pressure. Beran is thinly sketched yet functions adequately as a focused, status-bearing antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s motive—quietly exposing the forged maps—is clear, character-specific, and governs every investigative move. Her “tranquilly perceptive” mindset is well dramatized in how she chooses to work alone and methodically decodes the catalog. The inner conflict is more implied than dramatized: fear and resolve are mentioned but rarely clash in a way that forces visible error or hesitation. The final choice to carry only images and leave the stamp feels earned and reveals a credible value hierarchy with real personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation is crystalline from the outset—grief for Jalen—and every major choice (learning gem polishing, accepting the Archive Spire’s price, stepping into the projection) coheres with that drive. Her interiority is particular (“her hands cannot remember the weight of his laughter”) rather than generic sadness. The internal conflict between preserving herself and giving something up for Jalen is implied more than dramatized in scene; we don’t linger inside her hesitation at key thresholds. A touch more embodied ambivalence under peak pressure would move this toward true mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation is precise and convincing: his survivor status and “refusal to look away” organically drive both his work and his moral calculus. Interiority is rich and character-specific, especially the blend of scientific thinking and grief (e.g., “graduate ruins,” “drone strike wedding survivor”). Contradictory impulses—vengeance vs. mercy, obsession vs. the inability to undo the past—are present but could be dramatized in slightly sharper on-page friction rather than mostly conceptualized. The final choice to encode mercy into the drones feels earned and costly, but the cost remains largely internal rather than behaviorally conflicted in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara and the pilgrim are sharply etched in a small space—her “perpetually surprised” competence and itch for missing pieces, his tired, almost mystical quest. Motivation is consistently clear and behavior aligns with it, especially in how Mara uses her skills and curiosity to pursue the observatory’s secret. Internal contradiction exists but is relatively gentle rather than truly pressured, and the emotional cost of their discovery is more suggested than dramatized. The ending’s sense of “family” feels earned but lands a touch neatly, without much friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt, professional self-betrayal, and fear of blame are rendered with specific, embodied detail, and her final choice to confess feels fully earned by prior causality. The internal contradiction—her skill at erasing lineages vs. her need to restore one—is sharp and active in the scene. Jonah is thinner by comparison, functioning more as a pressure source than a fully realized counterpart, though his dream-ticking detail is strong. The closing walk to the shore as shared quiet rather than sieved hush lands as a credible relational shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority—“living in that gap, between apology and forgiveness”—is vivid and particular, and her choices (levering the wire, insisting the handle be sent home) clearly flow from that. The commanders are efficiently but distinctly drawn through small gestures (Sarin not kicking the handle, Vek watching the moon as if it might judge him). Internal contradiction is quieter than it might be at elite level—Lena rarely feels genuinely torn on the page, more serenely principled. Still, her hierarchy of values under pressure is legible and paid off in the final handoff to the boy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theo’s shame, avoidance, and residual competence are rendered with specific, embodied detail, and his micro-choices (accepting the thermos, choosing inland, stopping at pole seventy-two) all track cleanly with his need to atone. The collision backstory and his relationship to the lost crewman feel vivid and psychologically plausible. Internal contradiction—wanting to navigate but mistrusting himself, wanting absolution but fearing exposure—is present throughout. A few lines (“align heart and action,” “stop flinching at his own name”) verge on abstract shorthand rather than fully dramatized feeling, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s conflicting impulses—habitual coldness versus emerging empathy—are concretely dramatized in choices like hauling up the thief and refusing the wallet. Motivation evolves credibly from self-erasure to an active desire “to kindle empathy where none remains.” Emotional texture is specific (“Wonder survived in me like a bruise you keep pressing”) rather than labeled. The final renunciation of safety to testify feels earned by prior micro-choices and carries believable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s grief-driven steadiness, her beast-whisperer vocation, and her reluctance to change form all cohere into a clear hierarchy of values, and her final choice to relinquish her human body feels earned and costly. The internal conflict between clinging to self and refusing more silence is present on the page, though it could sharpen with one more moment of hesitation or self-contradiction before she consents. Sable is mostly a presence and symbol rather than a fully individuated character, but that suits this length and mode. The closing realization about her gift being about listening, not command, grows credibly from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivations—exhaustion, guilt over “thrown away” seconds, fierce attachment to her daughter—are specific and consistent, and they culminate in the choice to accept the slow, painful return of time. Contradictory impulses (begging the universe to “take it” vs. later insisting on re-living every second) are dramatized rather than explained away. The final endurance choice at the tree feels earned by the prior depiction of sleep-deprived bargaining and occult habit. Relationship with the daughter, though mostly one-sided on the page, nonetheless functions as a clear crucible that constrains every decision.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and specific: archivist, pacifist, guilt-ridden yet stubbornly hopeful, with clear motivation tied to the last child and the rumored dimension. Her pacifism, regret over the mutiny, and fear that only self-forgivers can pass create a credible inner tangle that’s worked through in concrete choices (sorting photos, sewing, confessing to Lio, naming her flaws at the hatch). The embodied quirk of becoming lighter when happy is not just flavor but interacts with her emotional regulation. A slight cap comes from Lio being more symbolic than fully pressured as a character, though his question does sharpen her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amina is vivid, specific, and motivated: the “destitute philanthropist” who trusts coincidences and seeks the “texture of transformation” is a strong, coherent core, and her choice to follow the hush into the cave and release the lightning bugs feels earned. Her internal life is present but slightly too serene; we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull between fear/self-preservation and her compulsion to give or to know. Toma functions well as a foil whose suspicion turns to wonder, but his own conflict is fairly light. The final shift—her recognizing change as “hot, granular, and shared” and immediately acting from it—lands, though the cost of that stance could be shaded more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is sharply drawn as a “calmly inventive” technician of locks and angles, and their motives for a silent, infrastructural revolution are clear and consistent. Micro-choices (scratching codes into the sundial, using the quill holder as misdirection with Orven, picking the lock in-sleeve) reveal competence and values under pressure. What’s missing at an elite level is a stronger sense of contradictory impulses or felt fear—there’s little visible emotional cost to their subversion, so interior conflict stays relatively cool. The relationship with Orven is functional for tension but not deeply character-revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Eren’s guilt, promise to Lysa, and precognitive curse all pull against each other in scene, giving his choices real tension, especially when he almost flees from Marel but doesn’t. His inner life is particularized through his methods (counting eel turns “as if they were numbers in prayer”) rather than abstract feeling labels. The final decision—to stay and teach instead of running from guilt—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. Marel is sketched efficiently yet carries real pressure on Eren without collapsing into type.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil” is a sharp, character-particular contradiction, not a stock insight. Motivation (to make meaning from censorship and familial betrayal) clearly drives each choice, from agreeing to the ritual to reframing how they’ll resist. The father’s posthumous confession is morally thorny and not tidily resolved, which keeps the emotional arc honest. Lysa is slightly more symbolic than individuated, but she still exerts clear, focused pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysander’s motives (curiosity, civic responsibility, “turn questions into destinations”) are clear and consistently dramatized through his choices—from probing the sundial to forcing a duel framed as negotiation. The “diplomatically fierce” contradiction is nicely embodied, though we get more stance than deep emotional contradiction under peak pressure. Veller is effectively sketched as a status-conscious opportunist, but remains thematically functional rather than layered. The final mercy—asking Veller to walk the first leg—feels earned by earlier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Len feels vivid and particular—the penny haiku, the ash in his pockets, the monthly molting of personalities—and his choices (breaking into the library, instituting “payment” in acts, nearly burning the pamphlets) track cleanly to his stated motives and fears. The personality shifts give him credible contradiction, especially when June’s gentleness almost undoes the earlier radical work until Mara’s letter steadies him. Mara, though mostly off-page, has clear desire and agency via her dreamed library and her tactical suggestion about what else can fit in the tin. The relationship arc is strong but necessarily compressed; we don’t quite see their dynamic under direct pressure beyond that first Rilke moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lio’s grief, stubborn hope, and strategic creativity are woven through concrete objects (clock, piano, film) so his internal state reads as specific rather than generic. His central contradiction—clinging to broken time while seeking an “unplanned encore”—runs cleanly into the choice to accept goodbye rather than hide in the looping refuge. Micro-choices (taking the reel despite the warning, climbing into the trunk, choosing to play the avoided chord) are all character-driven, not plot-forced. The final shift from holding to releasing goodbyes feels earned with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tavo’s role, worldview, and conflicted motives (skeptical empiricist vs. yearning for proof/belonging) are sharply drawn and consistently drive his choices, especially in how he tests the seed despite the obvious magic. His “luminous doubt” is dramatized in concrete methods (weighing shadows, cracked stopwatch) rather than summary labels. The internal conflict—mistrust of dream-instructions vs. measured evidence of shared dreaming—is credible and present in scene. The only slight limitation is a relative lack of embodied, physical emotional detail under peak pressure compared to the richness of conceptual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation (processing the father’s abandonment) is clear and consistently expressed through concrete objects and actions, and the final realization that “the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence” feels earned. Interiority is vivid and particular, not generic, with good embodiment via sensory detail and the bonsai act. Internal conflict—blame vs. buried complicity—could surface more explicitly in on-page micro-choices before the ship to sharpen the eventual shift. Still, the pruning decision at the end forecloses a prior, more self-righteous stance with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s internal pivot from rigid "preprocessing" to "kindled humility" is convincing and rooted in her scientific background. The shift is earned through the specific labor of the dust mapping, though Lupe functions more as a catalyst than a fully realized counterweight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist displays high agency and competence, but the emotional arc feels asserted through thematic labels ("purpose in the pauses") rather than embodied struggle. The shift from artist to forensic tracker to glass engineer is convenient, lacking the friction or error that characterizes deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orren is a consistent, functional protagonist whose background as a survivor neatly equips him to solve the plot's problem. However, his internal journey lacks friction; he transitions from survivor to savior without significant doubt or struggle on the page. The realization regarding the "empty slot" feels intellectually assigned rather than emotionally earned through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marek is a distinct, weary focalizer whose professional history ("undertaker for a coast that has no coast") deeply informs his perception. The "inadvertently stubborn" trait is not just a label but the engine of the plot, driving him past the point of safety (bleeding ears) to achieve a resonant, character-specific goal.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amira is a compelling focalizer whose "gently persistent" nature is expertly dramatized through her use of the bell and her nuanced confrontation with the officer. Her internal landscape—seeing fear turn into care—is grounded in specific, embodied actions rather than abstract summary. The choice to pair youth with elders demonstrates character agency that directly shapes the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara is somewhat passive; her internal crisis is resolved primarily through the instructions of a magical guide rather than her own agency or struggle. While her interiority is lyrical ("chest like an unopened letter"), the emotional progression feels smoothed over by the intervention, lacking the friction of a difficult, earned choice. The "past life" aspect feels more like an inserted backstory constraint than a driver of character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is poetic but drives concrete, specialized choices like the hyperbolic design, elevating the character beyond a mere functionary. The internal pivot from seeking to capture time to letting it "rust into light" constitutes a strong, earned arc grounded in the story's unique metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara is an archetype ("chained liberator") rather than a conflicted individual; her motivation is stated via label ("simple enough to carry") rather than dramatized through difficult emotional trade-offs. The interaction with the boy feels staged to deliver a thematic lesson rather than a genuine human moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara is a distinct, sharply drawn protagonist whose synesthesia and profession directly fuel the narrative logic. Her choice to record the betrayal and immediately transmute the artifact into new work avoids generic revenge tropes, showcasing a specific "designer's" resilience. The internal conflict between grief and the technical pursuit of "the sound of trust breaking" is resolved with a high-cost realization on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio is a compelling protagonist with a distinct, vocation-driven worldview that informs every observation. The internal pivot from acquisitive voyeurism to "strange mercy" is grounded in the scene's emotional logic, though the "you" character's sudden insight into Lio's nature ("portraits were not his trophies but his invitations") feels slightly like the author speaking through a puppet to clarify the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara is a vividly realized protagonist whose contradiction—grief masked by theatricality—drives the narrative. Her profession as a glassblower is not merely aesthetic but instrumental to the resolution, and her internal struggle with the "verdict" of silence is deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, blending specific phobias with an adaptive nature that drives the plot. However, her sudden shift from terrified compliance to "vulnerability is power" feels more like a thematic assertion than a dramatized psychological progression, and the "adaptive" trait functions largely as a license for convenient puzzle-solving skills.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal drive is strong, shifting credibly from a hunger for control (visual mapping) to acceptance of the void. Lyr serves as an effective mentor/antagonist who forces this internal change. The specific phrasing "mildly obsessed" slightly undercuts the physical intensity of "hands shook," creating a minor dissonance in the character's stated versus embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    J-17 is a masterclass in specific non-human interiority; details like aligning "broom bristles by touch" and the "salt cart" grounding create a distinct consciousness that avoids cliché. The "longing" is dramatized through tactile interaction with the ice violin, making the emotional arc feel physically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a compelling focalizer whose transition from fearful observer to active participant is well-motivated by the specific pressures of the silent environment. Her internal conflict between self-preservation and the desire for honesty drives the narrative effectively, though her realization that "secrecy manufactures suspicion" reads slightly more as a thematic assertion than an embodied emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a fully realized creation, his "wisely pragmatic" nature dramatized through specific habits like saving string and polishing marbles. The internal contradiction—a man of integrity who used "mended deception" to save the garden—powers the narrative drive effectively. His motivation to prove a truth to the roots rather than the bureaucrat allows for a climax that feels deeply personal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose shift from "obliging" observer to active problem-solver is earned through the immediate threat to the station. Her internal motivation—preferring a "clean cause" over "grand theory"—sharply defines her agency during the climax. The interaction between her practical nature and Sen's ambition creates a solid character dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena is a distinct, competent focalizer whose reverence for the music grounds the surrealism. While her motivation is clear and she moves the plot efficiently, she lacks significant internal conflict or a distinct flaw that complicates her choices; she functions more as a faithful disciple solving a puzzle than a character forced into a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara is an exceptional secondary character; her "oracle" nature is dramatized through the specific action of smudging the notebook rather than just label-speak. The narrator's internal state—guilt as physical weight—is vivid, and the shift from hiding to confessing is earned by the interaction in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, balancing "reckless" exploration with "religious skepticism" in a way that feels embodied rather than labeled. The final choice—sealing the tunnel but forcing the confrontation—is a strong, earned stance that arises from the character's internal conflict and the events of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from hoarding to composting knowledge is a well-earned internal arc. However, the "other keeper" functions more as a thematic signboard than a distinct character, reducing the potential for genuine friction in the dialogue. The trait of "gripping reality loosely" works well to enable the magic but feels slightly convenient rather than a flaw that generates obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora is drawn with empathy, and her motivation to help Mara is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on prompt-label traits ("cautious exuberance") rather than embodied complexity. The emotional breakthrough is touching but feels slightly mechanical, lacking the internal resistance or contradiction that marks a deep character arc. The "cost" of opening the locket is present but low-stakes, reading more as a plot device than a searing personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lysa is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose specific tools (eartrumpets) and actions ground her characterization. The primary weakness is the expository handling of her key trait ("because she was sensitively perceptive"), which relies on a direct label rather than purely dramatized behavior. Her final choice to abandon the diaries' plea and mark the new north demonstrates agency and defines her role.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lian is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—predicting others' fate versus composing her own—drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct in the climax when she reinterprets her own prophecy to save the courier. The relationship with Mara adds a layer of professional respect that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selo is a distinct, compelling focalizer whose professional toolkit (the loop pedal, rhetoric) deeply informs his worldview and actions. The "priest as rhetorical engineer" concept provides a strong internal logic for his choices. Mara functions primarily as a site of conflict rather than a fully realized agent until the final beat, though her memory of the brother serves as a functional pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—defined as "chronological homesickness"—is distinct and compelling, driving the ritualistic behavior that anchors the story. The shift from "clawing at the past" to "seeding futures" is a legible internal arc, though the emotional cost is somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally painful.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's specific ability ("gravity defier") acts as a perfect metaphor for her internal flaw (avoidance of commitment), creating a cohesive character arc. The choice to kneel and accept "weight" provides a strong, physically dramatized Decisive Change. However, the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic interiority ("labyrinth was built from the times she had floated away") rather than trusting the subtext, which slightly flattens the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara is a capable, proactive protagonist whose deafness is integrated meaningfully into her competence, allowing her to sense vibrations others miss. However, her internal landscape is relatively static; the "emotional numbness" functions more as a plot device than a source of deep psychological friction or contradictory impulse. She solves the external problem with professional skill, but the personal cost is minimal, lacking a moment of difficult choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's specific trade ("storm recorder") beautifully informs their interiority ("panic only blurs detail") and tactical choices. The drive to "nurture integrity" is tested by the sister's peril, forcing a specific, high-cost action that aligns with established traits. The shift from solitary observer to active participant is earned, though the sister's characterization is functional rather than deep.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio’s internal conflict is grounded in specific behavioral traits like being "aromatically cautious," which effectively dramatizes his trauma. While the emotional arc is strong, the final shift to stewardship feels slightly summary-heavy and relies on the discovered ledger to resolve his guilt rather than a purely internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Agency is high; the protagonist actively drives the plot through the specific fabrication of the slipknot lock rather than observing passively. The "mother taught" reference provides a brief but sufficient anchor for the ethical stance, and the motivation to "discover the texture of time" is grounded effectively in the physical manipulation of the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s acoustic sensitivity is well-established, but it functions more as a magical tool than a source of deep character friction; the "burden" mentioned is solved too easily by the climax. Her shift from grief to "laughing without shame" is legible, though the internal cost of that transition feels rushed given the low resistance she faces.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s transition from detachment to intimacy is earned through the tactile inspection of Orin’s trauma. The internal conflict is resolved by a high-stakes micro-choice—sacrificing her own privacy ("my own shame")—which carries visible cost. The emotional logic holds up under the lens of professional survival turning into genuine connection.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a distinct focalizer, and her background as a cargo broker is cleverly integrated into her problem-solving (reading discrepancies, funding the envelopes). However, the transition from "shrewd broker" to gentle philanthropist relies heavily on the summarized backstory of her mother rather than a pressure-tested choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sava’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the opening ache to the final integration. While her desire for belonging is poignant, the internal friction is mild; the interaction with Oren and Ilya is cooperative rather than testing her resolve. The transition from outsider to accepted member feels earned through competence, though the emotional cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    Rin’s motivation is professionally grounded and philosophically resonant, driving her to a high-stakes choice that incurs visible cost. The internal conflict—seeking a resolution that requires breaking a pattern—is dramatized beautifully in the climax. The acceptance of the "debt" at the end earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is distinct and consistent; Lysa's specific worldview ("mathematics of emotion") effectively drives her methodology and choices. The tension between her urge to run to her brother and her "conjurer" need for proof creates a strong, character-specific internal conflict that pays off in the bridge-building resolution. The emotional logic, while intellectualized, fits the established voice perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lio is a distinct, sensory-driven presence, but his desire for visibility lacks a dramatic test; he achieves his goal ("feeling seen") without ever risking his safety or sacrificing his secrecy. The lack of a high-stakes choice under pressure leaves his internal conflict largely theoretical rather than dramatized in a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s internal contradiction—desiring intimacy with plants "in theory but not in skin"—establishes a compelling psychological hook that drives the narrative. Her transition from resistance to acceptance is legible, though the pivotal emotional shift occurs largely in summary ("resisted it by making lists") rather than in a dramatized moment of pressure. The interaction with the boy effectively grounds her "circuitously sincere" trait in specific behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding the sister's memory drives the narrative effectively. However, the protagonist's traits rely on told labels ("wryly earnest habit") rather than being fully dramatized through distinct micro-choices early on. The final choice to trade the brooch is a strong character moment that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Character motivations are stated clearly, but the internal pivot—Lan realizing his motive "had always been Sera's"—feels summarized rather than dramatized through pressure. The emotional shift from terror to harmonious singing lacks a sufficient on-page bridge of struggle or resistance, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara functions effectively as a catalyst for the town's healing but lacks personal risk or internal contradiction. She operates from a position of secure competence, resolving the boy's challenge and Sorrel's grief with ready wisdom rather than struggling through genuine doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s compulsion is well-drawn and drives the action, but the climax relies on a diagnostic confession ("silence felt safer than change") rather than subtext. This explicitly articulated self-analysis reduces the emotional impact of the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s arc from skepticism to holding "certainty of meaning" is earned through specific sensory interactions with the tile rather than abstract epiphany. Her "courageously kind" trait manifests in costly action (sharing the writing burden) and physical endurance, grounding the magical elements in character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ilias’s ennui and specific curiosity are drawn with sharp economy, creating a distinct internal landscape. The realization that boredom is cowardice acts as a potent pivot, earning the final transformation. The internal state drives the physical action seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara is an expertly drawn protagonist whose "ledger" worldview creates a unique internal logic that drives the narrative. Her decision to defy Ivo is deeply rooted in her characterization as the "honest child" seeking mathematical fairness, making the climax feel inevitable yet earned. The relationship dynamic serves as a perfect crucible, forcing a shift in power that is legible and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Haru is a compelling, specific focalizer whose motivation to "collect textures" drives the narrative. His interiority is lush and consistent, though the emotional cost of his "incandescent restraint" feels slightly muted compared to the intellectual rigor of his method.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's specific sensory condition ("turns sound into touch") is not merely ornamental but drives their interaction with the world and the central conflict. The shift from passive collection to active preservation ("whispered the rescued names") is a distinct micro-choice that earns the final state of being a "vessel." The emotional cost is palpable in the "grain" of weight added to their erased history.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eli has a distinct worldview ("gloomy cheerfulness," "superstition as crooked map"), but his role as a "myth buster" contradicts his uncritical acceptance of the magical ritual. The internal conflict regarding his mother and professor is resolved too neatly through the magical mechanism, lacking the grit of a genuine psychological struggle. The "damp cheeks" suggest emotion, but the internal cost feels asserted rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation and traits are established through explicit authorial labels ("orderly intuitive," "loyalties split like the tide") rather than dramatized friction or subtext. Internal conflict is summarized as a static state ("owed the Council... owed the performers") instead of being rendered through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a specific scene. The protagonist's emotions are named ("hope," "panic," "desperation") rather than embodied in action or physical response.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s dual motivation (official report vs. personal preservation) drives the scene effectively, creating a layered interiority. The dynamic with Eli is understated yet poignant, revealing character through shared values rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lio is a vivid, competent protagonist with a distinct sensory worldview, but he lacks internal conflict or a dilemma that forces a difficult choice. His success relies on established mastery rather than character evolution or sacrifice, resulting in a static arc despite the high agency.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, blending professional expertise with a cynical, lyrical worldview ("truth is a quarrel of waters"). Interiority is specific and grounded in his trade ("said it like an editor"), and the motivation to correct the map drives all action. The final choice to document the truth despite the Ministry's threat is a well-earned stance that defines his character.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sava functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction, doubt, or distinct interiority. While appropriate for a fable, the lack of an emotional hierarchy or difficult choice limits engagement; he is a vehicle for the concept rather than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is compelling, and her choice to engage with the temple’s logic rather than flee defines her agency under pressure. The internal conflict is clear, though the pivotal moment where she "overrode instinct" is summarized with a diagnostic label rather than fully dramatized through embodied reaction, slightly distancing the reader at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—chasing "hush" to counter his father's legacy of noise and lies—is compelling and successfully drives the narrative. The voice is distinct, blending a mythical burden with gritty prison reality. The transition to the magical element of "hovering" feels slightly abrupt in terms of physical grounding, but the emotional logic holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation and interiority are exceptional; the protagonist’s guilt is visceral, and the bride’s "lovingly venomous" duality creates a complex, charged dynamic. The relationship serves as a perfect crucible, forcing a choice that feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ila’s motivation is clearly defined and poetic, driving the narrative’s unique problem-solving. However, her characterization relies on narrator summary and trait-labeling ("hauntingly optimistic") rather than embodied reactions and micro-choices within a sustained high-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.6)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("hoped that digging... might lead her back") rather than dramatized through pressure. The pivotal realization occurs in summary ("admitted to herself"), which distances the reader from the emotional cost and reduces the complexity of her internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is a distinct professional with a clear, unique motivation ("discover meaning in the margins") that drives agency. The shift from observer to active participant is earned through competence, though the courier functions primarily as a catalyst for tension rather than a fully deepened character.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora is a distinct protagonist whose specific skill (embroidery as coding) drives the plot and defines her worldview. Her "foolishness" disguise is not merely a label but a tactical choice deployed effectively to resolve the climax. The internal consistency of her actions and motivations is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional specificity; her shift from performing a rehearsed apology to inhabiting the raw "moment before" is earned through concrete on-page struggle (tearing the letter, holding the shard). The choice to stay three nights demonstrates agency and endurance that charges the final reconciliation with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lani is a distinct professional with clear agency, and her internal "dictionary" of anxiety provides strong grounding. However, the secondary characters (Captain, Liaison) function as convenient plot devices who yield their deep-seated grievances too easily, reducing the sense of genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s internal deficit (loss of joy) is clear, and she takes steps to resolve it, but the middle beats rely heavily on external instruction (the moths) rather than her own ingenuity or difficult choices. The emotional arc feels automatic—a procedural cure rather than a struggle with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s internal conflict between certainty and curiosity is dramatized rather than merely stated, driving the nested narrative structure. The final renunciation ("I do not know yet") earns the character arc by paying the cost of professional authority for a deeper, vulnerable truth. The "methodically playful" trait is actively demonstrated through her interaction with the sound garden.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation shifts credibly from passive sheltering to active defiance, culminating in the choice to distract the auditors. Lio functions well as a catalyst, though his &quot;charming rogue&quot; persona verges on archetypal. The internal struggle is somewhat muted by the rapid timeline, but the final stance feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara's internal struggle culminates in a decisive on-page choice to sacrifice her most treasured possession, creating a visible cost that earns the resolution. Her motivation is grounded in specific history, moving beyond the "shy poet" label to active agency.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is effectively drawn as a dedicated caretaker, with the "foxglove regret" providing a distinct emotional anchor. While the internal friction in the Hall of Apologies ("old words tried to return") offers a glimpse of personal stakes, the character remains largely defined by their function rather than deep psychological contradictions. The "steadied myself" moment resolves the internal conflict quickly, prioritizing role over personal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding silence is well-established. However, the climax summarizes her confession ("Mara confessed everything") rather than dramatizing the dialogue, distancing the reader from the character's most vulnerable moment. The trait "carefully reckless" relies on label-speak rather than being demonstrated through a choice with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is a highly competent protagonist whose internal state (trembling with hope, not fear) provides a fresh, specific emotional anchor. The relationship with Rolen is efficiently sketched through action and silence, creating a believable "sly" alliance. The "ingenious machinist" trait is substantiated by her use of tools to solve a social problem.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s internal conflict—survival via erasure versus the preservation of dangerous truth—is dramatized with exceptional clarity. The "withering" realization at the climax, where she understands her safety has cost her vitality, creates a profound, earned psychological pivot that justifies the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is distinct and her motivation to understand her father is clear, but her interiority often feels filtered through abstract thematic summary rather than embodied emotion. The repetition of the awkward prompt phrase "featherly determined" creates a jarring, artificial note in her characterization. While her choice to jump is motivated, the "ethical" nature of the risk feels intellectualized rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is distinct and evocative; Mira’s professional mysticism contrasts well with Jonah’s grounded resignation. Their connection feels earned through the shared action of the firefly release rather than forced dialogue. The "landscape astrologer" identity is fully embodied in Mira's worldview and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist is a consistent observer but lacks internal conflict or personal stakes beyond professional curiosity; the emotional risk is entirely outsourced to the secondary character, Mira. Mira’s pivotal change—moving from denial to apology—happens too easily, with her resistance dissolving instantly upon instruction rather than through dramatized struggle. The "cheerful gloom" trait is stated but reads more as a whimsical quirk than a pressure-tested worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Milo is a distinctly drawn protagonist whose "analytical" nature drives every beat, from the chess roll to the calculated rescue. His motivation to "serenade monotony" is woven into his actions, though the "numbers man" label in dialogue feels slightly on-the-nose. The internal consistency is high, with his skills directly enabling the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira's agency drives the narrative; she actively chooses the harder path (keeping the grief-binding shard) over easy release. The internal conflict between panic and dancer's discipline is embodied in the scene through the "seated dance," grounding the character's skills in the immediate crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ilya is a consistent, archetypal figure, but he lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. He functions as a vehicle for wisdom rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s internal landscape is distinct, but Jonah functions as a device who is "cured" of deep trauma instantly by an anecdote ("hands that no longer shook"). The psychological progression for the secondary character lacks realism, resolving complex guilt with a single conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mina is a sharply drawn focalizer; her "logical dreamer" persona informs every metaphor and action, creating a consistent internal logic. The realization of her "ensemble" nature serves as a strong internal turning point, grounding the magical realism in character growth. The emotional cost—the surrender of solitary ego for collective efficacy—is subtle but palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s agency is clear, culminating in a decisive professional transgression to protect the archive. However, her internal state at the climax is summarized ("legacy's burden settled on her chest") rather than dramatized through visceral reaction, which intellectualizes the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (panic vs. the borrowed calm) is compelling, and the motivation to save the sister drives the narrative effectively. However, the mechanism of the "borrowed heartbeat" is slightly ambiguous regarding its physical necessity versus its emotional utility, which softens the stakes of renouncing it.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sera’s specific backstory (the corridor massacre) effectively grounds the "forever war" archetype, transforming the "operatively gentle" trait from a label into a tactical behavior. Her internal conflict—balancing guilt with the discipline required to force peace—drives the ritual's climax without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Inez is a compellingly contradictory figure; her "amoral philanthropist" persona is dramatized through the massive, tangible cost of the drought she engineered. The internal conflict is vivid, though the direct labeling of her as "secretly sentimental" slightly undercuts the otherwise strong showing of that trait through action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is a distinct, highly competent protagonist with a clear voice and backstory that anchors the stakes. However, her execution of the plan is nearly flawless; she lacks a dramatized internal flaw or a moment of genuine vulnerability that complicates her success, resulting in a lack of visible on-page cost for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    Ilya creates a complete arc from arrogance to collaboration, but his internal landscape is largely summarized rather than dramatized. The transition from his initial "uncommon serenity" to the "earned" softness relies on stated realizations ("he saw half-lit epiphanies") rather than pressure-filled choices in the moment. The "urbane calligrapher" persona feels disconnected from the "seedy bar puppeteer" reality, existing more as a quirky label than a coherent identity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Arin’s motivation is distinctly drawn ("esoteric realist") and deeply felt, grounding the narrative in a specific worldview. The "weight of keeping so many unseen lives in mind" provides a tangible emotional anchor that elevates his role beyond a mere observer. His agency is consistent, driving the plot through expertise and dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's specific expertise as a lost wax caster anchors the narrative beautifully, grounding magical elements in tactile labor. However, the decision to frame the story "after forgiving yourself" places the primary emotional struggle in the backstory; the on-page arc is competence-driven rather than a conflict of values or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is distinct ("worthy of being chosen"), but the "precisely playful" trait is asserted rather than dramatized in interaction. The character's defining perceptual limitation (no present) contradicts the immediate, grounded sensory narration of the scene, creating a disconnect between concept and execution.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nabu-iddin is a masterclass in concise characterization; his "frugal grief" and "empirically ironic" worldview are not just labels but engines for decision-making. The climax—sacrificing his tool of certainty—is a profound, character-specific choice that earns the shift in his internal state. The interiority is distinct, blending scientific discipline with a suppressed longing for the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio is a compelling protagonist whose "scheming pacifist" identity drives the plot and informs his unique methodology. His motivation to redirect conflict is clear and tested by Mara's resistance, though the "cellular memory" introspection leans slightly into diagnostic explanation rather than embodied feeling. Mara serves effectively as a formidable obstacle whose turn is earned through the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio is a distinctly drawn archetype whose core trait ("firmly grounded") provides essential friction against his ephemeral goal. The shift from imposing order ("straight edges") to accepting a fluid reality ("erasing boundaries") is a clear, character-specific arc executed well within the short form. The internal cost is visible in the physical and mental exertion of the ritual, though the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is a distinct presence with a specific skill set, and the interaction with the boy reveals her values under pressure. However, traits like "feisty" are explicitly labeled ("Her feisty grumble was endearing even to herself") rather than dramatized, and the interiority occasionally slips into explanatory exposition about her motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s trajectory from bewildered curator to the architect of her own ancestry is anchored in strong, specific interiority. The emotional shift from curiosity to the acceptance of the "trap" is earned, with the grandmother’s laughter providing a visceral link to the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lysa functions as a hyper-competent archetype who solves obstacles instantly with specific skills, lacking internal contradiction, doubt, or emotional cost. Orren serves primarily as an exposition device; neither character exhibits a struggle that forces a difficult choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her defining trait ("chimera twin") functions more as backstory justification than a driver of difficult choices in the scene. Her internal state is described through metaphor ("unkindled solace") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visceral reactions to the ship's threats.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara functions as a competent solver rather than a character under pressure. Her trait ("warmly methodical") is applied as a label rather than emerging from struggle, and her emotional arc—from anger to steady purpose—feels declared rather than embodied. She faces no internal contradictions or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sava is a highly competent protagonist whose specific perceptual skillset drives the narrative. Her motivation is clearly articulated and internalized, leading directly to the resolution. However, her journey is one of linear expertise rather than deep internal conflict or the overcoming of a significant character flaw, which limits the emotional dimensionality of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is functional and their motivation is clear, but it is stated explicitly ("That was my obsession") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The "retrocognitive" ability serves primarily as an expository device to deliver backstory and codes, feeling like a convenience rather than a deeply integrated trait that creates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, and the motivation to save the Archive is firmly rooted in their "summer-quill" persona. The internal arc—moving from observing lives to offering up one's own—is compelling, though the "risk" of the final choice feels more intellectual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Jorin is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear motivation ("defy gravity of hopelessness") that drives the narrative. However, he functions primarily as a catalyst with minimal internal conflict or personal cost; his success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle against his own limits.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara is a deeply realized protagonist; her secret defiance (hiding jarred copies) contrasts beautifully with her outward role as a soothing mediator for Iven. This internal contradiction adds necessary grit to her character, preventing her from becoming purely saintly, and her choice to "teach" him rather than fight is earned by her established observational habit.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—claustrophobia versus the need to master fear—is rendered with visceral specificity. The pivot to the final risk is beautifully motivated by the "bunker builder's child" identity, grounding a fantastical quest in a concrete psychological need. The father-child dynamic effectively balances instruction with agency, allowing the protagonist to earn the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer; his motivation ("teach silence how to comfort") is deftly anchored in the specific backstory of his mother, giving weight to his actions. The interplay between his internal philosophy and his external use of the meter creates a rich, specific character portrait. Mara's grief provides necessary resistance, and her shift is earned through their interaction rather than authorial fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ione is a functional protagonist whose motivation is clear ("to find the stairway"), but she lacks internal friction. The trait "wisely adventurous" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; her refusal of the throne feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle, reducing the character arc to a smooth, low-stakes procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara functions effectively as a mythic archetype, but the emotional arc relies on diagnostic summary ("needed to show him how to live inside absence") rather than embodied struggle. Lio serves more as a symbolic prop than a fully realized character, reducing the visceral impact of their interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s internal landscape of shame and redemption is vividly drawn, anchoring the fantastical premise in genuine emotion. Her transition from scammer to healer is compelling, though her immunity to the "slogans" temptation feels slightly too robust, missing a chance for deeper struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leander is a strongly drawn focalizer whose "eloquently silent" nature consistently informs his actions and the climax. His motivation—to trade a throne for truth and restitution—is compelling, and the final renunciation provides high-stakes definition. While the "bridge of intuition" serves as a slightly convenient internal mechanism for a plot leap, his agency in dismantling his own legacy is impactful and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calven's interiority is effectively externalized through the marionette, creating a tight thematic mirroring that dramatizes his internal conflict without excessive exposition. The "shaking heart" versus "steady hand" establishes his withdrawn nature immediately, and his choice to unsnap the armor is a earned, character-specific action that resolves his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is inextricably linked to the plot; her specific grief ("empty bed") acts as the lens through which she solves the puzzle. The motivation ("magnify small kindnesses") is not just a trait but the engine of the inciting incident and resolution. Her tactful hope creates a distinct, resilient voice that earns the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s internal landscape of resistance is compelling, and her motivation to fight erasure is palpable. However, the attribute of "careful resourcefulness" is undercut at the climax when she relies on the "absurd" luck of a phone booth key opening a press truck, rather than a resourceful solution to a barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lio’s internal conflict—saving the town versus preserving his mother’s echo—drives a climax where the renunciation is tangible and costly. The "vested hush" functions beautifully as both a physical tool and an emotional burden, grounding the mythic stakes in a specific, painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lio serves as a sympathetic fable archetype but lacks the internal contradiction or specific emotional cost required for depth. His motivation is clear, but the "transformation into hope" feels like a label applied by the narrator rather than an earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal state ("uncertainly certain") effectively drives the final bargain. Her choice to negotiate rather than merely retrieve the object is a strong character beat that redefines success. However, her motivation is slightly abstract, narrated more than felt until the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is distinct and embodied, with the cost of her magic (“childhood loosen”) felt viscerally on the page. Her choice to sacrifice a piece of her own identity to solve the case demonstrates high agency and aligns perfectly with her philosophy of balance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a distinct, engaging protagonist with a motivation (healing via laughter) that drives every beat. The parallel between her past as a midwife and Elowen’s trauma creates a specific, earned internal resonance. The emotional logic—that absurdity can crack calcified grief—feels psychologically acute and is dramatized effectively in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The somatic nature of the character's interiority ("joints report angle like a confession") is brilliant, grounding the high-concept premise in visceral experience. The final psychological pivot is earned by this specific embodiment of trauma, satisfying the 9+ standard for contradictory impulses resolved with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal contradiction or a high-stakes trade-off. While the motivation to "honor overlooked histories" is clear, it reads as a noble label rather than a conflicted drive tested by genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn through competence and a distinct, weary voice ("responsibility without a body"). The blend of technical expertise with supernatural sensitivity creates a unique, embodied perspective. While the self-description ("I am skillfully observant") leans slightly on telling, it is immediately redeemed by the concrete action of analyzing dust.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio’s internal conflict—trusting the system while fearing its perfection—drives the narrative. His professional competence (reading frost proofs) seamlessly integrates with his personal grief, making the final choice to rupture the catalog feel earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Len’s transition from "defunct relic" to "unwilling curator" is earned through specific, motivated choices rooted in his past. The "poet's habit" trait is functionally integrated into his perception and the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivo is a distinct, empathetic protagonist whose profession actively shapes his perception ("read the mood of metal"). His motivation is clear, but the internal cost of using the forbidden stone is intellectual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The resolution relies on his competence without forcing a painful trade-off or deep character alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a unique vocation that informs her worldview ("labels rain by street"). Her motivation ("to find the place where explanations fail") drives the narrative clearly. However, the internal landscape is somewhat static; her "eccentricity" functions more as a trait label than a source of frictional choice or contradictory impulse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's thematic requirements rather than a living character; her transition from lost hiker to supernatural collaborator is instantaneous and lacks emotional friction. Internal states are often summarized ("half laughing, half terrified") rather than embodied, and her competence faces no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lina is consistent but functions primarily as a vessel for the plot's scavenger hunt rather than a character under pressure. Her interiority is summarized ("began to reckon") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The lack of active struggle or meaningful flaws results in a smooth, low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("trained to treat paper as evidence," "motivation was not heroism") rather than embodied reaction. The interaction with Lila is summarized, preventing the dramatization of the emotional struggle or the "searing reverie" mentioned in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sen is a strongly defined protagonist with a clear internal philosophy (rejecting false comfort) that drives the plot. His internal discipline is rendered well ("false comfort as poison"), but the secondary characters (the woman, the families) function more as archetypes to facilitate the fable-like progression rather than distinct individuals exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    Erem is a compelling protagonist with distinct interiority, but his pivot from terror to solution relies on an intellectual leap ("patterns suggest a loophole") rather than an emotional struggle or costly choice. The internal conflict is resolved too neatly, bypassing the potential for a deeper crisis of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio is a distinct, internalized protagonist whose motivation to understand his inheritance drives the narrative. The shift from seeking the "texture of time" to accepting the "burden of order" creates a clear, earned arc. The oxymoronic state "furiously tranquil" is used twice, reading slightly more as a label than a dramatized emotion, but his competence as a seed saver grounds the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris displays strong agency, driving the resolution through technical competence and a distinct moral choice. Her motivation to "favor listening" is effectively dramatized in her actions, though the repetition of the label "credibly curious" twice feels like a forced tell rather than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio is a distinct, sympathetic focalizer, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("wanted to find strength in vulnerability," "act of naming hurt"). This over-articulation distances the reader from the embodied experience of his grief, telling us how he categorizes his emotions rather than letting them play out in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from hoarding silence to releasing it is poignant and well-motivated by the sister's arrival. The shift is earned through specific observation and memory, though the self-definition as "astonished recluse" feels slightly expository initially.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli is a distinct, melancholic focalizer whose motivation—to understand time's texture before his death—is effectively dramatized. The renunciation of the urn is a credible, high-cost choice that earns the shift in his state, though his acceptance of the new duty feels slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    Rian lacks internal contradiction or flaws; his benevolence meets no resistance, rendering him a static vehicle for the theme rather than a character under pressure. He pays no emotional or physical cost for his choices, resolving every "struggle" with immediate competence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the "brazen calm" effectively establishes a stoic emotional shield, but the heavy reliance on narrative summary creates distance. The reader is told of her physical struggle ("chest ached") and resolve rather than witnessing micro-choices or visceral reactions in a dramatized moment. The characterization feels more mythic and remote than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's "luminous skeptic" persona is not merely a label but drives the central inquiry and the final theft. The skepticism translates into concrete actions—bypassing filters, analyzing the footprints—rather than just attitude. The internal tension between the lure of "homecoming" and the rigorous need for "chemistry" is resolved through a specific, earned disillusionment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is sharply defined through professional competence ("not for prayer, but for work") rather than standard emotional melodrama, which fits the ritualistic tone perfectly. Interiority is grounded in the specific "Gloom Hill" worldview, decoding the environment through a unique lens. The character feels lived-in and distinct, though the lack of a deeper personal vulnerability or sharper internal conflict prevents a push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s scent-based perception is distinct, and Morrow acts as a strong emotional anchor. However, assigning the dog the complex abstract agency to "bark at lies" rather than at the physical threat creates a sentimental break in the grounded characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn as a "blessed pariah," a trait that organically motivates their isolation and unique capability. Interiority is vivid and specific, grounding the sci-fi elements in personal loss. The explicit articulation of desire ("knew what I wanted: to turn confusion into exploration") is the only slight lapse in an otherwise shown-not-told character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype whose "chivalry" functions more as a stylistic quirk than a source of genuine conflict or cost. The "chivalrous" choices (offering a flask, knocking a guard out "gently") lower the stakes rather than complicating the heist, resulting in a character who feels safe rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's dual nature as crisis actor and real survivor creates deep internal tension that drives the plot. The "benevolently ruthless" trait is not just a label but is dramatized in the pivotal choice to split the archive bundles, and the motivation to document "small gestures" earns the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    Character motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding memory is embodied well ("tasting metal"). However, the protagonist's primary capability—the "maker of names"—is introduced via dialogue exposition rather than demonstrated action early on, making its resurgence at the climax feel slightly convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s internal arc from arrogance to "fierce repose" and forgiveness is compelling and well-dramatized through the chess metaphor. The pivot from "winning" to "offering a draw" provides a strong, character-specific resolution. However, the recurring trait "fidgets productively" feels mechanically inserted and slightly jarring against the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the plot inevitably toward a high-cost resolution. The protagonist's defiance and specific trait ("innocently mischievous") are dramatized effectively in the opening beat, though internal conflict during the execution phase is low.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's internal landscape of guilt is vivid, though the "uncertainty" trait is stated more than dramatized; she acts with ritualistic competence throughout. The transition from regret to self-forgiveness is clear but relies on an internal monologue that borders on diagnostic label-speak ("lied to myself that alchemy was control") rather than purely embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lio's internal conflict is compelling, but the pivot from aloofness to vulnerability relies heavily on diagnostic interiority ("distance was not dignity but fear") rather than purely dramatized pressure. The emotional arc is clear, but the epiphany feels slightly summarized rather than fully earned through scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrator's interiority is lush and embodied ("hands shook with a softer kind of thunder"), establishing a clear emotional drive. However, Jonas functions primarily as a recipient of the lesson rather than a fully realized agent with competing pressure until the very end. The relationship dynamics are fable-like, prioritizing the thematic argument over gritty interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s identity as a "patchwork navigator" provides a distinct, lyrical filter for the narrative, establishing a voice consistent with the fable-like tone. However, the character functions more as an archetype than a deeply conflicted individual; their choice to stay and help is stated rather than tested by significant doubt or counter-pressure. The interaction with Sera adds necessary humanity, but the protagonist's internal arc remains relatively static, defined by competence and role rather than a difficult transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a sharply defined protagonist whose "involuntary truth" acts as a rigorous constraint, driving the plot rather than just coloring it. Her rationality is active, demonstrated through her research into "discredited textbooks" and her testing of the eye, which establishes strong agency. The choice to embrace secrecy at the end is a character-specific evolution that feels earned by the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eamon is a vivid, specific creation whose internal method ("observing gaps") perfectly matches his external actions, creating a unity of character and plot. The narrator serves as an effective, grounded foil who amplifies Eamon’s isolation without stealing focus, and Eamon's specific limit—never seeing whole memories—adds necessary friction to his competence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s specific trait ("empirically intuitive") is actively used to solve plot problems (decoding the chip, following the ants), grounding her agency. Her final decision to reject the "wet" path is a credible, character-specific rejection of inherited burdens, though the emotional weight of leaving Ellis is resolved somewhat quickly given the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maelin’s internal conflict between the safety of prophecy and the terror of agency is dramatized effectively. The final choice to sacrifice the throne is earned by her earlier disenchantment, and the cost is visibly paid in physical pain and status loss. The relationship with Rovan serves as a functional crucible, highlighting her resolve when she commands him to stand down.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s internal drive (capturing presence) and external choice (defying the Academy) are well-integrated, creating a character who feels consistent and motivated. The relationship with Toma provides an effective crucible for the decision, grounding the high-concept magic in personal loyalty. The "pocketed light tightened" reaction brilliantly embodies the internal conflict between art and commodification without needing dialogue exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is sharply defined by the "chronological confusion," driving active agency rather than passive observation. The shift from "jealousy of past selves" to gratitude is a psychologically distinct, non-cliché arc that earns the resolution. The internal voice is specific and textured, merging the professional detachment of a chronicler with visceral personal panic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    Iris's compensatory motivation (replacing scent with visual deduction) is compelling and drives her agency. However, the resolution relies on secondary characters yielding instantly and perfectly to her intervention, which feels slightly diagnostic and unearned by the brief interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ila’s internal conflict—shame versus craft—is perfectly integrated with the magic system, driving the climax where she uses a personal superstition to solve a technical crisis. The "fourth circle" choice acts as a character-specific pivot that earns the resolution without relying on external rescue. The mentor provides a nudge, but the agency and cost (reliving the brother's injury) remain strictly Ila's.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marin’s duality as columnist and exorcist creates compelling internal friction that drives the ritual. Her guilt is palpable, and the choice to prioritize spiritual restitution over physical preservation—saving the meaning rather than the trees—is a profound, character-defining renunciation earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's role as a witness is clear, and the internal struggle against "drowning in myself" provides a functional anchor. However, the characterization remains largely archetypal; emotions are often summarized ("feared," "hoped") rather than dramatized through specific, embodied reactions to the illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ivar is a compelling, idiosyncratic protagonist with a distinct worldview ("spoke to pipes like sheep") and grounded motivation. However, the inspector functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character; his rapid emotional pivot from anger to cooperation lacks the internal friction or distinct voice established for Ivar.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena is drawn with distinct sensory interiority ("pressure of its corners"), establishing a unique worldview. However, the climax relies on emotional summary ("felt the quiet wildfire of anger and relief") rather than dramatized struggle to motivate her betrayal of the farm, making the pivotal choice feel slightly rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—counting versus gambling, order versus the father's chaos—is dramatized effectively through the scavenger hunt. The shift from resentment to understanding ("a lesson aimed at me") is a well-earned resonant reconfiguration. The "theoretically rebellious" trait feels slightly more told than shown, but the final choice to engage with the father creates genuine intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s internal conflict—safety in estrangement versus the desire for connection—is externalized masterfully through her job. The inciting call forces her to confront her own hypocrisy ("watering that estrangement"), leading to a choice that feels inevitable yet carries significant emotional cost (breaking her safety protocol). The characterization is distinct, empathetic, and drives the plot without reliance on exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict—torn between her bureaucratic complicity and her desire for truth—is palpably rendered through the sensory details of her trade ("smelled of tannins"). Her transformation from a writer of "tidy chains" to a witness of "proximate causes" is earned via specific memories and the physical proof of the locket. The choice to publicly dismantle her own prior work demonstrates agency with high personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is vividly characterized with specific, contradictory traits ("bright but hungry," "jokes the way others made fire") that drive the narrative. The pivot revealing her as a fellow patient rather than just a provider adds significant depth and reframes the relationship dynamics effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iris’s sensory translation of the world is compelling, grounding her motivation in specific, embodied experience rather than abstract longing. The moment she touches the stone and feels "panic" effectively dramatizes her internal conflict, though the emotional transition from that panic to the lullaby feels slightly expedited.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a distinct, internalized protagonist whose professional competence dovetails neatly with her personal regret. The pivot relies on an explicit character trait ("confidently uncertain") that feels slightly diagnostic when "loosening certainty" becomes the mechanical solution. However, the emotional logic holds, and her choice to edit with kindness rather than erasure is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the theme than a fully realized agent; their primary state is a passive "erasure" guided almost entirely by Aster until the final gesture. While the internal ache is described, the emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("soft ache," "joyful sorrow") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized through difficult choices. The lack of resistance or agency until the very end limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera’s transition from arsonist to preservationist creates a compelling internal arc, grounded in a clear motivation to redeem a past promise. However, her competence is occasionally established through summary (e.g., "analytically intuitive") rather than dramatized struggle, making some beats feel smoother than the emotional stakes suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shared grief between the protagonist and Sato creates a compelling, mirrored internal landscape. The protagonist's shift from "guinea pig" to co-conspirator is earned through the shared vulnerability of the memory-meld, though the "rebellion" manifests more as a shared coping mechanism than a sharp conflict of interest.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s competence is rendered through specific sensory details—recognizing gaits, folding maps—which grounds her authority immediately. The choice to reveal her secret conduit to save the stevedore serves as a meaningful character turn, trading personal advantage for public safety. Len functions primarily as a skeptical foil, but his reactions are consistent and serve the pressure well.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Guardian's motivation of "silent empathy" is dramatized effectively through action rather than dialogue. The Girl's internal state is vivid, though her "half-spoken secret" feels slightly archetypal. The interaction is compelling, though the emotional weight relies heavily on the lyrical framing rather than raw character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Eli is an archetype of virtuous patience rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or flaws that complicate his choices. The trait of hearing "unspoken words" functions as a convenient shortcut to bypass dramatizing relationships or tension. Because he faces no internal hesitation and meets no resistance that forces a difficult trade-off, his agency feels preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator possesses a distinct, lyrical interiority that fits the fable-like tone. However, Captain Rusk's emotional pivot is precipitous and reliant on the magical object's influence, reducing the complexity of the interpersonal struggle to a mechanical unlocking.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary; Orin’s duality as a healer and former regime enforcer creates a sophisticated, embodied moral conflict. The protagonist’s internal state is specific ("carried her last laugh like a bruise"), and the shift from resistance to shared ritual is earned by the on-page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s motivation is intensely embodied and drives the plot’s central mechanic (paraphrase); her refusal to accept the boundary is earned by the specific grief for her brother. The "certainty" felt in her teeth grounds the magical aptitude in physical sensation, avoiding abstract competence. Her choice to dissolve into air at the end demonstrates a profound, character-specific cost (loss of self/form) that feels inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s defining trait—colorblindness—is not just cosmetic; it actively drives her bargaining tactic and the story's central insight about texture over hue. While the "innocently cunning" label is slightly expository, her actions in the plant negotiation dramatize this duality perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and the bell ringer's philosophical stance is well-drawn. However, Mara's transformation from skeptical auditor to co-conspirator happens largely through summary ("Strict posture loosening"), and their emotional calibration feels too seamless, lacking the friction of genuine opposing worldviews.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's internal landscape is rich with grief metaphors, but her shift from despair to purpose is largely narrated via summary rather than dramatized through resistant choices in scene. The lack of direct dialogue and the passive acceptance of Sen's instructions distance the reader from the specific emotional pivot during the interaction with Lysa.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character motivations are sharply defined; Aurel’s shame regarding his past use of the method provides excellent depth. The dynamic moves from guardedness to shared purpose without forcing conflict, and the narrator’s specific trait of being "steadily curious" effectively drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, driven by a clear, conflicted motivation (forbidden knowledge vs. safety). The internal shift—from seeking knowledge to managing its burden—is earned through the climax and solidified by the final choice to lie to the elders and alter teaching methods. The cost of "loss of innocence" is tangible in the final behavior change.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s agency drives the resolution through specific investigation and ritual, and she pays a personal cost (her unshared memory) to solve the conflict. However, her interiority relies heavily on repeated prompt phrases ("luminous regret") rather than varied emotional texture, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s internal conflict—wanting to burn bridges versus the reality of the hungry animals—is visceral and drives the scene. The transformation from naive victim to a handler with a "spine" is earned through specific, on-page micro-choices (the lists, the call) rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara's desire for "stories in scars" drives the narrative effectively, but her physical capacity to tunnel through stone foundation immediately post-surgery contradicts her established vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is deeply realized, blending professional cynicism ("burglar of light") with vulnerability. Her specific compulsion—the looping lyrics—anchors the magical premise in personal need, and her choice to use her own letters in the ritual creates a strong emotional bridge that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sel functions as a consistent focalizer whose specific attribute of hearing unspoken words effectively drives the diagnosis of the problem, but the character lacks internal complexity. The narrative presents no contradictory impulses or genuine dilemmas; Sel performs the ritual with competent certainty, and the choice to "rest" rather than fight encounters no obstacles or meaningful costs. Consequently, the protagonist feels more like a functional vessel for the magic system than a fully realized character navigating a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist displays strong agency, making a sacrificial choice ("let the wave functions split me") that directly addresses the central problem. Motivation is clear and poignant, though the emotional interiority is slightly subordinated to the high-concept mechanics. The "dreamless" state serves as an effective, consistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is distinct ("rediscover the wild frontier of my mind") and shapes the narrative voice. Interiority is vivid, though the articulation of fears ("need for applause," "certainty") leans slightly on diagnostic labeling, rescued by immediate grounding in physical metaphors (clockwork orchids, magnets).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority connects effectively to the "leashes" backstory, grounding the fantastical events in character-specific regret. The guides serve as effective foils, though the realization of courage "waiting in her ribs" feels slightly more sentimental than dramatized by the prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is sharply drawn, moving from compliance to transgression through a specific, earned realization about the nature of the "silent choir." The internal conflict between safety and the moral cost of silence is dramatized effectively in the decision to speak the note name.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orun functions as a competent archetypal figure rather than a fully realized character; while his "regally unpretentious" trait informs the ending, his lack of internal conflict or struggle under pressure leaves him static.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s interiority is distinct, grounding her transition from witness to protector in a specific history of loss. The internal conflict is vivid, though the shift from passive observer to active conspirator relies on a summarized middle phase rather than a fully dramatized turning point beat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilya is distinct with sensory-grounded traits ("barefoot," "refused boots") that imply vulnerability and specific worldview. However, the specific trait "awkwardly confident" is repeated as a label three times rather than dramatized through distinct micro-actions during the decoding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Nara is a compelling figure with grounded motivation ("evolve tradition with intent") and a history that shapes her actions. However, the narrator functions largely as a plot device; the self-diagnosis of being "accidentally telepathic" lacks embodied discovery and flattens the character's internal experience into a label.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mina’s trauma is embodied through specific physical details rather than mere labels, and her competence is balanced by genuine struggle during the drone incident. The choice to bury the photograph serves as a powerful, earned renunciation that solidifies her resilience without erasing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s internal conflict between perfectionism and fractured reality is compelling, and the shift from abstract artistic frustration to the specific grief for her sister grounds the stakes. However, the reliance on rhetorical questions in her interiority ("Wasn't that what art was...?") tends to articulate her arc diagnostically rather than letting it emerge solely through the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Keir is a competent protagonist with distinct interiority, particularly in his management of panic ("world thickened"). However, the defining traits "consciously wild" and "serene anger" function more as static labels or mantras than fully dramatized emotional ranges until the final beat, slightly limiting character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist displays agency, but the interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("I was bravely conflicted") rather than dramatized struggle. This "tell-y" insertion flattens the pivotal decision-making moment, reducing the emotional complexity to a declared state.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maris is a distinct, consistent focalizer, but Tarek’s rapid transformation from hardened bounty hunter to pacifist planter feels slightly idealized. His "softening" upon entering the dome and his susceptibility to the talisman border on magical rather than psychological, bypassing the grit of genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rovan is a compelling, highly competent protagonist whose internal logic drives the narrative. The pivot from hunter to protector is earned through the realization of the echo's nature, transforming a potential "competence porn" piece into a story of renunciation. The choice to release the prize feels authentic to his cool-headed characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Celeste’s internal conflict—her father’s legacy of error versus her own need for accuracy—is expertly externalized through the prop of the rosewood nib. Her decision to "intervene" rather than destroy aligns perfectly with this established motivation. The choice to forego the sensational headline for the "quiet report" is a decisive character beat that proves her growth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s internal landscape of guilt is vividly drawn, and his decision to tattoo himself in the climax serves as a profound, character-specific exercise of agency. The choice to use his art to "tether" the device grounds the fantastical resolution in his established identity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inez is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, and her artist's perspective filters the narrative effectively. However, her "whimsical" nature borders on the "magical artist" trope, and her internal struggle is minimal; she succeeds without confronting a significant personal flaw or making a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Samir is a compelling protagonist whose physical "gentle radicalism" (the Grasp) drives the narrative. Lina serves as a strong foil, though her pivot from vengeance to cooperation relies partly on the convenient identity of the arsonist (her cousin) rather than pure persuasion, slightly softening the character conflict's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s synesthetic interiority is distinct and grounded, but the climatic invocation of her father lacks prior setup, reading as a convenient emotional lever rather than an earned release. The "brink of despair" motivation connects well to the resolution, but the shared synesthesia with the ghost feels like a coincidental shortcut to rapport.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is a distinct, proactive protagonist whose "affectionate skeptic" trait is not merely labeled but operationalized in the climax (hugging the lawyer to disarm a threat). Her motivation to prioritize people over dogmas drives the plot logically from the studio test to the public exhibit. The internal shift from skepticism to advocacy feels earned through the empirical evidence she gathers, though her internal conflict is resolved somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is tightly integrated with professional identity; Mina’s shift from observer to participant is earned through specific sensory interiority. The choice to abandon her mother’s gift to comfort the entity demonstrates a profound reconfiguration of her values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lysa functions as a fable archetype rather than a fully realized literary character; she lacks the internal contradiction and contradictory impulses required for high-band interiority. Her motivation is clear but singular ("spin a prophecy"), and she faces no significant internal obstacles or difficult micro-choices that reveal depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rina's characterization relies on the "stoic professional" archetype, but her internal logic falters with the "rubbing salt on raw burns" beat. It is unclear if the burns are literal or metaphorical; if literal, the physiological reaction (steadying rather than disabling pain) breaks immersion, and if metaphorical, the physical action is nonsensical.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.3)
    Rowan is a compelling protagonist whose internal grief is expertly externalized through his trade tools (needle, reins). His motivation is singular and drives the plot; he actively forces the climax by refusing to drive until the truth is spoken. The interaction with Senn reveals deep status dynamics, shifting from servant/master to creditor/debtor with tangible tension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Galen is a clearly drawn, competent protagonist whose specific worldview ("potter's mind") drives his interaction with the anomaly. While his internal struggle is subordinate to the external mystery, his competence is actionable rather than proclaimed, and his interaction with Sera adds necessary human stakes to the metaphysical problem.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on adjective-labeling ("wistfully pragmatic," "careful people") rather than revealing traits through friction or difficult choices. Mara's motivation ("fear without a task") is compelling but resolved too easily by immediate agreement, lacking the internal resistance or contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Internal conflict between past guilt and present need for independence is vivid and drives the narrative. The climax—speaking to the "hunters" to unlock the sundial—demonstrates strong agency, though the resulting instructions feel slightly like a reward rather than a direct consequence of the character's flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's central conflict hinges on a contrived backstory (ghostwriting an apology to oneself without the client/lover acknowledging the connection) that strains psychological realism. The self-labeled trait "inevitably whimsical" is told as an aside rather than demonstrated through significant choice or action. While the internal state is described, the mechanics of the relationship drama feel more like fable-logic than human behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a highly competent, agentic protagonist whose internal state (“grin she did not quite trust”) effectively mirrors the external tension. However, the antagonists (the button-wearing manager and the funding-threatening chair) read as stock obstacles rather than fully realized characters. Additionally, the pivotal realization about the “cosmic tricksters” relies on summarized backstory (reading old logs) rather than an on-page discovery, which slightly distances the reader from the moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The claustrophobia is functionally integrated, constraining method (sound over sight), but the "prudently adventurous" trait feels told rather than fully dramatized in complex choices. The mentor functions as an expository prop rather than a character with distinct agency, and the protagonist’s internal state relies on label-emotions ("wistful rebellion") rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's face blindness is a compelling, specific constraint that shapes the narrative method effectively. However, the antagonist, Maren, lacks depth; she capitulates instantly upon confrontation, functioning more as a plot device than a character with genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal landscape is often summarized ("nervously confident") rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. While she is proactive in solving the puzzle, she faces no genuine character-level dilemma; her victory is total and lacks the psychological cost or transformation required for higher bands. The protagonist functions more as a vehicle for the scavenger hunt than a fully realized agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is articulated via summary ("I understood my own motive... to sculpt possibility") rather than dramatized through conflict or hesitation. The protagonist's decision to erase their identity feels too smooth, lacking the friction or internal cost expected for such a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator has a distinct voice and consistent motivation, but the synopsis-like mode prevents deep engagement with contradictory impulses in real-time. The "polished calm" is stated rather than dramatized through embodied reaction under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator is functionally competent but lacks dramatized internal struggle or genuine flaws; the self-description "said to heal with words" feels self-aggrandizing and reduces the emotional stakes of the interaction with Nera. The protagonist solves the central emotional conflict too easily by "naming grief plainly," which reads as summary rather than a scene of earned connection. The characterization leans heavily on stated traits rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thalen’s competence and &quot;warlike serenity&quot; create a distinct, consistent protagonist whose specific skills (Finding, druidic chant) drive the plot naturally. The &quot;Finder&quot; trait is well-integrated into his worldview rather than just a label, justifying why the seed finds him. However, his emotional distance—&quot;sworn to keep my voice calm&quot;—limits the sense of personal risk or internal struggle, making him more of a functional archetype than a vulnerable character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysa’s motivation is immediate and sharply defined, driving her to accept significant physical cost (re-opening the scar) without hesitation. The internal conflict between fear and purpose is efficiently established, though the reunion with the mother feels slightly rushed emotionally compared to the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s defining traits (“reckless idealist,” “fiercely gentle”) act as the crucible for the story’s central moral choice. Her refusal to steal a destiny, despite her desperation, perfectly dramatizes the "fiercely gentle" attribute, while the self-sacrificial bargain earns the "reckless" descriptor with high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's internal arc—from using facts as emotional insulation to embracing the "after-applause hush"—is compelling and well-motivated. The dual identity of roadie/appraiser creates a unique filter for processing grief, though Marla's role is primarily catalytic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exemplary; Nerin's professional background as a translator is not merely a label but the cognitive lens through which he processes grief and physics. This integration of skill and emotional arc creates a unique interiority where "grammatical markers" explain metaphysical events, making the final choice deep and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is deep and character-specific, anchored by the physical constraint of the titan-gear and the neoprene-clad trembling. The protagonist’s internal struggle—balancing the city's wonders against their own eroding memory—leads to a choice that accepts a permanent cost ("new moon had eaten that part of me"). The final acceptance of the "Keeper" title feels earned by the prior labor of smelting and archiving.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s transition from bureaucrat to healer is compelling, and the widower’s vulnerability is well-dramatized ("face cracked open"). However, his shift from desperate secrecy to full cooperation moves rapidly, relying more on the magical catalyst than a fully earned internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's "chronicler" persona creates a distinct, embodied interiority, and the grief is palpably rendered through the accordion. However, agency wavers at the climax; the protagonist is led to the solution by a convenient external clue rather than active deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, actively decoding the library’s cipher to resolve his internal conflict rather than passively receiving wisdom. While the "veiled dreamer" persona creates a slight fable-like distance, the emotional pivot—choosing to write the unspoken apology—is well-earned through the specific labor of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—bureaucratic duty versus ecological loyalty—is dramatized vividly through the plant telepathy. Her choice to sabotage the certification is earned by the specific vision of the burnt roots, grounding the abstract "dream" motivation in urgent, felt stakes. The cost is acknowledged in the acceptance of "holes" in her own life, marking a clear ethical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s motivation is seamlessly integrated with her professional identity, driving the ritualistic action and the final choice to release rather than hoard the spark. Her internal landscape—translating static into maps—feels idiosyncratic and deeply embodied, grounding the magical elements in character-specific skill.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a distinct, internally consistent protagonist whose professional precision mirrors her emotional state. Her transition from "seeking prize" to "cultivating practice" is a well-earned psychological shift, though the initial motivation feels slightly expository in the opening narration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a compelling, specific protagonist whose profession ("conscience for hire") creates immediate internal tension. Her choice to assume the burden of doubt rather than purely servicing the client’s denial is a strong, character-driven pivot. The shift from "sincerely insincere" validation to honest vulnerability marks a clear arc.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sato’s backwards aging is not merely cosmetic but drives the narrative urgency and the poignancy of the final sacrifice. The narrator’s agency, defined by focused attention and the endurance of the magnetic pressure, earns the final transfer of the "burden of truth" with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Oren’s physicality as a basalt entity is grounded and distinct, and his reverence for history informs his worldview effectively. However, the narrative relies on competence without significant internal contradiction or emotional cost; his success feels inevitable rather than earned through deep struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Davin's internal landscape of "inkless fingers" and hunger for imperfect creation drives every beat. The choice to unstrap the harness is a profound moment of renunciation—trading safety for the "real"—that perfectly sets up the final, humble ritual of the petals. The character arc from seeking the object to valuing the act of making is executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is abstract ("color of sound") and established through exposition rather than interaction or choice. While the internal conflict ("honesty as a screen") is stated, it lacks dramatic friction; the character faces no interpersonal pressure or genuine dilemma, merely following a linear path to a revelation provided by a magical object.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s agency is absolute; she translates abstract "purpose" into high-risk engineering decisions (splitting the dish) against crew resistance. Her "quiet enthusiasm" operates as a tangible constraint on her behavior, driving her to act when others freeze, and the final realization of the loop is deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and enacted through the ritual, but the opening relies on explicit self-labeling ("I am a heartbroken reaper") rather than dramatization. The interiority occasionally leans on abstract metaphors ("hollow that grief has carved") instead of specific, embodied memory, though the connection to the recordings grounds the character well.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Evin’s worldview (the universe as a ledger) drives unique interiority and motivates the plot effectively. The "brittle devotion" trait is dramatized via the steward’s challenge, forcing a meaningful micro-choice, though the phrase itself appears as a label before being shown. The shift from wavering to confidence is earned through the ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s voice is distinct, and her internal conflict between the warden’s duty ("expunge") and the storyteller’s duty ("spin stories") is well-calibrated. The motivation is clear and drives the plot. The emotional processing of betraying her father’s legacy is handled primarily through retrospective summary rather than dramatized hesitation, which keeps the emotional cost slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s internal conflict between logic and sentiment is clearly dramatized, but the resolution relies on a somewhat convenient external trigger (starlings) rather than a painful internal tradeoff. While interiority is specific, the use of diagnostic labeling ("secretly sentimental") slightly distances the reader from the embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict between the urge to accuse and the duty to verify is articulated through specific, embodied action (the buckle). The choice to prioritize the "web of trust" over personal justice (sparing the thief) demonstrates a hierarchy of values with a clear moral cost. Motivation is consistent, and competence is balanced by the heavy burden of the role.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with numbness is well-articulated and drives the narrative arc toward connection. The "ego death" backstory provides a strong foundation for the voice, though the "numbness" functions slightly more as a labeled state than a fully dramatized obstacle until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but the narrative summary distance prevents deep interior access or visceral reactions during the climax. The conflict is processed intellectually through "telling" (e.g., "I decided to investigate") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure. The interaction with the antagonist is summarized ("As she talked, I asked questions"), which flattens the potential for status dynamics or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Bram is a deeply realized protagonist; his specific grief ("tending to the unspoken is like watering a plant you cannot see") anchors the surreal premise in emotional truth. The "wife who speaks only in errands" is a devastatingly efficient characterization that justifies the stakes. His desperate, ritualistic competence with the machines creates a unique and compelling agency.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivations are sharply defined; the narrator's shift from homesickness to curiosity is earned through the interaction, not just stated. The guardian's transition from feral defense to shared vulnerability is dramatized effectively in the "pacing" and "shoulders hunched" beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara is defined by abstract labels like "hopeless" and "stoically sensitive" rather than embodied traits; her internal struggle is summarized rather than dramatized. Jun functions as a convenient prop who converts instantly to Mara's worldview, lacking the resistance or complexity to generate true relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is a highly competent protagonist whose internal drive ("find the beginning in every ending") perfectly motivates her external actions. The contradiction between her role as a preserver and her choice to dismantle the mast creates a sophisticated, earned resolution. Her agency is absolute, driving the plot from the tuning to the final physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lina demonstrates strong agency and competence, particularly in using her trade skills to resolve the crisis. However, her core motivation (“so nobody had to disappear alone”) is explicitly stated in summary rather than dramatized through prior specific loss or interaction, limiting emotional weight. The "workman's nod" at the climax is an excellent, character-specific beat that grounds the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—imposing "rational enchantment" on a fevered mind—is distinct and compels the narrative arc. The shift from a desire for control to the acceptance of a raw, uncurated connection is earned through specific, embodied memories (the scalpel, the lung).

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is beautifully distinct, blending professional competence with a specific, poetic curiosity. Her internal state ("humble and fierce") drives the plot efficiently. However, the secondary character, Jae, functions largely as a prop, and the Council’s role as antagonist is resolved too abstractly to test Mara’s character deeper than the intellectual level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is inextricably linked to the magic system and plot; Mara's personal history (the fire) serves as the crucible for the climax. Her choice to intervene is specific, embodying a "protector" role that costs her emotional comfort, and her internal state ("throat full of ash") remains visceral throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is visceral, moving beyond a label to shape her perception ("throat of stone," "measuring distance... like a debt") and raising the cost of the pivotal squeeze. Her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is tightly woven into her actions, grounding the speculative elements in genuine emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is brilliantly anchored by the "counting heartbeats" trait, which serves as both a measure of fear and a mechanism for closure. Her motivation is visceral—a fight for existence against a bureaucratic erasure—and the shift from counting to stopping feels earned and emotionally resonant. The interaction with Lyle highlights her vulnerability without reducing her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ilen is a competent, mythic archetype whose motivation is clear and singular ("obsession"), fitting the fable mode. However, he lacks deep internal contradiction or a distinct "want versus need" dynamic; his struggle is almost entirely technical (solving the echo) rather than interpersonal or moral, limiting character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s shift from observer to participant is earned via the escalating threat, and Jonas’s internal struggle between bitterness and humanity is dramatized effectively. The swift alliance between Mara and Edda upon the badge reveal is efficient, though a moment of friction there would have deepened the professional stakes. Jonas's decision to weaponize his bitterness as a "punchline" provides a distinct, character-specific resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio is a compelling protagonist with a specifically drawn interiority ("gap between knowing and understanding"). His motivation to "reawaken beauty" is grounded in the backstory of his father, giving weight to his rebellion. The choice to enter the orchard carries clear risk, and his actions consistently align with his established skills and drive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivo is a compelling protagonist whose respectfully rebellious nature drives the plot effectively. His motivation is clear and dramatized through the specific action of carrying "useless" mail and his choice to expend a precious resource (the bottle) for Nela. The ending reflects a genuine internal shift ("healing did not mean undoing"), though this realization is delivered via summary rather than purely through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, and the backstory of silence effectively shapes his worldview. However, the resolution where he begins to "sing" despite his established muteness feels like a convenient contradiction rather than a dramatized evolution of capacity, slightly undercutting the character's core constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a distinct, internally consistent protagonist whose transition from observer to active participant is well-motivated by her intellectual curiosity. The realization that her loneliness was a "closed system" anchors the character arc effectively, providing emotional weight to the cerebral plot. While the internal conflict is somewhat retrospective rather than driving the scene's peak, the shift in stance at the closure is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mina’s motivation and method are compelling and distinct. The climax relies on a diagnostic interior summary ("realized her dream had been running because...") which intellectualizes the epiphany rather than letting the embodied action carry the full emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the narrative from the opening line to the resolution. The protagonist’s internal conflict—the desire to create versus the fear of speaking—is externalized effectively through the ritual. The interaction with the locksmith balances guidance with the protagonist's necessary participation (naming the star), though the locksmith's tools shoulder much of the mechanical burden of the change. The emotional cost (the loss of protective laughter) is a strong, earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lissa’s motivation is clearly drawn, and her internal conflict (scholar vs. participant) drives the narrative efficiently. The shift from the safety of counting habits to the risk of "reaching in" is a well-dramatized pivot that earns the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio is a vivid, contradictory focalizer; his habit of walking backward and his "combative tenderness" create a distinct, embodied presence. The relationship dynamic shifts authentically from guarded hostility to shared resilience, earning the emotional breakthrough in a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s internal conflict—creativity blocked by grief—is clearly established and resolves through action (drawing the fear). However, the emotional arc feels slightly therapeutic and tidy; the "fear to give" is admitted and resolved without deep interpersonal friction or resistance. Soren functions well as a mentor archetype, though his dialogue borders on expository theme-delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency and distinct interiority, with fear ("hands shook") balancing against a sense of duty. The choice to break the ancestral vow is a decisive, character-defining moment that is well-earned by the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lena is drawn with competence and specific traits ("map framer," "methodically curious"), but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her shift from "guarded kindness" to "openness" is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and she faces no significant personal cost for her empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s analytic temperament is well-drawn, providing a distinct filter for the experience. However, Amelia Earhart’s dialogue functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a genuine character voice, breaking immersion with overly perfect aphorisms ("lift is borrowed, holding on is drag") that sound authorial rather than natural to a crash scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio is a compelling protagonist whose desire to remain "seldom heard" creates a distinct, paradoxical motivation that drives the plot. His internal conflict—wanting to be heard without turning his voice into currency—is sophisticated and pays off beautifully in the final choice to remain a "carrier." The empathy for the ghost is grounded in shared traits, making their interaction feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s motivation—wanting to be more than a carrier—is established early and pays off in her decision to sabotage the lift. The "old hurt of being seen and still being small" provides excellent interior grounding for her actions. The transition from servant to savior is earned, though her emotional detachment at the end feels slightly guarded.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict between scientific rigor ("data, not flowers") and the intuitive "childish" method is brilliantly dramatized. The climax integrates these impulses, as she uses a technical tool (telescope) for a poetic purpose, earning the resolution through character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s prosopagnosia is effectively integrated as the functional mechanism for the plot’s resolution, shifting her reliance to tactile patterns to unlock the safe. The internal struggle with her "limit" mirrors the story's thematic climax perfectly, earning the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lio is a functional protagonist for a fable-like narrative, but his primary trait ("diligently curious") is asserted via label rather than demonstrated through difficult choice. The internal landscape is gentle and lacks the contradiction or grit required for higher bands; his isolation is stated but not deeply felt as a pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s specific skillset (locksmithing/filing) actively drives the resolution, transforming a potential theft story into one of creation. The connection between her father's "skipping mind" and the gear provides strong, embodied motivation that raises the stakes beyond a simple fetch quest.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    The collective "we" POV creates distance, flattening individual internal conflict into group consensus. While Mara and Jai have roles, they function as archetypes rather than distinct characters making difficult choices under pressure. The transition from suspicion to trust is summarized rather than dramatized through a high-stakes interpersonal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara is a compelling archetypal figure with a clear, high-stakes motivation. However, the performance lacks the contradictory internal impulses required for higher bands; her sacrifice is noble and linear, missing the psychological friction or hesitation that would deepen the characterization beyond a fable-like martyr role.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between the curse's pain and the duty to travelers is compelling and well-established. The "impression" mechanic serves as a unique, constraint-driven way to interact with the world, grounding the character's agency. The decision to finish the waystones earns a strong resonant reconfiguration at closure. A slight "told" quality regarding the curse tightening—we don't physically feel the penalty escalate in the scene itself—keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and explicit labeling of emotions ("grief she had finally allowed to loosen") rather than dramatized behavior. The "symphonically minded" trait acts as a decorative metaphor overlay rather than a driver of choice or action. While motivation is clear, the internal arc is told to the reader through exposition rather than shown through pressure in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the central action; the internal "hollow" effectively mirrors the external plot problem. The realization of identity is earned through the specific methodological struggle (counting gaps), though the "mindfully scattered" trait serves more as enabling exposition than a source of interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Safi’s unique sensory interaction with the world ("tasting the air") creates a distinct, embodied interiority that drives the narrative. His motivation—to turn pain into craft—is clearly dramatized through the high-stakes choice to unwrap his hands, showing competence balanced with vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("empathetically decisive") rather than demonstrated traits under pressure. While Mara acts, her internal landscape is summarized rather than felt, and she faces no genuine emotional struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Nira’s motivation to reclaim her mind is clear and active, driving the narrative forward. However, her internal struggle is resolved somewhat conveniently through her competence, and the "helix-minded" trait functions more as a label than a source of deep, contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilya is a sharply drawn focalizer whose professional habits ("prism-minded") organically dictate his methodology and survival. The "seeds of vigilance" habit characterizes him deeply while actively driving the plot, though his competence is so high that he faces little internal contradiction or agonizing choice. The decision to speak the codes aloud at the end is a strong, defining character beat that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lysa’s interiority is rich and distinct; her "symphonic mind" translates persuasively into tactile action, grounding the abstract concept of tree-song. The shift from isolation to communal purpose is earned through her sensory engagement, though the specific logistics of her future plan blur the final intent slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sable is a distinct, consistent protagonist whose backstory as an exiled tutor effectively informs his "thoughtfully precise" approach to the crisis. His motivation to find beauty in difficulty is poetic and drives his agency, particularly in the interpretation of the magnetic signs. However, his interaction with Elder Mera is brief and largely reported, limiting the opportunity to see his character tested in a live, interpersonal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lio is defined largely by external quirks ("prayer beads," "soldering apron") and a curated persona rather than deep internal contradiction. The shift from a passive collector to a proactive hero is functional but feels unearned by prior character logic. His "refusal to pry" clashes slightly with his subsequent public reading of the diary, creating a convenient rather than complex morality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jun’s transformation from ambition to service is distinct and earned through the on-page struggle with the bloom's reality. Her specific family custom and sensory traits are not just ornamentation but drive her micro-choices and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s motivation to find the source of resilience is distinct and drives the narrative efficiently toward a clear closure choice. While her agency is evident in the sacrifice of the arrow, the internal leap to trusting the object as a compass feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist displays high agency and professional competence, driving the plot through deduction and physical action. However, the character operates without significant internal contradiction or personal emotional cost beyond the immediate physical danger, leaving the "foresight" motivation feeling slightly functional rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lio’s voice is distinct, but Maera functions largely as a plot device; her sudden shift from serenity to panic feels mechanically timed to force the climax. Her expository confession ("confessed she carved...") flattens motivation into told dialogue rather than dramatized subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora is a strongly motivated protagonist whose internal conflict—adhering to code versus seeking redemption—drives the narrative. Her choice to uncase the flute is a clear, character-defining action that breaks her own rules to achieve her goal. The encounter with the pilgrim, however, feels slightly less earned as a character beat because he functions more as a gentle guide than a source of dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kestrel is a distinct, high-concept protagonist, but her "habit of borrowing personalities" is largely summarized rather than dramatized until the stranger's arrival. The internal cost of "coherence loss" is stated effectively but relies on exposition more than embodied struggle in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rook's specific internal state (jittery, keeping boots on) is established early, but his agency falters in the middle beat where the pendant, not his action, solves the lamplighter's disconnection. He reclaims agency at the closure by writing the question, but the characterization feels slightly passive during the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the narrative arc; the narrator's shift from demanding facts to accepting emotional truth is earned. The choice to enact a "truthful lie" reveals deep empathy and agency, resolving the internal conflict with visible cost. Lio serves as a catalyst but remains grounded in specific, embodied details (clay boots, attention) that prevent him from becoming a mere plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Yara serves effectively as a fable archetype, and her choice to sacrifice her voice is poignant. However, the narrative relies heavily on summary ("Night after night") rather than dramatized scenes, which distances the reader from her interior struggle and makes the realization of the cost feel observed rather than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s arc is conceptually strong, with the cost of his sacrifice visibly paid in the final "empty eyed" image. However, internal shifts are often summarized or labeled ("Anger tried to rise") rather than embodied in the moment, creating a distance that muffles the emotional impact of the memory loss.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's sudden ability to navigate the "spontaneous" cycles at the climax contradicts the established inability to schedule them. Jalen functions primarily as a thematic mouthpiece rather than a realized character, delivering the story's thesis in unnatural dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Noah’s internal drive to "bottle safety" provides a strong emotional spine, and his "warmly observant" nature is well-dramatized in his interactions with Maris. However, his professional competence strains credibility when he prioritizes building rock stacks over immediately fixing a critical navigation light during a crisis, creating a disconnect between his character traits and his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "storm herald" persona is vivid and the interplay between accidental prophecy and intentional guidance drives the narrative effectively. However, the protagonist's interiority occasionally drifts into stylized abstraction ("chill of accident," "shadowed elation") rather than grounded emotion. The interaction with the mayor feels summary-heavy, distancing the reader from the relational cost of the protagonist's dangerous gift.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maru’s internal conflict—between the dye master’s habit of control and the donor’s legacy of letting go—is articulate and moving. The shift from wanting to "chase light" to becoming the illuminator is earned through the narrative arc. Motivation is clear, though the emotional resistance during the middle quest phase is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation—a "private hunger" to understand the witness of trees—is distinct and drives the narrative arc effectively. While agency is high, the emotional interiority feels slightly distant during the climax; the "arithmetic of sadness" is a beautiful concept, but the personal stakes of subverting the system are intellectualized rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lysa functions well as a mythic archetype with a clear internal wound (gift vs. loss), but the specific mechanism of her sacrifice wavers when the realm conveniently refunds her memories mid-climax. Her final choice to remain fragmented feels like a valid stance, but the emotional cost is softened by the prior magical windfall. The characterization relies more on role than psychological specificity, fitting the fable mode.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin is a coherent archetype of the "wise mentor," but his characterization lacks dynamic internal friction; his transition from recluse to guide is instantaneous and frictionless. The backstory of his sister's death provides thematic background but does not exert active psychological pressure or complicate his choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mina’s transition from a passive "noticer" to an active participant is elevated by the confession of her signed complaint, which adds essential moral complexity and culpability. The internal conflict is embodied, and the "creeping normality" trait drives her choices organically rather than just serving as a label.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ilian is a superbly realized protagonist whose gentle meticulousness is tested by the crisis. The interplay between his professional detachment and the personal grief for his sister creates a genuine internal conflict, resolved by the active choice to offer his own promise as a stabilizing force. The cost is felt in the final image, where his ledger transforms from a shield into a mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a distinct, proactive protagonist with clear motivation and agency. Her steadfastness is well-dramatized through her patience and method, and the final choice to violate the truce creates visible cost. The internal landscape ("less like bravery and more like habit") adds specific, character-bound depth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's interiority is rich, grounding the "luminous skeptic" persona in specific physical traits and memories. The shift from skepticism to participation is earned through the grandmother's legacy, though the moment of decision ("I should have refused") passes relatively quickly. The integration of the physical "glow" as both a state mark and a tool for "keeping the convergence honest" is excellent character work.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara is a distinct focalizer with a clear internal drive, but the pivotal action—hiding a mechanical shim behind a painting in a deserted cave—muddies her agency with unclear motivation. The logic of her choice feels performative rather than practical, weakening the sense of competence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s profession and her "demand for candor" establish a strong internal conflict, though the fern occasionally acts as an emotional prosthetic, externalizing reactions that could be more deeply embodied. Her final decision to offer vulnerability rather than accusation is a well-earned decisive change that validates her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lysa functions well as a fable archetype, and her desire to preserve "wonder" is grounded in her kinetic construction. However, her antagonist (the Auditor) is a two-dimensional straw man who capitulates immediately upon touching the ice, lacking the sustained pressure or complexity required for higher bands. The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("bleaching of wonder") rather than dramatized, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    N-3 is a triumph of specific embodiment; the "grandmother with metal joints" persona creates a precise filter for the crisis. His choice to incinerate the relics he cherishes to save his charges demonstrates profound agency and establishes a felt cost that defines his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara functions primarily as a narrative device to unlock the mystery rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict. Her primary choice—to investigate rather than sell the locket—is stated rather than dramatized with felt cost, and her "training to notice what others miss" feels like a convenient tag. The lack of contradictory impulses makes her agency feel procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra is a competent, stylized protagonist whose specific skills (dance-coding) drive the plot, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful flaws. The motivation ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, resulting in a character who feels more like a thematic vehicle than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lysa’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss, driving her agency from the coffee reading to the excavation. The emotional arc is compelling, though the interaction with the foreman relies on a slightly convenient role-based permission rather than active maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora is a highly capable protagonist whose internal conflict—suppressing chaos versus allowing a necessary warning—drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct; rather than reacting passively to the prophecy, she actively modifies her tactics (hush to filter) to solve the dilemma. The resolution earns its weight by shifting her burden from a magical secret-keeper to a public truth-teller, a clear and costly evolution of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation to save their home is grounded and urgent, and the relationship with Ilyas is drawn with poignant, specific detail ("patient as lichen"). The dynamic of the living learning from the dead anchors the narrative emotionally. However, the protagonist's internal struggle is relatively light; the decision to falsify the inspector's notes is made without significant hesitation or moral wrestling, slightly flattening the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is clearly drawn with a distinct worldview ("charmed skeptic"), and her agency drives the resolution. However, her internal monologue relies heavily on abstract labeling ("translate isolation into independence") rather than embodied struggle, and the emotional shift at the end feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s characterization is anchored by a specific, professional motivation—to "forgive the unfinished"—that drives her refusal to sign the confession. Her internal conflict between safety (signing) and truth (completing the sentence) is dramatized effectively through the lens of her craft. The resolution, where she weaponizes her forgery skills to expose the truth, feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is a competent protagonist with a clear motivation, but the summary-heavy narration creates distance, limiting access to her immediate interiority during the rising action. While her final choice to join the shells is resonant, the lack of micro-choices during the journey makes her feel more like a mythic figure than a character under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("salvage something pure") but lacks dramatization through difficult choices in a live scene. The reliance on summary denies the protagonist the chance to demonstrate interior depth or struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Ren’s arc from insecurity to competence is functional but relies on a rapid, unearned transition without dramatized failure or resistance. Jiro operates as a static archetypal mentor, lacking the internal contradiction or specific interiority required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and the voice is consistent, but the narrative relies heavily on summary during the climax. This prevents the dramatization of contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure, leaving the character feeling more like a procedural function than a conflicted individual.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eli is distinct, but his pivot from rivalry to collaboration lacks friction or visible cost; the "variant allegiance" is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. The internal conflict resolves too conveniently upon Mara's arrival, turning potential drama into a smooth procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sato functions well as a fable archetype, but his internal landscape is largely summarized ("he told himself," "he believed") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His altruism comes without hesitation or significant personal cost, making him feel idealized rather than humanly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lio is a distinct, highly competent protagonist whose internal duality ("logically emotional") drives the resolution. His choice to act as a confessor rather than a combatant is earned by his established background, and he facilitates a profound emotional shift in the antagonist without breaking character. The "cost" is subtle—the burden of witnessing—but effective for this fable-like scope.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    The character is defined entirely by diagnostic labels ("vigilant," "softly purposeful," "fault in her blood") rather than dramatized behavior. The pivotal moment of internal conflict ("impatience surged... yet she remembered her vow") is summarized rather than inhabited, lacking the visceral texture of a specific micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a distinct, competent professional whose internal conflict (compliance vs. truth) drives the narrative. Her motivation is clear, though the "entangled memories" serve as a shortcut to deepen her stakes rather than purely organic character development. The connection between her father’s death and the historical trauma feels summarized, but her final choice to risk her career is well-earned by the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is sophisticated; Elias's doubt acting like a "fracture that predicts weather" provides distinct, embodied interiority. The mirroring of mannerisms ("aptly deliberate") between the chaplain and the inmate effectively dramatizes their shared burden without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose curiosity effectively drives the plot, but her internal landscape lacks friction; she navigates the danger with a laugh rather than genuine struggle. While her actions are motivated, the emotional cost of her journey is low, as the "yearning" remains an external algorithm she follows rather than a deeply felt deficit that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a sharply drawn protagonist whose professional competence conflicts beautifully with her personal loss. Her motivation (finding her mother) justifies the escalation from passive observer to active subversive, earning the final risky choice. The interiority is specific and grounded, avoiding melodrama while conveying deep grief.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    Mara functions as a device to deliver the solution rather than a character undergoing genuine struggle; her traits are established via diagnostic labels ("calmly intuitive") rather than action. The realization of the "courageous anomaly" feels abstract and cerebral, lacking the visceral friction or internal cost required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator's interiority is distinct and consistent, effectively grounding the surreal concept of "euthanasia tourism" in a specific emotional reality. The voice is dense and evocative ("skull had lost its latch"), though the "fold in patience" trait feels slightly more told than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's internal landscape is rich, blending occupational details with emotional metaphor effectively. However, the connection with Mara relies on a convenient "mirroring" (both holding burned letters) that feels engineered rather than organic, and their voices converge during the philosophical exchange, lacking distinct idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary; Iri's specific skill (peripheral awareness) integrates perfectly with her worldview and choices. The Prophet is complex, balancing charisma with a genuine fear of his own power ("rot into command"), creating a dynamic duality. Their interaction drives the narrative arc through a shared, earned vulnerability rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions as an archetypal catalyst rather than a fully realized protagonist; she lacks internal contradiction or personal risk. Her "secret motivation" is stated directly rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her consistent calmness offers no friction against the narrative's events.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s evolution from a scholar of the margins to a defender of the "rot" is compelling and earned through dramatized observation. The internal conflict—anger softening into responsibility—is resolved with a distinct shift in stance that feels authentic to the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orrin is a compelling creation; his &quot;precognitively forgetful&quot; nature creates a distinct, paradoxical internal life that drives the plot mechanics. Mira is motivated clearly by the fear of her mother&#039;s silence, though her emotional arc is conveyed largely through exposition (&quot;confessed she had begun clinging&quot;) rather than dramatized vulnerability in the early beats. The dynamic of him leading while she &quot;anchors&quot; him is a strong, reciprocal relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose interiority—grounded in the "repairer" mindset—shapes her worldview and problem-solving. Her motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is clearly dramatized through the action, and the backstory of her father and Lio anchors her competence in specific emotional history without stalling the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara serves as a highly competent facilitator, but her role borders on the "magical helper" archetype with little internal friction or personal cost. While her "decisively kind" attribute drives the plot, she functions more as a plot device than a character under pressure; the emotional weight is entirely displaced onto the secondary cast.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora is a focused, competent protagonist whose trait of "quiet deliberation" directly opposes the antagonist force (haste/broken reality), grounding her agency. While her internal conflict is subtle rather than deeply torn, her choices drive every beat of the investigation. The "budding" scholar aspect adds a layer of earned competence, though a moment of sharper personal doubt could have deepened the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rowan is a compelling protagonist whose specific professional expertise (bone setting) drives his interaction with the supernatural. The shift from skepticism to responsibility is earned through tactile, character-specific action (setting the jaw) rather than abstract thought. His internal state is complex, balancing grief with a clinical eye.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lio’s interior landscape of guilt is rendered with specific, embodied detail that grounds his motivation effectively. However, the transition from trauma to healing feels frictionless; the resolution is achieved through solitary labor without a sharp on-page interpersonal test or difficult trade-off to earn the redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's shift from pariah to active agent is compelling, anchored by the high-stakes sacrifice of the pendant. Interiority is strong, though lines like "shame kept reopening the old scar" lean into diagnostic telling rather than fully embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s internal conflict—commercial "bright endings" versus honest courage—is clear and drives the narrative arc. Her transformation from architect to witness is earned through action, though the specific trait "lucidly watchful" feels slightly inserted as a prompt requirement rather than an organic character flaw or strength.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marn functions effectively as a fable archetype, and his shift from mechanical isolation to communal leadership is clear. However, his interiority is minimal, and the realization that "practices are not machines" arrives as a narrator assertion rather than a dramatized internal struggle. The lack of genuine doubt or high-stakes personal cost limits the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eira is a distinct, stylized presence who fits the fable-like tone, but her motivation ("translate heartbeats into maps") feels more like a thematic conceit than a grounded psychological drive. While her ritual actions are clear, the "trust not numbers" trait reads as a slightly clichéd setup for the story's central dichotomy.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ivo is a distinct focalizer with a consistent worldview ("listened to what metal remembered"), but the narrative lacks the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. His motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through a struggle between opposing values, making his journey feel smooth and inevitable rather than earned through a difficult character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s professional competence is distinct and grounding, balancing the fable-like tone with concrete labor. The internal burden ("fear of empty hands") adds necessary dimension, though its late reveal feels slightly more expository than dramatized in the early beats. The widow's inclusion effectively grounds the magical transaction in human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    Miriam's characterization is exemplary; her "hauntingly practical" nature is not just labeled but dramatized through the inventorying of sorrow and the carving process. The internal arc from the "pacing silence" of grief to a "rust hued peace" is earned through specific, embodied action rather than abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal trajectory from ambitious savior to resolute tender of small repairs is executed with precision. The central choice—trading her cherished "developed images" (ambition/hope) for a single functional bolt—demonstrates a profound, character-specific cost. The ghost serves effectively as an externalized crucible for this internal conflict, forcing a renunciation that feels earned rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina is a competent, active protagonist whose "functional creativity" drives the plot, satisfying the agency requirement. However, her internal landscape is mostly metaphorical; she lacks deep contradictory impulses or genuine emotional risk, making the "stoicism" feel like a label rather than a lived trait.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear agency by tearing the ledger to help the bear, earning the internal shift. However, interiority relies partly on diagnostic labels ("introverted fit me better," "silence... was a wound"), which distances the reader from the embodied experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but she functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character. The internal state described as "serene upheaval" feels like a told label rather than embodied emotion. Her success relies heavily on convenient skills that remove the need for difficult choices or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lio functions as a consistent archetype but lacks the internal contradiction or doubt required for depth; he succeeds without paying a personal cost or navigating a difficult choice beyond patience.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal motivation ("geography of healing") is perfectly dramatized through the shared vulnerability of the projection ritual ("permitted only because we both needed it"). The Queen's transition from resisting rumor to accepting the "map" is earned through specific, embodied interaction rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lorian is a distinct, embodied protagonist whose internal "uncalibrated spring" of desire perfectly matches the external conflict. His "habit of hypothesizing" serves as a character-specific tool that drives the plot's resolution rather than just a quirk. The final choice to leave the Cradle unguarded is a potent moment of character definition, prioritizing raw beauty over safety.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist relies on superhero-level competence (performing a skin graft in a burning building) that defies professional reality and breaks character grounding. Interiority is dominated by thematic self-analysis ("practiced unyielding compassion") rather than organic, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s definition as a "luminous skeptic" is effectively dramatized through the constellation puzzle, but the backstory regarding her mother appears as a convenient revelation rather than an earned discovery, flattening the emotional complexity. The protagonist's agency is strong, but the internal conflict resolves somewhat rapidly through the application of the thematic trait.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior is a beautifully realized protagonist whose "otherworldly sentimentalist" trait is not just a label but the engine of his choices. His internal conflict—fear of repeating his parents' extremes (furnace vs. silence)—drives every beat, culminating in a resolution that synthesizes a new path. The emotional arc is distinct, embodied, and deeply felt without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary labels ("thoughtful," "fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized behavior or micro-choices. The protagonist undergoes no visible internal struggle or resistance; his emotional state is explained to the reader rather than shown through reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s characterization is anchored in a compelling blend of professional precision and personal guilt. Her motivation—"incremental absolution"—is psychologically distinct and drives the narrative logic from the first sentence to the final confession. The internal conflict regarding her hesitation during the storm adds profound texture to her diligence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's specific capability to decode complex tapestry ciphers appears conveniently without setup, breaking believability ("competence convenience"). The "blithe" trait is explicitly stated but contradicted by the somber, heavy narrative voice, creating a "tell vs. show" dissonance that flattens the character.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Jora is a compelling protagonist whose specific expertise ("ignorance cartographer") drives the narrative logic and resolution. The backstory of her father effectively grounds her motivation, though her internal emotional struggle is somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally felt in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions as a plot vehicle rather than a realized character; her transition from obedient copyist to revolutionary occurs via summary ("she promised herself," "Mara decided") rather than through a dramatized struggle with conflicting impulses. Her motivation is stated explicitly rather than emerging from a complex internal state, leaving her emotional arc feeling linear and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is deep and precise; Lira’s motivation ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") is beautifully dramatized through her specific trade. Her internal conflict regarding the "mirage of safety" adds stakes to every action, and her composure under pressure reveals a hardened, competent pro. The connection between her father's death and her current vocation is moving and earns the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orin’s motivation is clearly dramatized through the conflict between comfort (meal ticket) and principle (the cog). The "wannabe" nuance adds depth to his agency, and the refusal of Mara's offer demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The internal struggle is grounded in the physical action of digging.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but the ensemble cast relies on stock shorthand (the miner, the sisters) rather than individuation. The resolution is driven by the council’s sudden, convenient change of heart rather than a costly choice Mara makes in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a distinct, mythic protagonist whose specific ability (tasting memories) drives the plot, but she lacks internal friction or doubt. Her competence is absolute—she knows exactly how to plant, prune, and feed the seed—which reduces the emotional cost of her choices to stated feelings rather than dramatized struggle. The attribute "informally wise" is delivered as a label and a posture rather than emerging from a difficult, high-stakes dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maro’s involuntary candor serves as a compelling engine for the plot, but Sela’s characterization suffers from functional convenience. Her rapid pivot from expecting a bribe to confessing a career-ending crime lacks sufficient resistance or earned motivation, reducing her to a plot device rather than a distinct agent. While Maro’s internal desire for wonder is well-established, the interpersonal friction dissolves too easily to test him deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara serves primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a deeply embodied character; her motivation to understand "aliveness" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. While her internal logic is consistent, the lack of significant interpersonal friction or high-stakes trade-offs leaves her development feeling somewhat abstract. The "creeping normality" trait functions more as a label than a driver of difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's shift from righteous certainty to complicit guilt is impactful and earned by the sequence of revelations. The Founder's "incisively kind" persona creates a distinct, high-pressure dynamic that forces this evolution without resorting to simple exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator’s identity as a "grim optimist" is masterfully dramatized through the specific action of using numbers to pick the locks of a surreal reality. The internal arc—from frantically trying to solve the staircase to accepting the "texture of the missed opportunity"—is profound and earned via the on-page failure of his proofs. The protagonist’s voice is distinct, blending mathematical precision with deep, embodied regret. The choice to stop imagining a better landing is a potent, character-defining renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira is a strongly defined protagonist with concrete interiority and a "methodically hopeful" worldview that drives the narrative. However, Ro functions largely as a plot device to validate her thesis rather than as a fully realized agent with competing friction. The relationship dynamic relies on an archetype of shared trauma rather than a dramatic negotiation of trust in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maris is a distinct, evocative protagonist whose role as a curator/baker drives the narrative logic. However, she lacks internal contradiction or grit; her choices are uniformly noble, and she faces no significant internal opposition or difficult trade-off, resulting in a slightly idealized "helper" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character motivation is sharp and the internal arc toward acceptance is clear. The climax relies heavily on an intellectual realization ("fate's true lock was not time but his need to force it") rather than a visceral struggle, which slightly distances the emotional cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal state ("drowning fear") is palpable, and the motivation is distinct. However, agency is somewhat diluted as the character relies heavily on the "whispering advisor" and the dictionary's instructions to navigate the plot, rather than deriving tactics solely from their own ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leeward is a compelling focalizer whose "habit" of sketching sound provides a distinct, grounded interiority that drives the plot. While the crew’s compliance is convenient, their physical synchronization via rhythm effectively establishes Leeward's leadership without needing dialogue. He lacks deep internal conflict or vulnerability, reading as a highly competent archetype, but his agency in translating disaster into music is absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is a competent, proactive protagonist whose skills as a cartographer drive the plot. While her internal conflict is somewhat muted—her "quiet drive" overrides fear with little hesitation—her agency is high, and her actions consistently advance the narrative. The realization at the gate allows for a moment of genuine dread that grounds her character.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her "emotionally rational" trait drives the compromise, but the reliance on summarized interaction rather than dramatized dialogue creates a barrier to embodied emotion. Hadrin functions well as a foil, but the lack of direct exchange leaves their dynamic feeling slightly theoretical rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s motivation is well-dramatized through the specific action of underwater repair, though the "interlaced absence" interiority relies on diagnostic labeling. The choice to physically engage Beran rather than flee earns the stakes, grounding her sensitivity in grit.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose professional skills act as the primary lens for the narrative. Her internal motivation ("reclaimed stillness") aligns well with the external crisis, though the emotional landscape is somewhat cool and functional. The moment of "dappled resolve" feels slightly labeled rather than embodied, but her agency in the investigation is clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and poetic, but her internal struggle is handled through summary rather than dramatized hesitation. The choice to split herself feels inevitable rather than weighed, reducing the felt cost of the sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is viscerally grounded in the trauma of the wedding strike, transforming a victim narrative into active agency. The "unfiltered awakening" effectively serves as both a neurological condition and a moral stance, driving the hunt for the "pause" in the algorithm. The final choice to weaponize mercy is a profound character beat that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose interiority (“familiar itch of missing pieces”) aligns well with the fable-like tone. Her drone-piloting skills are integrated naturally into the problem-solving, though the "perpetually surprised" trait functions more as a recurring descriptive tag than a constraint that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict—professional deception versus shared personal grief—is viscerally embodied in the watch hand she carries. Her final choice to dismantle her own safety ("afraid of blame") for Jonah's sake is a high-cost decision earned by the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena is a compelling, highly competent focalizer whose internal landscape ("listening past insults") seamlessly drives the plot. Her backstory regarding her father is efficiently integrated to motivate her behavior in the present crisis, giving weight to the climax. The choice to sacrifice her personal token creates a visible, felt cost that earns the resolution. A slight reliance on hyper-competence prevents a perfect score, but the execution is authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theo’s internal conflict—fear of open water versus the need for atonement—is well-dramatized through action. The &quot;merrily melancholic&quot; trait feels like a labeled insertion rather than a naturally emerging behavior, but the underlying psychology of navigating by safety proxies (poles) is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's shift from "blank heart" to seeking redemption is driven by a "belief in schemes," which bridges the gap competently, though the initial impulse to follow the stranger feels slightly convenient given the premise of emotional erasure. The pivotal choice to save the thief effectively dramatizes the return of empathy, grounding the internal arc in action rather than just the summary that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is visceral and drives the ritual effectively. The pivot where she accepts the loss of her humanity ("tired of graves") feels slightly rushed; a moment of sharper hesitation or internal cost weighing the "duties" she abandons would deepen the psychological realism of the metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's desperation and agency drive the narrative, culminating in a choice that carries deep emotional cost (reliving the trauma to regain the time). The internal conflict between the desire for sleep and the need for connection is dramatized with visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and her gravitational response to emotion is a brilliant, specific trait that drives the climax. However, the pivot from lifelong guilt to "clean happiness" during the confrontation with Lio feels slightly compressed, resolving complex trauma with a single exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    Amina functions more as a thematic vessel than a fully realized character, with the "hush" acting as a proxy for her agency during pivotal moments. Her motivation is abstract and philosophical ("texture of transformation"), and her lack of internal conflict or doubt makes her competence feel unearned and the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator is distinct and capable, with a voice that matches the "calmly inventive" prompt perfectly. However, the lack of genuine internal conflict or struggle against the antagonist (Orven) creates a "competence porn" dynamic where success feels inevitable rather than earned. The emotional cost is low, as the protagonist operates with a "private laugh" rather than felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eren's grief and physical struggle are grounded well in the unique premise, establishing strong motivation. However, his pivotal transformation relies on an external validation (the message in the rocks) rather than an earned internal shift, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, but the emotional pivot regarding the father relies on summary ("my anger and gratitude mixed") rather than dramatized struggle. The attribute "furiously tranquil" is applied as a static label to Lysa rather than demonstrated through behavior, and the internal shift feels resolved too conveniently by the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander is a distinct, competent protagonist whose "diplomatically fierce" trait effectively drives the action and resolution. However, the lack of genuine vulnerability or internal cost limits depth; the antagonist is a one-dimensional foil who poses little threat, reducing the conflict's emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by poetic labels ("impatient personality of May") rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The characterization relies on summary and "told" internal states rather than embodied behavior in a specific scene. The "molting personalities" trait feels ornamental, describing mood rather than constraining tactics or dialogue in real-time interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lio’s internal conflict (stasis vs. movement) is perfectly embodied in the external plot, driving causality without hesitation. His contradictory impulses—carrying the broken clock while playing for departures—create a rich, specific interiority that earns the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tavo is a distinct protagonist whose internal conflict—empiricism versus the necessity of surrender—drives the narrative. His transition from skeptic to participant is earned, with the loss of his "certainty" providing a legible cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's motivation—to articulate an apology to a specific shade—is compelling and distinct. The pivot from external blame to internal realization ("began with my own silence") is well-earned by the ritualistic pressure, though the emotional resolution feels slightly smoother than the messy reality of grief usually permits.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is precise, scientist-cold yet porous to wonder; the contradiction between “preprocess reality” and letting irregularities stand is dramatized in her micro-choice to keep the noisy dust maps. The final renunciation of telescope nights is felt, not declared, and the shared patch-job with Lupe shows relational shift with cost. Only the one-line “grief redistributed” flirts with label-speak, but it is instantly grounded in the dust overlay. Character arc is complete, specific, and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass artist’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific—“coaxes light into bottles until it hums”—and her decision to forge proof in glass is earned. Yet the moment she deciphers the smeared ledger line happens off-stage in silent realization, so the decisive micro-choice is only summarized, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orren’s survivor guilt and bone-level rhythm memory drive every micro-choice; the empty tuning-fork slot externalizes his need and charges the final gesture. Mara’s silent authority and quick penciled strokes create a crisp status crucible that forces Orren to risk his only relic. The child’s flinch and recovery supply a visible cost loop that proves the system works and completes his arc. Interiority stays embodied—heat on skin, tremor in bench—never sliding into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marek’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is dramatized in every beat—he keeps walking, bleeds into his helmet, trades his own breath to wedge the lens—so the final endurance costs his body and future. The interiority stays concrete (“the road still holds footsteps”) and avoids label-speak; contradictory impulses (throw the lens back / keep it) coexist in-scene. One micro-choice—sealing the receiver with wax from the books—crystallizes his hierarchy of values: archive before self. The earned stasis (he surfaces cracked but having given the dead an address) forecloses any return to anonymity, price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amira’s gently-persistent bell-ringing and anonymous-fund tactics are shown through embodied micro-choices (hiding routes, counting coins by touch), but the interior contradiction between fear and hope stays summary-level; no moment lets us feel both impulses collide inside her body. The final daylight ring is earned, yet the cost is collective, not personally internalized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the unspoken vs. releasing it—are dramatized in embodied breathwork under live pressure; the final renunciation is earned by the prior camera-vision causality and costs her the ember-knot she had hoarded, visible in the sternum release.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    The designer’s desire to “discover the texture of time” is concrete and embodied in every pruning cut and compass turn; the final renunciation—pressing the halo into the soil—pays the cost of that desire. Interiority stays specific (“gentle vertigo that shook my teeth”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is the woman’s expository monologue at the maze center, which momentarily flattens the contradictory impulses that had driven him.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s chained wrist and patient strategy are shown through embodied choices—using the chain as tool, letting a child feel its weight—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction is light; she never doubts the seed mission, so the arc is steady rather than fracturing. The final grace-note with the farmers lands as earned endurance, cost visible in her trembling wrist, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost fully; a hair more self-interrogation would tip it over.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s synesthetic ear and grief-forged mission are vivid; the moment she slips the aid into her pocket she crystallizes a costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete, but the brother’s death is recounted more than re-lived, muting the emotional bruise that could have pushed this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s contradictory drives— to possess the perfect image vs. to release the subject— are dramatized in the final tearing of the print; the cost (losing his “craft” trophy and the girl’s possible vanishing) is felt. Interiority stays concrete through sensory theft metaphors, though occasional lyric shorthand (“luminous disbelief”) edges toward label. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: hoarding moonbeam-washed photos < returning the sunset half < saving her. Relationship pressure is light because the stranger’s interior is withheld, but status shift— subject becoming co-agent— satisfies short-form crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s guilt-riven return and the micro-choice to embed the cracked bookmark into every glass panel embody contradictory impulses (shame vs. reparative making) under rising pressure; the final quiet renunciation of narration shows earned change with visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interiority stays concrete, tied to kiln heat and glass viscosity; no diagnostic self-talk. The only bar to 9.0: we never see her interact with a second present character, so status crucible and voice distinction bullets are N/A rather than executed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s fear-as-compass and adaptive hiding are dramatized in embodied beats (shaking masked on roofs, charcoal rubbing on cast). The final choice to broadcast trembling instead of suppressing it credibly reverses her survival strategy with visible cost—signing her real name while still holding the child’s hand. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. The boy’s pain could be filtered more through her body rather than reported, but the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartographer’s “mildly obsessed hunger” is embodied in trembling hands and the theft of the booklet; the final renunciation—mapping silence instead of stars—pays off that trait with visible cost as the gold washes away. Lyr functions less as a full second character than as a prophetic mirror, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is thin; her choices don’t bend the protagonist’s arc, only authorize it. Interior contradiction is strong: the need to measure vs. the dawning knowledge that measurement is futile plays out in micro-choices (closing the booklet, tracing the spiral). Still, the oracle’s stakes remain opaque, muting the relational torque that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    J-17’s composed trait and private quest are cleanly dramatized through micro-choices—aligning bristles, lifting the violin, choosing to stop looping—each revealing a hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction between programmed tidiness and emergent curiosity is felt, not told. Yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relational pressure off the table, capping depth. Still, the renunciation of further loops carries visible cost (the violin’s crack, the final note) and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—fear of exposure vs. need to protect Eli—play out in concrete micro-choices (hiding the lens, copying doodles, finally signing her name). The final gesture of transparency costs her institutional safety and is fully earned. Interiority stays embodied and specific; no diagnostic self-labeling. One hairline slip: “secrecy manufactures suspicion” is a touch abstract for peak beat, but immediately grounded by the lens-offering action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quietly stubborn stewardship and his need to reconcile an old lie with living plants are rendered through tactile ritual (marble-polishing, midnight cuttings). Interiority stays grounded in sensory work; the final admission to the hedges crystallizes a believable, earned shift. The only drag is a touch of self-explanatory phrasing (“he learned that some false fronts…”) that slightly blunts the contradiction in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s obliging nature is shown through embodied action—tightening gloves, levering the nexus—rather than label. The internal contradiction between curiosity and custodial caution is dramatized in the split-second she chooses repair over data, paying the cost of letting Sen keep the secret. The gliders’ synchronized sigh externalizes her micro-choice, cementing earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her fear and wonder are embodied in the lantern tremor and ankle-deep stance—but the causal chain from “inspired by silence” to risking a night alone in a drowned theater is asserted rather than dramatized; the moment she bows to an empty room lands as ritual gesture, not visible cost, so the final endurance feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt is embodied in the fevered synesthesia of wind-in-ribs; the lie about the wind speed is a concrete micro-choice that keeps reverberating. Mara’s “fault-tolerant” stance is shown, not labeled, when she smudges the notebook to make room for unspoken error. The final confession to Eli is credibly awkward—shoulders stay stiff—so the emotional cost lands. Minor slip: “swallowed truth” is repeated so often it starts to feel diagnostic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s skeptical-mill-explorer identity is vividly embodied in sensory beats (grease-beaded wheel, radio psychics) and drives every micro-choice; the final refusal to carry Mara’s silence is earned through the ghost-shift ordeal. Interior contradiction—drowsy yet alert, rational yet compelled—remains active in-scene. Only the absence of on-page Mara limits full relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s vow of non-interference is stated, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse is tested in-scene, so the renunciation at the obsidian refuge feels pre-decided. The only micro-choice—tracing the swan—repeats without escalating cost. Interiority is atmospheric but generic; “grief into usable soil” is summary, not embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s cautious-exuberant contradiction is embodied in micro-choices (lowering kalimba volume, opening palm) that cost her emotional exposure; Mara's silence-to-hum shift is credibly incremental. The locket as proxy for dead brother tilts every therapeutic decision, so the final whistle exchange feels earned rather than miraculous. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—even at the eclipse crest. What keeps it from 9+ is the single-scene limit: we glimpse but don’t fully feel the prior weeks of failed attempts, so the stakes leap rather than compound.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s perceptual sensitivity is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—chipping mortar, pinning the tapestry—so her historian’s mission feels embodied. The final renunciation (“no one could set it back”) is earned by the concrete cataloguing ritual and carries visible cost in the bronze-quiet pinning. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. She is the only on-page agent, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; her flaw—accepting irreparability—drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lian’s shift from passive predictor to active arranger is embodied in the micro-choice of pushing the courier into the cleft; the contradiction between prophecy and agency is kept alive in scene, not explained. Interiority stays concrete—ink smell, salt burn, beam rhythm—never sliding into label-speak. The final renunciation of coded fortunes costs her the safety of anonymity; the price is legible in the blank paper she burns. Voice remains singular, no head-hop, and status with Mara is legible in gesture, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s micro-choices—matching breath to anaphora, drawing the circle—embody contradictory impulses (surrender vs. self-assertion) and pay the cost of a shivering body; Selo’s priestly restraint is equally specific. Interiority stays concrete: “quiet had been picked apart thread by thread.” The final renunciation is earned because the memory of mapping-as-search (not conquest) is dramatized, not told. Only the absence of Selo’s own flaw keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “chronological homesickness” is embodied in tactile rituals—saving paper, mapping memories on glass, pressing shell to ear—so the interior contradiction is lived, not labeled. The final renunciation of clawing at the past is earned because every micro-choice (folding the new fortune, conducting silence) has rehearsed letting go. The only bar to 9 is that the station tourists remain off-page, so no relationship crucible tests the shift; the arc is solitary but complete.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysa’s fear-of-commitment flaw is embodied in her gravity-defying drift; the tablet confrontation forces her to stay in one timeline, paying the cost of heavier emotional weight. Interiority is concrete (“floated away from love to avoid being pulled down”), not label-speak. The final micro-choice—pressing the tablet to her chest and choosing gravity—earns the change; causality holds. One slip: the younger-self apparition is more mirror than crucible, so the relationship-as-pressure bullet is only weakly met.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s embodied deafness, her cane-time literacy, and her classroom numbness are concrete; the decision to “score the record while it reverses” crystallizes her hierarchy of values (children’s feeling > her own safety). The Listener scene supplies external pressure, but the internal contradiction—she destroys the parasite by intensifying the very silence she fears—lands with visible cost: the snapped filament dusts her palm and the cavern’s hush becomes breathable again. One hairline slip: “emotional numbness she could not name” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, though it’s immediately re-anchored in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s storm-recorder meticulousness is dramatized in every beat—note-taking under surveillance, reading wind off roofs—so when he chooses lateral flight over direct confrontation the decision is trait-rooted and costly (Mara’s raw wrists, his own hunted future). Interiority stays concrete: “my stomach measured it as fraud.” The final note-book promise shows earned endurance, not epiphany, with solitude now elected, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s aromatic caution, debt guilt, and need to keep the vial closed are dramatized through breath-control and trembling hands; the final uncorking is earned by the revealed filial link and costs him his broker identity. Interiority stays concrete—“his tears were not weakness but memory insisting on being felt” avoids label-speak. One micro-choice—letting “one measured breath” escape—crystallizes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s desire to “feel time” is embodied through tactile rope-work and ethical gambits; the slip-knot compromise shows contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority stays concrete, never abstracting into “I felt” labels. The final refusal to open the knot forever crystallizes a cost the prior beats have primed. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s hyper-acute hearing is embodied in every beat (the pin-in-pocket image, the “private thunder” of her own steps) and drives her decision to seek the knot; the final laugh shows earned change. Interior contradiction is present—gift as burden—yet the father’s aphorism is repeated rather than tested in scene, so the internal shift feels slightly inherited, not battled for. Jory remains a courteous cipher; no status tension or micro-choice from him pressures Mara, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her micro-choices (bowing so softly the note is “almost imagined,” pressing bowl to cistern) visibly trace the arc with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s practiced detachment cracks only once—when she channels her own shame into the petal—making the final choice feel earned. The micro-choice to inscribe Orin’s brother’s name on the case lid crystallizes her cost. Interiority stays concrete (“static made truth loud”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the phrase “absurdly for a woman who sold fakes” edges toward self-diagnosis under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s shrewd kindness is embodied through the locket reveal and her brokerage-funded envelopes; the contradictory mix of caution and exuberance is shown, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete (“felt cautious exuberance become steadier joy”). The final stance—accepting the looped mis-address as engine—earns its cost: she bankrolls an open-ended chain. Minor: the mother-backstory is a single beat, not a flaw, but keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sava’s ache of being “unclaimed” and her offer to trade labor for kin-knowledge give every beat purpose; the moment she presses reeds into obsidian shows embodied contradiction—she risks permanent outsider status by claiming maker-status. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Final wrist-tying crystallizes her reconfigured place with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rin’s desire to “find the place where echoes are born” is dramatized through every micro-choice: sketching repeating shapes, stealing seconds, breaking the cadence. Contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. acoustic obsession—play out in embodied beats (ink-stained fingers, pendant burning). The final renunciation of a clean ending is earned; cost is the uncountable debt of stolen time now literally hanging from her neck.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “tenderly furious” stance and reed-toy memory give her a tactile mind. The contradiction between conjurer’s proof-demand and sisterly ache drives every beat; the final renunciation—accepting the unretrievable—pays off prior causality. Micro-choices (placing eyes, repairing tile) externalize hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; solo arc still earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—secrecy vs. the ache to be felt—are alive in every tactile beat; the final micro-choice (pressing the shard to his own cheek) crystallizes the cost of visibility without exposition. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that the child’s stake remains off-stage; the relationship crucible is implied, not tested under joint pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. bodily fusion—drives every micro-choice; the thickened nails and root-taste are visceral cost. The final renunciation of control is earned because her prior scrubbing and measuring fail, leaving the tactile intimacy she both feared and courted. Circuitous sincerity shows in how she deflects customers with stories while her hands betray her; the trait alters tactics, not just tone. One slip: the boy’s instant comprehension feels like an external validation rather than a pressure she must survive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is character-specific (“salt in my lungs,” “porous for disbelief”) and embodied; the insomnia fuels the porous credulity that lets the compass vision land. Yet the decisive exchange of brooches feels lightly motivated—no prior beat shows the painter valuing future art over the sister relic; the renunciation cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Relationship with Mara stays observational; no status shift or mutual risk tests the protagonist’s hierarchy of values. Still, the flaw-driven mistake (trading away the clear brooch) compounds and is accepted, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lan’s interior fight—“remembering children he had comforted”—delivers embodied contradiction under possession; Sera’s micro-choice to sing dish-washing and net-mending reframes the stake and pays the cost. The moment the force exits through his confession, both characters’ motives crystallize with felt price. Relationship as crucible is light but sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “reactively visionary” trait is dramatized through on-the-spot map revisions and the staged three-evening assemblies; the contradictory pull between archival duty and communal healing is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays concrete (“turned the valve in her palm and realized…”). The final choice—to postpone the trumpet’s sounding until the town can exhale together—carries visible social cost (angry shutters, shaken Ilven) and is earned by the spaced intervals she earlier enforced.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s compulsive cartography and the flask-shaped admission are embodied in micro-choices (kneeling to the seam, pocket placement of the punch). Interior contradiction—precision vs. self-deception—drives every beat; the final renunciation costs her the safety of silence and is causally seeded by the phantom punch’s earlier clicks. No head-count or relationship pressure on page, so bullets 6–8 N/A. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses act in scene and the final stance is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. the need to host others’ grief—are alive in every beat; her micro-choice to keep writing while doubting charges the ending. The final renunciation (leaving pages pinned for strangers) costs her the clean ending she secretly wants, earned by the prior nights of shared ink. Jory’s pressure on her hand and memory knot is specific, never generic sympathy. Only the brother-fever backstory is told late and abstractly, blunting interior contradiction a hair short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ilias’s boredom-as-cowardice crystallizes late and powers the final surrender; the amulet’s pull on his “dimensional awareness” gives one concrete micro-choice that costs his immortality. Interiority stays specific—lightning bores him, curiosity is “manufactured”—but the beat where he “finally meant the word” is slightly abstract; a sharper embodied cue would clinch 9+. Maris’s guarded fatigue is sketched in two refracted images that efficiently force his decision. Overall, a strong arc of immortal avoidance → earned self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s ledger-in-the-head and “how much truth buys safety” give a sharp, specific internal contradiction; her choice to write Sami’s real story in Mercy’s ink crystallizes that conflict with visible cost. Ivo’s charm remains a touch generic, but his collapse in the face of her refusal lands because the story lets us watch the con fail in real time. The unclaimed woman’s tag used as a moral counterweight is a deft micro-choice that reweights Mara’s values on the page. One hairline slip: “smaller” in the doorway is label-not-shown; a single physical cue would have pushed this to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Haru’s studious precision, paste-scented hands, and need to “collect textures of time” are concrete and particular; his micro-choice to climb the mountain with the notepad externalizes the internal drive. The final act—folding the notepad away—caps his arc with earned stasis: he accepts silence yet retains agency over time’s naming. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping him just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s synesthetic “sound-into-touch” filter is embodied every time he steers a forklift or pockets a scrap of voice; the layering of stolen stories gives him provisional selfhood, and the final act of dispersing the solvent-smeared files is a credible renunciation that costs him the very archive he craves. Interior contradiction is alive—he both cherishes and scatters the names—yet the beat-to-beat micro-choices (prying open 9H, hiding folders, whispering names) keep agency on the page. The only minor drag is a slight over-articulation of the metaphor (“I had become a vessel”) that momentarily abstracts the body under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—skeptical myth-buster vs. ache-chaser—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to “retell” his mother’s warning with a kinder ending visibly tilts the compass and costs him the safety of old cynicism. Interiority stays concrete (“wiped his damp cheeks” after laughing at the melodrama), never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation—needle vanishes, glass clear—earns its poignancy because every prior retelling has already stripped his armor. Flaw: we never feel his body under stress; the observatory stays a mind-space more than a physical crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ira’s interior contradiction—paycheck vs. childhood—surfaces early and drives every beat; the final offer to Vell crystallizes it with visible cost (her exhaustion, the city’s drift). Embodied emotion is lean but present: “hope rise and panic chase it” anchors the chip moment. Dual allegiance is dramatized, not declared, through midnight tagging and daytime smiles. Competence is balanced by real jeopardy; no amnesia or label-speak. Still, the beat-to-beat micro-choices are summarized rather than rendered in scene, keeping her from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the iodine-clock ritual and the covert photograph mission; the contradictory pull between duty and private witness is felt every time she cracks an ampoule. Eli’s quiet resistance—offering the sand grain, deciding to keep walking—gives the relationship a crucible that crystallizes in the shared hush. Cost is visible: the sky surrenders, the crater is already fenced by future lights, the grain and negative are pocketed as relics. Interiority stays concrete; only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling in “ashamed that a report…was just her cover.”

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s tactile, sound-based agency is vivid and consistent; the “listen to tools and people” line crystallizes his interiority. Blindness is not a gimmick—every beat of repair is filtered through embodied perception, and the final calibration tag shows earned competence under pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ quick test fails, capping at 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Riven’s dry editorial wit surfaces in the Ministry “joke” and the “single throat” line, but the interior contradiction never hardens into a decisive on-page choice—he traces the droplet, listens, and the cost is only projected (“maps are weapons”). The phrasebook-as-inheritance adds texture yet doesn’t force a micro-choice under pressure; Lysa’s calm functions more as scenic foil than crucible. Earned stasis is credible, but the absence of an irreversible action keeps the arc just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sava’s “cryptic” label is asserted, not dramatized; his riddles stay ornamental. The interior contradiction promised by the fork’s warning note is never embodied in a visible choice—he simply keeps walking. Mara’s arc is cleaner: her decision to join re-balances the town, but the cost (bled soles, exile risk) is told, not felt. Still, the pair’s braided rhythm gives enough micro-choice to keep the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—survival instinct vs hunger for the ephemeral—collide in two visible micro-choices (cut/not-cut the wire, inhale the hush) that cost her last air and foreclose surface escape; embodied panic and filial memory feel specific, not diagnostic. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The boy’s hunger to “finish” his father’s story by chasing hush is concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (hovering, lattice-listening, leaving the door ajar) flows from that need. Interior contradiction is alive—he both wants the dead named and wants eyes averted—yet the cost is felt only obliquely in the final hush transfer. A hair more embodied price at the climax would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—clinging to survival-guilt while courting self-annihilation—are dramatized in the bead-transfer beat. The renunciation costs his literal pulse, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“mournful elation”) flirt with label-speak. Still, the final endurance reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ila’s interiority is lyrically specific—“overlaps,” “footsteps laid over his own”—and her weaving motive is embodied in every beat. The shift from passive watcher to active “sew a path” is visible, but the cost (aproned plate, orchid nets) stays more symbolic than visceral; we feel her conviction more than her skin in the game. Brother’s sleepwalking return supplies backstory catalyst, yet his on-page absence keeps relational crucible off-stage. Still, her haunting optimism drives every micro-choice and the final communal procession reads as earned renunciation of old fear.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—trusting work while doubting miracles—drives every micro-choice; her decision to stay and keep wandering crystallizes on-page with visible cost. Embodied emotion is specific (“apple smelled faintly of incense and soil”), never label-speak. The final renunciation of departure is earned by the orchard notebook beats and reframes diaspora return as ongoing motion. Only minor: her “warmly curious” trait is named more than dramatized in late beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pseudonymist’s curiosity, tactile chalk-mapping, and split-second invention of “M. Return” show clear micro-choices under rising pressure; the trembling courier supplies external stakes. Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional cost is more implied than embodied—no visceral contradiction or visible price is paid by the protagonist herself—so the arc lands just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s “foolish seamstress” mask is embodied in every micro-choice—off-key humming, braid unravelling, deliberate mis-stitching—so the disguise feels lived, not declared. The internal contradiction (listening vs. stitching, complicity vs. resistance) stays active in-scene, and the final half-tooth nudge shows a visible cost: she forfeits immediate safety to keep the real map alive. Only the Guard lieutenant remains a one-note functionary, preventing the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory need to keep the shard yet risk its healing, her embodied ritual of tearing unsealed letters, and the final micro-choice to hand the smoothed shard to Elias all track. Interiority stays concrete (“breath between pride and surrender”). The apology is earned because the text makes her rehearse it in front of spirits first; cost is the blood that rises and closes. Only restraint from 9: Elias’s interior remains opaque, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lani’s interior contradiction—professional composure versus private terror—grounds every micro-choice; the coral rub, the deliberate radio call, the final grafting metaphor all trace back to her need to convert shared fear into shared language. Mako’s “shrewdly innocent” smile is the only visible trait, but it lands as label-only; no embodied contradiction or cost is shown. The arm-cast archive is the crucible that forces her to act, so relationship-as-pressure is present even while the child sleeps. Closure is earned: she pays with the coral’s symbolic surrender and the ache in her voice, foreclosing the path of neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s longing for lost joy is concrete—she carries the fragment, aligns film, paints children back into being—yet her interiority drifts into lyric generalities (“Joy had gone missing… with soft resignations”). The final bow to ghosts crystallizes her wry self-awareness, but the dream logic cushions real risk, so the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to certainty while courting curiosity—are dramatized in the solvent-freezing moment; the final “I do not know yet” is earned by the looping awakenings that force her to relinquish control. Interiority stays concrete (echo-counting, coin-tapping) and the embodied cost is visible when the brush halts mid-stroke. The only minor slip is Tomas functioning more as acoustic mirror than full crucible, but the story’s drive is her self-interrogation, so relationship pressure is not required.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lio’s motives stay opaque—his “prank” smile never hardens into a testable choice—so the final scatter-pattern feels authored rather than earned. The narrator’s fear reorganizes in a single compressed image, but the interior contradiction (love of privacy vs. public risk) is asserted, not dramatized in a beat where we see the cost. Still, the micro-choice to lead auditors into the butterfly room while the vines outside take root gives a visible pivot that scales to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—soft-spoken yet “shyly unstoppable”—is dramatized in the solitary descent and the deliberate tearing of the postcard; the green-root epiphany is an embodied, costly choice. The centuries-long lineage is told, not shown, so the inherited weight feels abstract rather than personally bruising, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s quiet, ritualized devotion is vividly embodied in micro-choices—counting steps, breathing in fours, polishing stems—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction surfaces when “foxglove regret” chokes him as he passes mute orchids, showing cost without label-speak. The final shift from regret to gratitude is earned because the repaired chime lets him release the names he could not free before; the cost is the years of silence he endured. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority remains coherent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “carefully reckless” paradox is lived: she measures risk, hides the codex, then publicly bleeds for trust. Interiority stays concrete—ink darkening under vows, discord stinging skin—never drifting into label-speak. The final hand-off of the ink well shows earned change: secrecy becomes shared stewardship, cost paid in reputational ruin and raw shame felt by all. What keeps her from 9.0 is the slight off-stage feel of Ilyon’s parallel betrayal; his voice is less embodied, muting the crucible between them.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—engineer’s certainty vs. caretaker’s empathy—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands, chain offer, and final steady grip trace a visible cost. Rolen’s silent swallow and confession supply credible secondary pressure. The only keep-away from 9 is that Rolen’s “slyly heartfelt” trait is asserted rather than embodied in diction or gesture before the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s distrust-turned-risk is embodied in the meteorite pendulum and bird-choice ritual; the final release carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“balance on a narrow beam between rafters” shows trust regained through body, not label. One beat only, so depth caps at 8.4, but contradiction and micro-choice are on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip listening to wood, counting breaths against rings—yet the epiphany “sacred thresholds were not places but measures” is declared, not dramatized with simultaneous contradiction. The final renunciation (she builds her own maze of doors) carries visible cost, satisfying earned stasis, but the emotional turn is slightly too tidy for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting to read belonging yet fearing attachment—surfaces in her micro-choice to loosen the clamps; Jonah’s bolt-counting loneliness turns when he cups the lantern. Both arcs earn their shared exhale, but the final “beat in time” drifts toward label-speak, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motive is clear—map the vanishing paths—and the crater-glass micro-choices (tongue test, pulse test) embody the occupation. Interiority is lush yet consistent; the broken-promise twist gives Mira credible contradiction and cost. The narrator’s own flaw (smug “cheerful gloom”) is asserted more than dramatized, muting the final renunciation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s “orchestrated serendipity” is dramatized through the weighted chessboard and the bishop-wedge rescue; the micro-choice to hand the bishop to the watchwoman crystallizes his values and forces real-time risk. Interiority stays concrete (“numbers man” jab, salt-wind arithmetic) and the final renunciation—no claim of prophecy, only gate-setting—carries visible social cost as dawn strips the stage. The only slip is a hair of over-articulation in the closing paragraph’s “little gates for chance,” nudging the epiphany toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s dancer-trained attention to rhythm and gap anchors every micro-choice; the anchored-bench ordeal externalizes her refusal to surrender memory, body, and art. Interiority stays concrete—“warmth crawled,” “ink turned silver and cold”—never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation (fledge onward, not back) is earned by the night-long ordeal and costs her the safety of stillness. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s quiet, glass-attuned interiority is vivid and consistent; his “noctilucent reckonings” and pond-geometry divination give a memorable perceptual signature. The inspector’s late pivot is sketched more than dramatized, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites—status shift is declared, not staged. Still, Ilya’s final micro-choice (installing plain glass, not prism) crystallizes his value hierarchy with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory need to shield Eli yet carry her own guilt is dramatized through the porcelain box she still drags uphill; the micro-choice to confess is earned by the embodied ache of pack straps cutting “old burns.” Interiority stays concrete—stars “measure” miles, wax “stubborn” holds cracks—avoiding label-speak. Jonah’s parallel fear is sketched efficiently, but his voice converges toward hers in the final exchange, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mina’s interiority—logical dreamer who keeps proofs beside cloud sketches—remains concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (tying mirror shards, revising the wet-sand formula) externalizes her contradictory need for both certainty and mercy. The final basket ride crystallizes an earned endurance: she accepts that she may save only one timeline yet keeps launching, a visible cost paid in sleepless salt-stained pages. No stock labels; even “hope” is translated into coefficients. The only hairline slip is the off-stage townspeople’s instant belief, but her prior isolation in the grotto keeps the arc intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s listening gift is embodied in chalk taps and negative-frame alignments; the diary reveal turns her private quest into an inherited ethical burden. The final renunciation—submitting a false map to keep the chamber secret—carries visible cost: she forfeits professional credit and risks legal sanction. Interior contradiction is present yet thin: we are told she fears civic exploitation but never see her weigh a single tourist’s face or profit figure. Still, the beat where she “lets her mother’s apology answer” crystallizes endurance as stance, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s contradictory calm vs. panic, the embodied “borrowed heartbeat,” and the final micro-choice to release it all track cleanly; the painter remains archetypal, but the POV’s interiority is specific and the renunciation costs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven atonement vs. tactical patience—are dramatized in the tremor she feels when the terrace “tilts,” embodying cost. Micro-choices (arriving early, selecting the ruin, surrendering the corridor map) align with her need for redemption and alter the room’s chemistry. The final vow exchange crystallizes her hierarchy of values: ritual labor over absolution. Burn-scar reveal and clipboard weight give embodied continuity; no head-hopping or label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Inez’s contradictory impulses—arithmetical philanthropy vs. secret sentiment—are dramatized in every beat: she orders a drought, yet cuts her own soles on the salt to follow a bird’s ghost. The final gesture of smashing the egg is earned by the prior micro-choice of carrying it hollowed and wired; the cost (irreversible silence) is felt on the page. Interiority stays concrete: “her throat tightened with a feeling she never let her lawyers see” shows embodied secrecy without label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the moral ledger remains slightly abstract—no single human victim is named—so the cost, though real, is one notch short of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interior contradiction—body as poem yet weaponized chastity—drives every micro-choice; the sister-echo memory converts stillness into motive force. The final bow crystallizes a new bodily grammar, cost paid in the governor’s hollowed voice. One beat of label-speak (“alarming serenity was her shield”) keeps her from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s contradictory impulses—serenity masking guilt, artistry weaponized—are dramatized in embodied beats: the coat left behind, ink moving “backward,” fingers trembling on the carved questions. The final renunciation (contract on a napkin) is earned by the reversed puppet show that forces him to see harm. Mara’s request “don’t use me” crystallizes cost; his compliance forecloses his former method. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s interiority is vivid—his “esoteric realist” creed shows in measurable acts (rope, reed, notebook) rather than label-speak. The contradiction between saving butterflies and accepting erasure is embodied when he tightens the notebook cord until it “held firm again,” a micro-choice that pays the cost of remembrance. The only drag: the technicians remain names, not pressures, so the relational crucible is absent and the final voice-break feels slightly under-cued.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caster’s guilt-driven precision and tactile care are embodied in every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between hurry and gentleness is alive in scene. The final act of casting the bronze strip crystallizes a credible renunciation of silence, paying the cost of public exposure. The only minor slack is the Archivist, who functions more as prompt than secondary pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the protagonist’s flaw actively shapes every beat and the closure is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s “foresight-hindsight-only” blindness is dramatized through every forked choice and dream-walk; the final blood-print on the wafer dust shows a micro-choice that costs flesh and forecloses retreat, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete—tasting wet concrete, feeling the hatch “sigh” open—never drifting into label-speak. The only drag is a touch of self-mythologizing (“need to be worthy of being chosen”) that slightly abstracts the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nabu-iddin’s frugality, grief, and empirical irony braid into every micro-choice—re-using tablets, testing the tile against his own star logs, snapping his trusted stylus. The interior contradiction between data-faith and omen-need is lived, not declared, and culminates in a costly renunciation that forecloses his former identity. No stock phrases; body and tool use are specific and character-bound. The only restraint from 9+ is that the final beat keeps the cost largely symbolic rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s scheming pacifism is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—palming the music box, mouthing silent appeals, pressing memory into brass—so the contradiction between manipulation and mercy stays active in scene. Mara’s shift from knife-ready suspicion to letting the blade fall is credibly incremental, driven by bodily memory rather than authorial fiat. The one soft spot is the interior tag “scheming pacifist” itself, which surfaces as paraphrase just before climax, slightly diluting the earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s artisanal precision and dream-haunted nights give him a sharp, specific interiority; the breathing metronome turns his body into a tool, showing embodied emotion under pressure. The final act—holding breath to anchor dream into mirror—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Yet the arc flirts with abstraction: we see the dream’s pressure but not a contradictory impulse that would complicate his grounded nature in-scene. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (craft > dream > fusion) is legible and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—pride in her own rectitude vs. the guild’s betrayal—drives every beat; the micro-choice to thread a cracked lens into a child’s quartz eye crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the last vestige of licensed identity. The children’s status shift from clients to witnesses tightens the crucible. Only the grandson’s diction briefly flattens into adult-like aphorism, a minor voice leak.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—curator’s duty vs. hunger for forbidden knowledge—remains vivid and embodied; the bathroom mirror beats crystallize her aging dread. Yet the final acceptance (“keep history honest by keeping it complicated”) is asserted more than dramatized: we see no micro-choice that enacts the cost (she simply re-boxes the cameo). The grandmother-cameo externalizes guilt, but Mara’s agency in that moment is off-stage, softening the earned sting.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. rescue compulsion—surfaces in the diary key moment, but Orren’s childhood offer is summary, not embodied choice. The final renegotiation shows earned cost: she trades correction for lives, foreclosing the curator’s hoarding. Yet the “carefully resourceful” trait is asserted more than tested; twine and lamp vanish after first mention, muting micro-struggle. Still, her grammar-as-spell agency feels individual, not archetype, and the silence-equals-omission flaw drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s yearning for her twin is vivid, but the chimera-twin identity stays abstract; we never feel two patterns wrestling inside her body under threat. The emerald card and bedtime tale function as external props rather than embodied drives, so the climactic “pinning” feels symbolic, not viscerally earned. Interiority drifts into lyric summary (“held her purpose like an unkindled solace”) that tells longing rather than showing contradiction in muscle, breath, or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “warmly methodical” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—naming braid-strands aloud, steadying the lantern—so the final decision to publicize the treaty feels earned. Interior contradiction is light (anger → purpose) but lands via concrete action. The absence of on-page secondary characters keeps relationship pressure off the table; still, her stance crystallizes with visible cost. Meets 9- gate except for slight emotional reserve under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sava’s interior contradiction—panic vs hammered repose—remains embodied and specific; the ripple-marks on her wrists tingle under pressure, anchoring motive in flesh. Her micro-choice to offer the stone as covenant, not weapon, crystallizes a cost (the caves must forever host the beings), earning the quiet she seeks. No secondary character exerts pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean. The only limit: the final endurance reads slightly serene given the scale of the gamble—still credible within her sonic asceticism.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The custodian’s obsession—“to prove that coincidences have meaning”—drives every tactile choice (wrapping the prism, fitting the hush shard, aligning the lens) and is paid for by the risk of staying alone; the interior contradiction between faith in pattern and fear of randomness is kept alive right through the final flash exchange, giving the character a credible, embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is textured—pockets of reed pens, the ache of borrowed childhoods—and the final act of offering personal memory to steady the fog is a micro-choice that costs identity-boundaries, satisfying the 9+ test. The only bar to 9.0 is that the widening of self is asserted more than dramatized in body or aftermath; we feel the hush but not the bruise.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jorin’s interior contradiction—playful defiance against despair—drives every beat; the moment he loops the kerosene rag round the boy’s wrist the cost is felt. Micro-choices (chant cadence synced to fuse timing) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—handing over his talisman—earns its weight because the rag has already survived “every border fire.” Only the council’s collective shift is reported, not dramatized, keeping the arc just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—record vs. release, stay vs. migrate—are dramatized in micro-choices (handling cicada, hiding jars) and embodied in tactile detail. Iven’s shift from anger to fear is shown through thumb on seam and silence, not labels. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she foregoes immediate confession of the hidden copies, accepting relational risk. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The claustrophobic daughter’s embodied panic and micro-choices (three-breath/one-open exposure) track credibly; her final inhalation without scraping shows earned shift. Father’s quieter-stories credo stays consistent, but his own interiority is kept off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-way. No contradictory impulses in-scene for the father, capping just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet vocation and tactile micro-choices (brake tap, collar meter check) embody a believable hierarchy of values; the interior contradiction between vigilance and vulnerability is shown, not told. Mara’s grief is rendered through embodied gesture (twisting the map) and shifts in attention rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—Mara stepping steady into wind after learning to “listen for the pauses”—carries visible cost in the transferred weight of silence. Interiority stays concrete; only the mother anecdote flirts with 20 % reflection cap yet it tilts present tactics, so the arc earns its stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ione’s “wisely adventurous” trait is dramatized in the micro-choice to drive into the waterfall and later to refuse the crown; the interior contradiction between custodial caution and hunger for the edge is kept alive in scene. The final renunciation carries visible cost—she exits with no crown, only a story—earning Earned Stasis. One slip: the emotional register at the throne interface drifts toward abstract self-explanation (“never been about owning”), slightly blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her ritual severings, scar-naming, and final choice to let Lio inhale through her wounds all feel earned. The contradiction between her self-imposed exile and the need to re-connect is dramatized, not declared. One minor slip: Lio’s shadow-form never quite acquires independent desire, so the relationship crucible cools a notch before the final breath. Still, her loaded emptiness turns from poison to porous lung on the page, meeting the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s pyramid-scarred shame is embodied in the chalk-bricks memory and drives her refusal to re-sell illusions; the final act of public confession crystallizes her shift from con-artist to alchemist of communal truth, paying a felt social cost as she exposes her worst memory to the drum. Interior contradiction is alive when she both fears the returning slogans and wields them as origami mushrooms, showing simultaneous self-disgust and playful mastery. Micro-choices—slipping lantern spores, swapping swagger for humility—reveal a hierarchy that prizes restitution over self-protection, all anchored in sensory immediacy of indigo spores and damp aisles.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leander’s mute resolve and scholar’s hunger are shown through tactile micro-choices; the abdication carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The single on-page character limits relationship crucible, but status tension with absent ministers is implied through silence. Earned renunciation meets 9- gate; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, only steady resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Calven’s guarded interiority is rendered through precise, embodied micro-choices—tracing ciphered loops, unsnapping armor in mimicry—that externalize his need to “capture possibility.” The final renunciation of his sworn silence is earned by the marionette’s heartbeat-compass and costs him his old identity; contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-belonging) play out in scene, not summary. Only the captain-voice citation flirts with label-speak, but it is immediately re-voiced as Calven’s own whisper, keeping the beat intact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s grief-rooted need to “magnify small kindnesses” is embodied in every micro-choice—reading blotches, cutting twine, drafting the letter—so the final shared silence with Josie feels earned. Interiority stays concrete; the button’s warmth and sour smell anchor emotion in body, not label. The only minor slip is the single-sentence articulation of motive in paragraph 1, which edges toward thesis-statement, but the next beat immediately re-embodies it, so cost remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “smallness as cover” is dramatized in every beat—trading batteries, copying seals, risking the booth—so the underestimated trait is lived, not labeled. Interiority stays concrete (“door in her chest opening”) and her final choice to swap printing plates is earned by the prior watermark clue. The courier’s brightened gaze supplies external confirmation of her agency, but the story keeps the spotlight on her micro-choices. One hairline slip: the ledger voice summarizes her erased lives rather than letting her react beat-by-beat, a minor flattening that keeps this just outside the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s interiority is lyrically specific—vested hush as inherited silence—but the final renunciation (“exhaled it out as pure blankness”) is asserted rather than dramatized with bodily cost; we feel the loss conceptually, not viscerally. Contradictory impulses (preserve mother’s voice vs erase prophecy) are named, not simultaneously enacted in a single beat. Still, the occupation-silence link gives him memorable individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s quiet, ritualized patience is vivid—his “mossy delight,” the smell of rain on his fingers—but the interior contradiction between obedience and rebellion stays summary. The decisive act (opening the vault) is prepared by motif, yet the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied: we are told he “felt a shy mossy delight creep up his ribs,” not shown how that delight collides with terror of the tree falling. Still, the micro-choice chain (sort → prod → build → read → open) tracks cleanly and the final return to trays carries a credible, scaled cost: he must live inside the system he has changed.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—trading certainty for doubt—drives every beat; the midnight-chime obsession and gear-in-pocket habit embody it. Her bargain with Corin crystallizes the flaw into a costly choice: surrender the compass rose to build a probabilistic clock, renouncing the admiral’s rage-driven certainty. The stance shift is earned, visible, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—trading her childhood to weigh a name—grounds every beat; the final renunciation of stolen names is earned and costs her identity mass. Embodied grief (“shame that feels newly polished”) stays specific, never label-speak. The only drag: Ellis appears late, so their status crucible is sketched rather than pressured in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—laughter as medicine against her own grief—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she lays the crocodile tooth in Elowen’s palm crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“Mara felt the old guilt in her own wrists”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent. The arc earns its renunciation: Mara reclaims her own grief only after Elowen’s laugh dissolves the phantom bundle. One hairline slip: “modestly fearless” is told, not shown in body.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is visceral and body-bound; the proprioceptive curse makes every joint “confess,” a lived contradiction that drives all later choices. The decision to read the mercy-equation aloud is earned: only a body tuned by cruelty can unlock the archive, so the final walk-back costs the last of his safety. No second character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; survivor’s self-interrogation suffices. Flaw persists: he remains complicit recorder, not savior—an enduring cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The translator’s interiority is concrete—tracing the spiral, tasting salt words—yet the final beat of “speaking names into street corners” is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels slightly abstract rather than embodied. Still, the hierarchy of values (mother’s injunction vs. civic forgetting) is legible and drives every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s observant trait is embodied through tactile dust-reading and ladder-mark detection, grounding his ghost-engaging ritual in vocational skill. Interiority stays concrete: “responsibility without a body” crystallizes his liminal burden. The final chalk mark and pocketed mainspring show a micro-choice that costs him continued haunting duty, earning credible endurance. Yet the ghosts remain symbolic mirrors rather than pressure sources, so the relational crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s distrust of perfection and longing for Mara are concrete and embodied; the bottled whisper gives him a tactile link to the past that drives every beat. His micro-choice to place the vial under the platen crystallizes the stakes and forecloses retreat. Interiority stays specific—no label-speak—and the final Earned Stasis (compressed eternity) carries visible cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible inert.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Len’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary nostalgia vs. curatorial humility—cohere in the velvet-over-mirror gesture and the final poem; the shard’s deliberate fracture reweights his failed past into open futures, paying the cost of certainty. Interiority stays embodied (“burnished sorrow softened into resolve”) and drives micro-choices. Yara’s grief is sketched more lightly but still forces a joint stance change. Only the sister-loss reference feels briefly abstract, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ivo’s quiet competence and the embodied moment of “mending what isn’t torn” give him clear motive and micro-choice; the interior contradiction (borrowing forbidden stone, risking truth) is present but remains summary until the final ascent, softening the felt cost. The oathfern’s live feedback is a nice externalized conscience, but the emotional stakes stay cerebral rather than visceral. Still, the arc of repairman-as-healer-of-darkness is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “sensibly eccentric” label is shown, not told—she labels rain jars yet pays bills. Interiority stays concrete: the compass hinge clicks “as though it has joints of memory,” a sensory, character-specific image. The final renunciation—leaving the compass and pouring petrichor into the lagoon—carries visible cost because she relinquishes both proof and possession. One hairline slip: “she understands why she has come” is slightly abstract, but the next sentence immediately grounds the insight in the lagoon image, so the epiphany remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s impulse to sculpt under pressure is vivid and embodied; the lantern-slide handshake with Nora crystallizes her learning drive. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final pocketing of the slide shows earned, costed change. Yet the cross-temporal “alliance” is accepted with almost no interior friction, muting the stakes of her flaw. Still, her craft-as-language motive powers every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina’s quiet obsession with the postcards and the night-bloom question is vivid and embodied; her decision to climb the transept window crystallizes her arc. Yet the interior contradiction between grief and wonder could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized. The final “tender dark” realization lands with cost, but the beat immediately before it feels slightly rushed, muting the emotional punch. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—trained to treat grief as datum yet scalded by salt-smoke—grounds a believable, embodied arc; the final vow to publish with redactions is earned by the retrocognitive cost (palms arranging kelp, childhood accent hijacked). Micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to spell with shells, deciding “archives are doors”) crystallize values, though the single-scene compression keeps the flaw/competence balance more asserted than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sen’s refusal of easy miracles is embodied in every micro-choice (soap on shrine steps, sealed bottle as lesson); the final council scene crystallizes his renunciation with visible social cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the bottle’s pulse gives a sensory hook for his fear of relapse. The shift from solitary alchemist to charter-founder is earned beat-by-beat; grandchildren test anchors the moral stakes. Only the woman’s return feels slightly under-motivated, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Erem’s vocation and private obsession are cleanly fused; the heartbeat-in-wax discovery triggers an immediate, credible shift from archivist to actor. Interiority stays concrete—his tongue “vibrates like an instrument,” his terror is the felt weight of “sworn the city into failure.” The final act—broadcasting in dead vow-tongue—pays off earlier linguistic set-up and costs him institutional cover, an earned stasis. Only minor: we don’t see how this secrecy will haunt him beyond tonight, so the cost, while visible, could bite deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—yearning to touch stolen time yet fearing its cost—are dramatized in the tactile seed-sorting ritual; the final renunciation (restoring bots, planting one rye) is earned because every kernel he calibrates earlier now reads as prepaid debt. Interiority stays concrete: “quiet storm in his chest” is followed by the acorn cap warming “as if from a summer pocket,” anchoring emotion in sensory detail. The only minor slip is “furiously tranquil,” a label that momentarily abstracts the very tension it names.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maris’s interior contradiction—wanting alarms that warn without deafening—drives every micro-choice; the final switch costs her career risk and is earned by the glue-dry wait. “Credibly curious” stays embodied in sensor tweaks, not label-speak. The only slip: the dispatcher conflict is off-stage, so the relational crucible never fully pressurizes her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s porous grief is embodied in the way he bows to meteor charts and warms the lantern glass; the final invitation to the technicians shows a credible shift from isolation to shared vulnerability. Interiority stays concrete (“breath animal and measured”) and avoids label-speak. The brother’s death is the single reflective block that tilts his present stance, meeting BRR. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when he decides to trace meteors “not for calibration but to empathize,” foreclosing the path of silent mourning. Cost is felt in the soft laughter amid fragments—an earned stasis that accepts ongoing breakage.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s quiet, hoarding grief is embodied in the stained-glass box and the ritual of reading ghosts; the final release of the slips shows a credible, costly shift. Interiority stays concrete—wax scent on tongue, dust on a child’s knees—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is that the sister’s forgiveness line is delivered as a slip rather than earned through an in-scene choice, slightly blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—clinging to a fragment of grief while yearning to feel time’s texture—are dramatized in the urn-for-truth swap; the cost of timelessness is felt when his pulse vanishes. Interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final micro-choice (writing the radio tag) crystallizes his new unmeasurable duty. Minor slip: Mara’s motivation remains slightly off-page, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rian’s “warmly attentive” trait is dramatized in every beat—mending net, stitching kite, binding drake—so the label is earned, not asserted. Interiority stays concrete (feather barbs catching “like a hand trying to hold on”) and contradicts his itch for imperfection. Final renunciation—returning the feather after using it—costs him his talisman, sealing arc under Accumulative lens. Only minus: brothers’ status swing feels slightly quick for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s quietly defiant caretaker persona is vivid and embodied; her “brazen calm” under terminal news feels earned through tactile orchard work and diary precision. Interior contradiction surfaces when pain clashes with resolve while wiring oaks, showing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation—sharing the temple’s script rather than hoarding knowledge—pays visible cost as she yields center stage, fulfilling 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” identity is embodied through self-experimentation and refusal to kneel; the final theft of Pilgrim Salt crystallizes her academic rebellion with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak, and the contradiction between institutional duty and private curiosity plays out in the moment she cuts the shard. The only bar to 9.0 is that the pilgrims remain anonymous; no second character applies pressure, so the crucible is purely internal. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman’s vocation and filial inheritance give him a concrete, idiosyncratic lens; every micro-choice (decoding gull-calls, wading for silt) flows from that vocation. Interiority stays embodied—no label-speak—and the final renunciation of violence through gardening carries visible cost in the kneeling, the bucket, the chill. The only restraint from 9+ is that no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; he moves with steady purpose rather than internal split.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s nose-driven naming and Morrow’s grief-scarred intuition are vivid, but the final broadcast choice is confessed in summary, not dramatized; we feel the cost only by report, not by embodied refusal or risk. Interior contradiction is strong early (trust nose vs. fear path), yet the closing stance crystallizes off-stage, capping the arc just short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is textured and embodied—breath unspooling, temporal dissonance felt in bone—yet the “blessed pariah” label is asserted more than dramatized; no crewmate appears to challenge or confirm the status, so the social crucible is missing. The grandmother’s compass rose is handled twice with tactile precision, and the final choice to trust the sky’s needle over station arrows is credibly earned. Still, the internal contradiction between curse and calibration remains slightly abstract; a single beat of self-reckoning under the twin skies would have pushed it into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The apprentice-thief’s motive to “amend my last failure” is concrete and personal, and the micro-choice to let go of the railing crystallizes the interior contradiction between self-preservation and sacred playfulness. Embodied emotion stays specific—sundial lid “warm as a pulse,” knees on ice—never sliding into label-speak. Status shift with Serren is legible but compressed into a single laugh-line; a hair more cost to the narrator’s body or identity would push this to 9+. No causality break; the final leap is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Survivor-guilt historian is vivid; embodied micro-choices (ripping bundles, staged sobs) show contradictory impulses under pressure. Final renunciation—losing archive originals to save testimony—carries felt cost tied to sworn vow. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk; instead gesture-logic drives every beat. A hairline slip: “benevolently ruthless” is named once rather than dramatized as inner friction, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s buried gift for naming is credibly withheld and painfully re-activated; the decision to seed the stone with the raw goodbye costs voice and safety, earning the closing path. Interiority stays concrete—“tasting metal,” “hands went numb”—avoiding label-speak. One hairline slip: the seer’s apology feels slightly performative, not quite sharp enough to pierce status.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt-driven compulsion to “move differently” is embodied in every micro-gesture; the fidgeting, tapestry tracing, and final refusal to claim heroism all spring from the same self-reproach. The interior contradiction—needing to restart time yet refusing to play savior—peaks when she offers the draw to her past self in the mirrored gate, a choice foreshadowed by her earlier cruelty to the prince. Cost is legible: she exits anonymously, satchel lighter of praise but heavier of earned quiet. The only bar to 9.0 is a slight externalization of regret in “memory of the prince's last command” rather than a present-tide of shame.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory drives—guilt-driven truth-telling versus self-preservation through art—are dramatized in every beat; the final renunciation of color vision costs her the very perceptual weapon she wielded, a price legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “rainbows trembling on bone”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to fracture the killer’s name across three stanzas crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Only the guard’s switch from duty to complicity feels slightly under-motivated, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s interior contradiction—alchemy as control vs surrender—drives every micro-choice; the final act of clipping the charm to the gear is a visible, costly renunciation that seals her arc. Embodied emotion is vivid (“molten gold into the fracture lines of my own regret”). The brother memory surfaces twice, each time altering present tactics; the forgiveness beat lands because the prior failures were dramatized, not confessed. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; solo arc fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic attachment vs. emotional evasion—are dramatized in the cave: he both hides the shell and re-paints it, speaks aloud the fear he has prettified. The final micro-choice (setting the shell where tide will intermittently erase/reveal it) crystallizes the arc with visible cost: he surrenders perfect distance for imperfect intimacy. Interiority stays concrete, body-attuned; no label-speak. One beat short of 9+ gate: the promise-tightening could have bitten earlier to force an even steeper concession.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The assistant keeper’s trembling hands and whispered summons embody a credible shift from passive listening to active, embodied risk; the final forehead-to-forehead silence with Jonas shows a relationship re-forged under pressure. Interior contradiction is vivid—“a need so fierce it could only speak softly”—and the choice to relinquish volume costs the protagonist his habitual invisibility. The only hairline slip: the phrase “screaming tenderness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the climactic beat, slightly blunting embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The navigator’s interior contradiction—clinging to a dead station while guiding returners—grounds every beat; the embodied shame when admitting “I do not know whether the midnight caller is saving us or counting us” crystallizes cost. Micro-choice chain (sketching, tilting the censer foot, handing Sera the map) keeps agency live. Only flaw: Sera’s reunion beat is seen from outside, so the relationship crucible never fully pressures the narrator’s own wound.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s involuntary-truth tic is embodied every time she speaks; the glass-eye test shows a credible micro-choice that alters her risk. The final burial of the relic is an earned renunciation that costs her future ease, visible on the page. Interiority stays concrete—”truth is a kind of shrapnel”—and avoids label-speak. Status play with Lio and the captain is legible and forces tactical silence, satisfying relationship-as-crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eamon’s “softly persistent” manner is dramatized in the way he coaxes the clerk to stay and in the tactile micro-choice of pressing the Edelweiss to the scar-free piling; the clerk’s interior contradiction between bureaucratic duty and reluctant empathy is embodied, not labeled. The final act of speaking the lost name and archiving the packet crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over ownership—at visible cost to Eamon’s already-thick loneliness. The only bar to 9-band is that the clerk’s stake never sharpens into a risk that could fail; his consent feels foregone rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s empirical intuition is shown, not told, in her trust of depth marks and ant-trail experiment; the final refusal to inherit Ellis’s debts crystallizes her autonomy. Interior contradiction is light—anger at silence v. recognition of shared fear—but sufficient for 800 words. Cost is legible: she forfeits the secret press and an easy inheritance to keep her “clean decision.”

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maelin’s exhaustion and refusal to be prophecy’s pawn are viscerally embodied; her decision to enter the fissure crystallizes a hierarchy of values (sleep over sovereignty) with visible soot-and-blood cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for rest yet gripping power—remains active in-scene, not abstract. The final renunciation is earned because every beat has shown her sickened by awe and menace alike. Minor slip: “softly commanding” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—equations vs. longing—grounds every beat; the shell test and hand-clasp are micro-choices that visibly cost. Toma’s shift from Academy envoy to co-conspirator is sketched more than dramatized, muting relationship pressure. Still, the final “we will be our own measure” crystallizes a shared renunciation earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“jealousy of his ignorance,” “counting unspent chances like coins”—and the final renunciation (“I chose to keep writing”) carries cost. Yet the younger/older self swap is reported more than embodied; we get no contradictory bodily cue during the swap, so the beat feels symbolic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iris’s anosmic aromatherapist background is concrete—she arranges vials by color, reads paper for fear. The moment she chooses to deliver the screw herself crystallizes her new identity: “a repaired object carried a message more honest than words.” Interior contradiction (need to heal others vs. absence of her own healing sense) stays active. Cost is felt when she admits she still “trembles,” yet walks anyway—Earned Stasis with price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ila’s contradictory impulses—terror of storms vs. need to master them—play out in real time through trembling quill-strokes; the burn-scar micro-runes she inks onto her own arm externalize the cost and lock the change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation of shame is earned because the rune she writes literally incorporates her brother’s weight once carried. Voice remains singular; master is functional backdrop, not relationship crucible, so bullet waived.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marin’s contradictory impulses—gossip-column cruelty vs. exorcist restitution—are dramatized in the wire-loop beat and the cracked-bottle cost; the apology’s 3-year lag and orchard petition in drawer show flaw-driven stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted ozone and old pears”) without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (writing correction on score) is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is philosophically rich but abstract; contradictions are declared (“end of history witness” vs. “next true word”) rather than dramatized in scene. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure is shown—every beat is summary. The claimed renunciation lands as concept, not felt cost. Character functions as cosmic mouthpiece, not person.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivar’s interior contradiction—precision shepherd who sabotages his own mother’s clock—drives every beat; the 47-second drift and deliberate winding-off crystallize his odd creed with visible cost. The inspector’s softened anger shows status shift under pressure, but the man remains more foil than crucible, capping relationship complexity a hair below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s spatial gift and night/day split job give her a sharp, specific interiority; the moment she palms the laser pointer as a “relic” shows micro-choice under pressure. The final betrayal of her employer is credibly foreshadowed by her private firmware hack and growing unease. Only minor slip: the “quiet wildfire of anger and relief” skirts label-speak in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The daughter’s need to “count what he refused to” is embodied in every micro-choice—lighting the lantern, pulling call numbers, mounting the exhibit—so her inherited compulsion and her refusal to repeat it wrestle in scene. The final palm-empty moment with her father lands as earned renunciation because the scavenger hunt has forced her to rehearse his addiction without placing the bet. Interiority stays concrete (“lantern’s small circle,” “palms empty at last”) and never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the father’s voice (via seat scrawls) does more dramatic lifting than hers in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guarded solitude and the micro-choice to break it with Lena are credibly rooted in her nightly ritual of “cultivated estrangement.” The glass-disc habit externalizes her contradiction—comforting others while avoiding her own sister—and the final call dramatizes the cost of that contradiction. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the embodied tremor of rubbing the disc “until it sang her courage” shows the moment she risks her safe loop. One hairline slip: the backstory block on Lena is efficient but slightly exceeds the 20 % soft cap, nudging down from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “gently thorough” nature is dramatized in every beat—her walnut-ink ritual, the deliberate rewriting of the oath, the public reading that forces the council’s hand—so the final renunciation of the sanitized record feels inevitable and costly. Interior contradiction is alive: archival duty collides with private guilt when the locket photo surfaces, and the embodied tremor in her hands as she inks the confession shows the price. The only bar to 9+ is that Jun himself remains off-stage; the emotional weight is filtered through Mara’s retrospective lens rather than tested in a live relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “desperately jocular” mask is shown through embodied action—laughter that feels hungry, jokes as fire-keeping—yet the interior contradiction (need hidden behind logistics) is only asserted, not dramatized in a beat where it slips and costs her. The narrator’s loneliness is concrete in the opening image of the unclaimed city, but the decisive shift from client to companion is compressed into a single yes, so the cost feels scaled to word-count rather than character depth. Still, micro-choices (cigarette → coat → child) tether the rock’s warmth to visible reciprocity, earning the shared silence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iris’s grief-driven vocation and tactile genius are vivid; the brother-stone heartbeat gives her a final, embodied cost. Yet the interior contradiction—wanting both to map and to drown in loss—stays summary; we never feel her momentarily wish to turn back. Micro-choices (ring bite, kneel) are present but sparse, so the arc reads more mythic than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation lands with felt weight: she exits carrying “steadier grief,” a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—firm clauses vs. sky-open uncertainty—drives every micro-choice; the final unbending of the nib costs her certainty and is earned by the dramatized garden error. No stock labels; emotion is embodied in the dry pen’s resistance. The single-POV crucible holds; the courier flashback is a causal micro-choice that alters present tactics. Missing 9+ only because the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is textured—emptiness as possession, camera as brass-bodied relic—and the final renunciation of the camera lands as earned stasis: grief transmuted to rhythm. Micro-choices (signing absence, lifting lens without film) externalize the stake of being unseen. Aster’s quiet charisma is shown through gesture, not label, and his guidance forces the protagonist to act under pressure. The only minor drag: Aster’s motivations remain opaque, so the relationship crucible never fully tilts.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sera’s contradictory drives—incendiary protector vs. tender archivist—are alive in every beat: she copies the reel instead of torching it, feeling the blister-memory “like magma.” The final choice to broadcast rather than burn is earned by the chain of artistic clues that force her to trade secrecy for exposure; the cost is the return of her public name, the very thing she tried to erase. Interiority stays concrete (“her chest roared”) and avoids label-speak even at peak heat. Only the off-stage Miko keeps this from a perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s quietly rebellious drum-tapping turns consent into covert agency; the shared-dream motive is embodied, not labeled. Interior contradiction pulses when the drug forces empathy with Sato, yet the beat keeps hijacking the protocol for the brother. The final choice—to return alone and drum the gate open—pays the cost of permanent outsider status, earned by every prior tap.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s tactile intimacy with the maze—folding maps by feel, tasting footstep rhythms—gives us a singular, embodied mind. The contradiction between her secrecy (hoarding the conduit) and her declared wish to protect crews fuels the climax; the moment she chooses to expose the secret to save the pinned stevedore, we see the cost in her “finger to lips” hush. Len remains a functional foil rather than a fully dimensional opponent, but the story needs no more at this length. The final refold of the map and coin-in-pocket registers a quiet, earned renunciation of her lone power—visible price, cleanly motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—her “blood mixed with rainwater” and the mirror-eye equivalence show contradiction under pressure. The guardian’s silence is a credible stance, not a void, and his micro-choices (tilting mirror, shutter code) alter her options. Her confession is earned: the mirror descent makes her prior complicity undeniable. Cost is visible—she bites through lip, speaks through pain—meeting the 9+ test, but the guardian’s spiral-calm trait stays more label than lived limit, capping just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s quiet resolve and “hear the unspoken” trait stay embodied—he listens to mist, students, the mayor’s silence—driving every micro-choice. The pawn-for-sapling endgame crystallizes his creed with visible cost: the grove saved, his own fatigue and risk left on the page. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, the tin’s weight and magnet tug externalize motive. One hairline slip: the mayor’s interior turn is inferred, not dramatized, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dock-worker’s poise and steady hands are shown, not told, and the final choice to “detach my own life from the dock” is earned by the scrimshaw beat and Rusk’s opened heart. Interiority stays concrete (“my ribs hum”) and the micro-choice to lever the first chain is legible cost. The only bar to 9 is that Rusk’s shift from warden to willing co-detacher feels slightly accelerated; one more line of visible internal battle would lock it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete—grief as “bruise,” the goat’s kick sparking a possible laugh—yet the narrator’s contradictory impulses (clinging to pain while hiring a joy-teacher) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in one compressed beat; the final permission to let grief move is earned, but the micro-choice that proves the shift is the silent walk to the fence, not a visceral fork inside the body.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s hunger to dissolve the boundary between living and dead is visceral and textually embodied; her paraphrase habit is a concrete micro-choice that alters the guards’ compliance and later softens the colonnade itself. The brother-loss motive is anchored early and drives every step; the final renunciation—walking forward until both selves become air—carries visible cost (Soren’s hand passing through cloth). Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens; no stock grief labels. Only the “aesthetically driven” trait remains slightly ornamental, never forcing a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” trait are dramatized through the plant-code negotiation and the portrait that cracks Joren’s reserve; the final shared star-light awakening shows earned change with mutual cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment she “knows she has found a lever” edges toward label-speak, keeping the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism-singer’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” drives every choice; the embodied listening, the refusal to shame Mara, the final decision to let raw voices air are all micro-choices that cost him institutional protection. Interiority stays concrete—sound has “weight and temperature”—and the closing renunciation of curated comfort is earned. Only the council’s off-stage demand feels slightly abstract, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s grief-soaked interiority is embodied in shaking hands and the salt-jar of ashes; every micro-choice (folding the bird, etching the ring) grows from her contradiction between self-erasure and the need to solder broken days. The final refusal of oblivion is earned because each origami act visibly loosens the “old hunger” while the ring-polishing beat keeps the husband’s absence as living constraint. Only the thin-girl visit feels slightly under-motivated—Lysa’s arrival is convenient, not compelled by Mara’s prior action—so the arc stops just short of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is textured (“steadily curious, not brave”) and embodied emotion arrives in small, specific tics (unspooling tape as trust ritual). The narrator’s micro-choice to accept the deck at the end crystallizes a credible shift from passive inheritance to active stewardship, paying a quiet social cost (promise to return). Aurel’s shame over steering traders supplies a secondary pressure point that sharpens the protagonist’s stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, keeping the arc slightly one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—"joy hurt like a pulled tooth" embodies the narrator’s paradoxical appetite for forbidden knowing. The contradiction between institutional obedience and private transgression is held in scene, not summary, and the final renunciation (teaching in spirals) costs her the safety of linear memory. Slight reserve: the emotional turn is foreshadowed so richly that the final weep feels pre-paid rather than freshly incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—clinging to a tactile stone while curating weightless dreams—drives every beat; the final act of handing the stone to the shadow is earned by this tension. Her “luminous regret” is embodied in the way she rubs the stone at dusk, not declared. The only bar to 9+ is that the shadow’s acceptance feels slightly too effortless; a sliver more resistance would have sealed the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—rage at betrayal versus duty to real animals—play out in embodied micro-choices (chalk lists, phone call, crate signing). The final renunciation of vengeance is earned by the prior beat of hearing Tessa’s panic and seeing her own mirrored fragility. Cost is visible: public admission of naïveté, loss of sleep, legal exposure. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulse—wanting scars to speak yet forcing them open—drives every beat; the final legible wound is earned by her successive choices to worsen the seam. Interiority stays concrete (“pain quieting to a distant pulse”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choices (flipping the hourglass, prying stones, reopening stitches) externalize the hierarchy: neighborhood healing > personal closure. Only the telepathy gift feels externally bestowed, not mined from flaw, keeping her from full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory hunger to steal light yet retrieve lost love is embodied in micro-choices—warming the can, threading blank film—so her final reading into white light costs her the privacy of her own unsent letters. Interiority stays specific: “spatially imaginative since childhood” maps the booth as a universe, not a label. The earned renunciation—labeling the can “deliver” and walking out—carries visible cost because the lyric loop finally quiets, proving the ritual completed. Flaw: we never feel her body under stress; the booth remains a mind-map more than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sel’s interiority is vivid—astrolabe pressed to ear, tasting grit—but the “moonstruck dreamer” label is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown under pressure; choices feel pre-ordained by cosmic destiny rather than earned internal friction. Still, the embodied sensorium and final exhaustion carry a palpable cost, satisfying the 9- gate for short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guard’s contradiction—dreamless yet tending “sparks”—is dramatized through micro-choices (nudging the switch, planting ember-seeds) that cost him dispersal across timelines. The final stance of permanent, multiversal vigilance is earned by the prior split and carries clear, scaling cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak even at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The philosopher’s interior contradiction—needing verification yet surrendering to unverifiable wind-music—drives every micro-choice; the final crank-turn physically externalizes the cost of abandoning that old epistemic contract, tears included. Embodiment is vivid (“my teeth tingled,” “tears reasonable”), never label-heavy. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s shame-to-courage shift is embodied in trembling hands and the loosened leash; the contradictory impulses (run/stay) coexist in scene. The dog as mirror works, yet the guides remain symbolic furniture—no interior contradiction or status friction is granted to them, so relationship-as-crucible is nil. Closure is earned: she holds the leash loosely, a visible cost paid for the earlier choke. Still, the guides’ instant benevolence softens the flaw-compounding that high-band entries require.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bellhop’s contradictory allegiance to the rule of silence and his need to give Edda a voice is embodied in the micro-choice to whisper “C.” That single syllable costs him a pager alert and crystallizes his stance. Interiority stays concrete—cold metal under the tongue, frost-flag breath—and the final quiet that protects without erasing feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orun’s “regally unpretentious” stance is dramatized in the refusal of the crown—an earned renunciation that costs him personal power and keeps him in the archive identity. The interior contradiction between titanic strength and gentle smile is shown through the careful heave that “honored the old artisans,” not declared. One slip: the moment he copies the ledger is summarized, so the micro-choice that seals his exposure of the pretender is slightly off-stage; this keeps him just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief-turned-measurement vocation is concrete and embodied; the atlas page she fingers is a lived object, not a symbol. The final choice—encoding the beacon schedule into tap code—carries visible cost: she surrenders the comfort of open knowledge to protect the reef. Interior contradiction (wanting truth vs. accepting secrecy) stays active in scene. Only minor slip: the hooded woman’s dialogue is slightly expository, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass ritual give a tactile, idiosyncratic core; the “awkwardly confident” trait shows in micro-choices (laughing at shaking hands, stepping onto stones). Interiority stays concrete—teeth singing, bones aligning—without diagnostic labels. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits stealth, stands exposed on the stones, letting thunder speak for her—Earned Stasis under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nara’s insurgent past and refusal to repeat implanted destiny give her a sharp, evolving motive; her decision to speak her story into the steam is a micro-choice that costs her the certainty of control. The salamander’s transformation validates her intent, showing earned change. Interiority stays concrete (“laughed once, surprised”) and avoids label-speak. One beat short of 9: we don’t feel the bodily cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mina’s survivor-grief is embodied in every beat: the drone-buzz freeze, the photograph crease as “ruined streets,” the decision to stay and label saplings with dates not wishes. Contradictory impulses—terror of sound vs. deliberate return to the cliff—play out in real time; the final act of burying the photo at the cypress roots costs her the last private relic, earning the stillness she seeks. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude. One decimal off perfection only because Dr. Harlow remains a polite cipher, supplying no reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her dread of mutating faces, her tactile re-weaving of light—yet the sister remains a cipher; the portrait’s eyes open, but the emotional cost lands more on concept than on a fully embodied contradiction. The final calm is earned, but the sister’s absence of on-page presence blunts the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Keir’s “serene anger” and “consciously wild” stance give him a sharp, consistent internal engine; the contradiction is shown, not told, in the slowed-time beats. His decision to stab the obelisk is the earned pivot that costs him the last of his ink and any written proof, so the renunciation lands with visible price. The only drag is that the Council of Hours remains off-page, so the relational crucible is theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—protect sister vs expose rot—are alive in the moment of scanning the letter; the final nod shows a paid-for shift in their relation. Interiority stays concrete, frost on cabinets, warm paper, no label-speak. Micro-choice of mis-filing as “public scholarship” crystallizes value hierarchy under pressure. Cost is legible: professional death now possible, archive no longer tomb but forum.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s pacifist ethic is embodied in micro-choices—sheathe the rifle, kneel the father, train roses to open only for empty hands—so her values actively constrain the climax. Tarek’s softening is credibly forced by the dome’s atmosphere and the tactile talisman, not sudden benevolence. Interiority stays concrete: “roses…burned orange and white in the filtered sun” rather than abstract mercy labels. The only limit: we get no contradictory impulse from Maris in the final beat; her certainty costs nothing new, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rovan’s calm, zig-zag rationality and the embodied ache in his ribs give a credible, contradictory pulse; the final renunciation of the spike is earned. Yet his interiority rarely surprises—cool-headed stays cool, no crack of panic or ego to complicate the choice. Mera is off-stage, so relationship crucible and status shifts are moot. Still, the micro-choice to seal the echo inside himself carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test edge.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s contradictory impulses—expose fraud vs. spare the observatory—play out in embodied micro-choices (testing plates, scratching the logbook). The rosewood nib as inherited conscience keeps her from repeating her father’s spectacle; the final renunciation costs her the scoop and risks her paper’s buzz, a price felt in the closing phone call.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s guilt is embodied (needle-buzz = submerged cry) and drives every move; the apology at the end is earned because the amber-tether choice literally rewires his skin and conscience. Interior contradiction is present—he both seeks and dreads hearing the cry—yet the sister remains off-stage, so the relational crucible is with himself, not another character. Still, the micro-choice to ink the comet-tail and clip the wire makes the cost visible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Inez’s interior contradiction—seeking meaning in engineered forgetting—drives every micro-choice; the mandala, tile taps, and final laugh all spring from that tension. Social perceptiveness is shown, not told, when she reads the teacher’s jaw tighten and times her intervention. The boy’s smudge and her acceptance crystallize earned change with visible cost: the mandala’s destruction enacts the theme that meaning lives only while touched. No label-speak; body and chalk breathe motive.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Samir’s interiority is vivid—his vow to “cradle empathy in arms of steel” is embodied every time the iron frame makes strangers flinch and he answers with deliberate warmth. The contradiction between weapon-like steel and gentleness is held in scene, not asserted, and drives his micro-choice to pocket the tessera and invite Lina onto the stone. Lina’s shift from contempt to complicity is traced through bodily detail (spit, staggered step, whisper) and crystallizes when she names her cousin. Cost is felt: Samir will keep reliving the fire, Lina must guard the boy she now feeds; both paths narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s synesthetic curse is made visceral—“tinny blue applause” on her tongue—so every later sensory crossover feels earned; her decision to speak her father’s name into the stage is the micro-choice that finally pays the cost of keeping the coin. The ghost’s hunger is sketched more than dramatized—he never risks anything tangible—so the relational crucible is one-sided, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s skepticism and warmth are embodied in micro-choices—hugging the lawyer, squeezing Jory’s hand—so motivation stays legible. The shift from doubt to “it does not matter” lands as earned stasis because the prior photo-protocol and tunnel walk dramatize the cost of listening. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, heat in ribs or cold in wrists tags belief. One minor slip: “affectionate skeptic” is never internally contradicted in a single beat, so the trait edges toward label, not lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mina’s sensory vocation and her mother’s fossil gift braid into a single, embodied motive: to let the caves speak rather than to speak for them. The contradiction—scientist vs. listener—plays out in micro-choices: she loosens the fossil instead of clutching it, names chambers aloud instead of cataloguing silently. The final renunciation—leaving the fossil in the alien handprints—costs her the last talisman of home, earned by every prior heat-reading. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “longing” is pinned to limestone temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysa’s quiet stubbornness is concrete—she pockets “trash,” pins buttons, times echoes—each micro-choice embodies her need to give the prophecy back to the workers. Interiority stays specific; no label-speak. The final act of collective release is earned because her patient cataloguing has visibly rewoven relationships (workers close ranks). Cost is felt: the foreman loses control, the warehouse’s future is foreclosed to the owners.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rina’s contradictory impulses—self-reproach versus the need to repair—are dramatized in the salt-on-burns moment, grounding her arc in embodied cost. The pillbox as confession/tool crystallizes her hierarchy of values without exposition. Her final placement of it on the beam is a micro-choice that forecloses retreat, earning the quiet change. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s grief-honed vigilance is embodied in every micro-gesture; the yarn needle as tactile memory keeps Mara present without exposition. The moment he demands the unadorned confession, his contradictory currents—vengeance, longing, fatigue—collide in a single, costly choice that re-opens his life. Senn’s trembling admission supplies external pressure, but Rowan’s final act of scratching “I owe” into the palimpsest is the earned renunciation that forecloses further bargaining. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the silence after the gutters stop is the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Galen’s quiet, tactile curiosity is consistent and embodied; the lantern-cradling beat crystallizes his “sharp gentleness.” Yet his interiority never quite splits under pressure—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time—so the final rotation feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won. Sera’s twin-state face-fusion supplies micro-cost, but Galen’s own stake in the choice stays level.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “wistfully pragmatic” stance is embodied in every micro-choice—climbing down to the harbor, wedging mirrors, tending stripped canes—so the trait is lived, not labeled. The contradiction between tenderness for plants and readiness for covert action creates active tension under pressure. One beat short of 9: we never feel her hesitate or misstep; competence edges out flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s guilt and self-reproach are lived in muscle and breath. The decisive renunciation—choosing coexistence over resurrection—carries visible cost in the copied, error-marked pages. The lone weakness: the “tool” self-label is asserted early but not dramatized in a concrete micro-choice that hurts, so the final shift feels slightly pre-conceived rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ghostwriter’s contradictory impulse—hiding the one letter meant for himself—drives the decisive turn; the withheld apology is embodied in trembling fingers on the twig spiral and costs him the public confession he orchestrates. Interiority stays concrete (“my throat tightened”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: keep secrets > risk exposure > accept Arin’s hand. Earned stasis lands with felt cost: the ribbon tied through the nest literalizes the bind he feared.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—hope against distrust—drives every micro-choice; the decision to feed a false map is earned by her prior recognition of the sky-listening pattern and costs her the safety of neutrality. Embodied emotion is sharp (“hands steady despite the grit under her nails”). The final renunciation—handing over control to the town—carries visible cost: she forfeits sole authorship of the shield and accepts possible misuse.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The claustrophobic explorer trait is embodied through the refusal of torchlight and the fingertip compass balancing—micro-choices that cost time and risk exposure. Interiority stays concrete (“lungs tighten,” “kept the sky in mind”) and the final act of planting the point is a credibly cautious rebellion. The mentor’s transparent presence is accepted without explanatory padding, letting the protagonist’s steady-handed fear drive every beat. No label-speak intrudes at peak pressure, so the arc earns its renunciation with visible tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The face-blind artist’s methodical nature is dramatized through calipers, ledger, and the act of drawing contradictions into a composite face; interior contradiction surfaces when empathy is claimed yet complicity in “looking away” is admitted. Micro-choices—spreading tools, stepping forward with the pencil—show agency under pressure. The final offer to paint the lost dancers crystallizes a moral stance with visible social cost, satisfying earned change. Minor slip: Maren’s twitch is read with implausible certainty by a face-blind narrator, a POV stretch that nicks credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory mix of archival caution and ancestor-loyalty is embodied in the tremor she feels when the copper nail “rings” on Sato’s desk; the micro-choice to confront him with the relic crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The final beat—uploading the correction while dread drains into the sea—earns a credible renunciation of her earlier need for institutional approval, paying a visible social cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into diagnostic labels. Only the off-stage wartime backstory keeps this from full 9-band integration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fiddler’s interiority is vivid—ashes of “never,” the bow-arm curve in the pixelated self-portrait—but the sister-fire motive is told once and never re-engaged under pressure; the final choice feels symbolically right rather than personally inevitable. Micro-choices (using the flake as shim, exposing the plate) are present and embodied, yet the emotional cost is inferred more than dramatized. Still, the contradiction between clinging to story and surrendering to erasure is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s robber-bred calm is embodied in micro-choices—pinning bills to the lion car, walking rivals past chalk arrows—so the trait drives tactics and costs him LoopLine. Interior contradiction surfaces when the same calm lets the app trap users, creating a credible flaw. The final renunciation—marking a straight rail exit—pays off the inherited loop-urge with visible cost, earning the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s lucid-dream agency is concrete and stakes her body—tears dried to salt, voice given to Nera—so the interior contradiction is felt. The promise to “carry part of it in my pages” is a micro-choice that later costs her when she must speak the dead brother’s fear aloud. Only the brother’s trembling-hand cameo edges toward convenient pathos; the rest is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thalen’s “warlike serenity” is embodied in every beat—rowing into the vortex, singing the chant while feeding two seeds to mutual destruction—so the stoic credo is never abstract. The twin’s thawed apology gives him a mirror-self to protect, turning guardedness into active shield-work. Lost-finder trait is more than label: it explains why he alone can descend and why the lake returns its stolen goods to his feet. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where calm cracks—so the arc is less transformation than confirmation, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized—she tracks the rumor, produces the clipping, offers her own blood—but the visionary’s choices are all oracular instruction; because his agency is passive, the relationship crucible never shifts under pressure and the final reunion feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction is dramatized in the bargain she cuts—offering her own pain-amnesia to shield Jory—so the final endurance costs her every dawn. Interiority stays concrete (“yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn”) and the micro-choice to burn the card fully on the tomb lid crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-tagging (“reckless idealist”) early on; once in scene she earns every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—"wrest meaning from it the way I used to wrest a road case" marries muscle memory to grief. The micro-choice to draft the report that recommends a listening station crystallizes the shift from fact-armor to gift-giving. Cost is felt: he forfeits the safety of being right in order to make someone else’s memory real. One hairline slip: the final realization is articulated rather than dramatized, blunting the last ounce of sting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nerin’s guilt-driven precision and analogical habit feel lived-in; the micro-choice to wire the seed rather than chase the light shows a believable renunciation. Interior contradiction—ambition vs. grief—stays active in scene, not summary. The final letting-go lands as earned because the text has dramatized his fingers tightening copper first. Only the sister’s voice-in-memory lacks full embodied differentiation, keeping this just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s trembling neoprene hands and the quiet permission of the final naming give a felt cost, but the interior contradiction between forgotten past and present service is told more than enacted in scene; one more micro-choice under pressure would have pushed it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s shift from bureaucratic certifier to carrier-of-light is legible through embodied micro-choices (taking the pearl, fixing it above the door). The widower’s tremor and pearl-fondling externalize guilt without diagnostic labels. Both characters abandon a path—sealing the hatch, hiding the pearl—at visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicler’s guilt-driven compulsion to re-survey the river is viscerally embodied; the trembling hand on the map and the accordion’s taped bellows externalize self-loathing. The decisive act—photographing the skipped latch and emailing the council—pays off every prior evasion with visible cost. Interior contradiction is sustained: methodical habits war with the need to confess, culminating in the platform lullaby that admits forgiveness is a process, not absolution. Only the brother remains a shade rather than a second on-page pressure source, slightly capping relationship-as-crucible leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lyric yet concrete—"cautious exuberance" recurs as embodied pulse. The swallowed sentences motif externalizes fear without therapy-speak. Final micro-choice—mailing the apology—pays off the sister-name reveal with visible cost: he already risked speech. Flaw: no second character on page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—archival loyalty vs. plant-loyalty—is dramatized in the moment she tips coffee, reads the crown-blotted future, and still chooses theft; the figs’ sap-rise warning gives her fear a body. The renunciation costs her career (blank report, envoy’s threat) and is earned by prior causal beats. Only minor slip: “dream” stays abstract; a single concrete childhood plant memory would crystallize the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—fear of the threshold for others, not herself—drives every tactile micro-choice; the emerald transfer and final release are earned by this rooted motive. Embodied emotion is precise: “hands feel newly alive” against frost, thumb-circles that once “coaxed life into dull hair” now ferry memory into cold tissue. No epiphany is declared; the shift from hoarding to gifting the spark is shown through the final green thread. Cost is visible: she descends “with empty hands,” the borrowed light now irretrievably sky-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—gentle caretaker yet decisive pruner—remains embodied in every micro-choice; the hairpin offering and the choice to assign, not absolve, her brother dramatize a credible shift from seeking contentment to cultivating it, with visible cost. The forgiveness-backstory is kept off-stage, so the “empty space” is asserted rather than dramatized, a minor motivational thinning that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—selling certainty while hoarding doubt—remains vivid and embodied; the moment she drapes the cloak over herself instead of delivering it, her micro-choice visibly reorders her hierarchy of values. The paid-conscience premise could feel schematic, yet her flinch from the eyeless mirror keeps the flaw alive under pressure. Cost is legible: she leaves carrying the weight she was paid to remove, a renunciation that closes the causal arc. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s contradictory condition—aging backward yet losing language—creates a sharp, embodied cost that motivates the transfer of technique. The narrator’s micro-choice to accept the pebble and later the notebook shows a hierarchy of values: curiosity over safety, legacy over ego. The final image of appearing “carrying the truth” crystallizes an earned endurance rather than a tidy change. Minor slip: the narrator’s interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“I understood his final lesson”) rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oren’s centuries-long endurance and reverence for bone-towers are concrete; his refusal to chase grief-laden echoes shows interior contradiction under pressure. The final stillness that lets the pulse enter is a credible renunciation of physical travel, paid for by the dawn-loss of the birdsong map. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays specific to a stone-being’s sensorium. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Davin’s hunger for the sacred is visceral; his choice to climb unarmed and abandon gear crystallizes a credibly flawed, impulsive mage. Interiority stays concrete—“inkless fingers,” “hungry heart”—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the stone) costs him the very proof he came for, earned by prior refusals. Only the “underachieving” tag is asserted, never tested on-page, keeping him a hair shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lamplighter’s private vow to “discover the color of sound” is a vivid, idiosyncratic want that seeds every beat; the underwater vow to “hear without wanting” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays embodied (“notes seemed to brush my eyes with pale green”) and avoids label-speak. The single POV keeps pressure tight; no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only bar to 9+ is that the interior contradiction—truth as shield vs. lens—remains more asserted than dramatized in a second beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s quiet enthusiasm and coin-casting are vividly particular; the contradiction between her calm and the apocalypse outside is embodied in the click of coins and the micro-choice to split the dish. Interiority stays concrete—she “laughs once, small in her helmet”—never sliding into label-speak. The final looped sacrifice is earned: she burns the last fuel to become the signal she was told to send, so the cost is on-page and scaled to the length. Only the engineers remain generic voices, but they function as pressure, not people, so the crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s grief is palpably embodied in every micro-choice—how he palms dust to write a name, how he angles mirrors to wound himself with memory—so the interior contradiction is alive in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the named crystals behind) is earned because each prior naming loosened his own ribs; the cost is the lover’s name still locked in iron behind his teeth. Only the lover remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; the single-POV pressure is sufficient. The heartbreak never slides into diagnostic label-speak; it stays a visceral hollow that dictates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Evin’s “lukewarm” magic and ledger-minded naiveté are shown through concrete micro-choices—counting drips, breathing between counted drops—so his brittle devotion splinters under the steward’s laugh and re-knits in the final bell-swing. Interior contradiction is live: he clings to mechanical cosmic balance yet personifies the sea as “deciding.” The ringing costs him public ridicule and private uncertainty, earning the near-smile of earned stasis. Voice remains idiosyncratic without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory duties—expunge versus humanize—are dramatized in the photograph trail and the final public confession; the boot-print moment crystallizes her shift from complicity to accountability with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak, and the wind-chime silence embodies the repressed memory she must either keep sleeping or let sing. The choice to display her father’s redacted report beside the sapphire label is a micro-choice that reorders her hierarchy of values and forecloses the family lie forever.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—guild-trained logic vs. secret sentiment—are dramatized in the orchard beats: she first clings to rules, then lets the starlings rewrite the ratio while whispering her mother’s jam-jar memory. The final smile at the “impossible freshness” shows earned change with visible cost: she accepts wonder as co-author, not enemy. Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. The -0.3 keeps her out of 9-band because the council’s authority is declared, never embodied; the external stake remains abstract, muting the cost’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight pattern seeker's interiority is concrete—thumb on buckle nicks, muscle-memory counting—but the moment he decides to "preserve trust under pressure" is stated, not dramatized; still, the final act of snapping the buckle back onto his wrist shows cost and earned endurance, satisfying the 9+ test almost fully.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s post-ego-death clarity is viscerally embodied in the breath-sync with the jarred brain; the final co-guardianship renunciation costs him his claim to singular identity, a price legible in the cracked numbness. Interior contradiction pulses throughout—he both wields clarity and feels hollow—driving every micro-choice. The clone body’s shudder under shared attention, not implanted mind, crystallizes the thematic personhood without tidy redemption. Only the Custodians and Council remain symbolic ciphers, blunting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motive—safeguarding messy innovation—drives every beat; the orthogonal method literalizes her vocation. Interiority is concrete (“my hands hovered as if the seed could hear”) and her refusal to sell out costs her the commercial bloom, a visible price. The OrthoGen woman is more foil than crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin, capping the arc just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bram’s contradictory grief-versus-hope impulses stay embodied (trembling pull-cord hand, kneeling to pulp leaves). The final micro-choice—placing the handle on the windowsill—earns its cost through prior tunnel labour and visibly forecloses further nightly ritual, satisfying earned stasis. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, sensory memory (“small giggle…smeared and hollow”) conveys loss. Minor slip: wife and son remain off-page silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid—“dimensionally homesick” is a sharp, embodied ache—but the guardian’s shift from feral sentinel to vulnerable peer happens in a single speech beat; we needed one earlier micro-gesture or withheld hunger to make the wrist-catch moment feel inevitable rather than merciful. Still, the renunciation of escape for shared uncertainty carries a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s “stoically sensitive” mask is embodied in the way her tears “stand at attention,” and the crozier’s re-forging externalizes her refusal of the charter; the moment she admits fear to Jun while still handing over the tool shows a credible micro-choice hierarchy. Interior contradiction is present but stays a little abstract—“obedience felt like a lid on a boiling flask” is evocative yet not dramatized in a specific prior beat, so the final resolve, while earned, lacks the last ounce of visceral cost on her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s vocation and “find the beginning in every ending” motive are concrete from the first paragraph and drive every micro-choice (clamping the fragment, turning the dial, dropping the mast). Interiority stays sensory—smell of ozone, humming bolts—rather than abstract. The only drag is a slight competence aura: she never mis-tunes or doubts, so the final renunciation feels efficient rather than costly. Still, her embodied attention and the sore-hands line keep the arc credibly physical.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s practiced optimism is shown through tactile ritual (double-checking lines, whistling) and undercut by the ache of every gangway goodbye; the final choice to merge timelines is foreshadowed by her need to keep commuters from vanishing alone. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels as permanent transient as the tide”—and the mirrored nod with older-Lina crystallizes cost without sentimentality. The only drag is a hairline slip into diagnostic self-labeling (“her real motivation was…”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradictory drive—measuring wonder to outrun delirium—remains embodied in every micro-choice (threading angles, notebook proofs). The final letting-go is earned: the same rational architect who counted degrees now accepts unquantifiable connection, paying with the collapse of his mnemonic lattice. Interiority stays specific to a mind that thinks in geometry and iron; no stock “grief” labels. Only the father-mother memory splice feels rushed, blunting the full cost of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s curiosity and pedagogical mission are clear, but her interior contradictions stay summary-level; the single dive ascent is the only beat where her body and value hierarchy collide on-page. The grief-wonder braid is asserted, not embodied. Because the decisive cost (rewriting the curriculum) happens off-page, the arc feels foreshortened. Still, her stance crystallizes and the cost is implied in the final image, satisfying the 600-word bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-protection—are alive in every beat: she pockets the aid, sits beside Eli instead of grabbing him, speaks into the phone knowing it may summon her own dead. The final transfer of the photograph to Eli crystallizes her hierarchy of values: another child’s life over her own anaesthetic. Micro-choices carry visible cost (ash-throat, warming aid) and the endurance is earned. No label-speak; interiority stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (counting breaths, ribs “crowded”), her motive to “stand by the unremembered” is repeatedly activated in micro-choices, and the final act of restoring Ken’s log carries visible emotional cost. The interior contradiction between terror and loyalty drives every beat; no stock labels intrude. She earns the ending’s quiet triumph through prior causality, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s ghost-status and heartbeat-counting are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the porcelain shard as “first crack” stress-map gives her a tactile moral compass. Interior contradiction peaks when she stops counting—an earned renunciation that costs her the safety of denial. Lyle’s disembodied voice is less a second character than a mirror, so relationship crucible is waived without penalty. The final stance is credibly flawed: she carries calm won from failure, not resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ilen’s obsession to “translate texture into sound” is embodied in every micro-choice (timing whispers to bird-flock turns, scraping bone floor with his own veins). The final renunciation—setting the diamond, accepting a voice “neither Toma’s nor Ilen’s alone”—carries visible cost and is earned by the prior pattern of feeding the gem without letting it swallow meaning. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the elders’ off-stage decline keeps this from perfect compression.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—scientist’s detachment vs. covert empathy—surface in the arrowhead moment; her decision to plant it is earned by prior tactile unease and Edda’s charge. Jonas’s shift from haunted to willing punch-line is legible through embodied cost (sweat, ordinary weight). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that Mara’s professional bitterness is asserted more than dramatized before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is embodied in every micro-choice—hiding the bow, tapping the shell, knuckle-playing the chained trunk—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is concrete: the father-memory surfaces only as it fuels the final act of arboreal liberation, not as exposition. The only bar to 9 is that the statues remain faceless obstacles; Lio never tests his own belief against a flicker of their possible sentience, so the relationship crucible is empty.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ivo’s “respectfully rebellious” posture is dramatized in every beat—bowing to soldiers while smuggling letters, trading silence for Nela’s guardianship, uncorking weather instead of a gun. Interiority stays concrete (“he understood then that healing did not mean undoing…”) and the final foster promise costs him the safety of neutrality. The only drag is Nela, who functions more as emblem than contradictory pressure; her dialogue is thin and she never threatens his stance. Still, his value hierarchy is legibly re-ordered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s muteness and carpentry are shown through tactile choice—every shave of wood is a micro-decision—so the “quietly persistent” trait is embodied, not labeled. The halo fragment as motive force is slightly abstract; we never learn why silence “ruined his life,” so the emotional cost is inferred rather than felt. Still, the final sung note is a credible renunciation of muteness, earned by the repair act, giving visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s quiet obsession is embodied in micro-gestures (straightening spines by millimeters, plotting triangles on catalog cards) that make her “sanely eccentric” trait credible. The scarf-triggered realization that “stories are relations” lands as a genuine conceptual shift, yet the beat is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, muting the cost. Interior contradiction is present—loneliness vs. custodial impulse—but the final choice to guide patrons remains an extension of her opening stance, so the arc feels more amplification than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mina’s contradictory impulses—clutch the lost dream vs. release it—are dramatized in the final camera turn; the renunciation costs her the silhouette itself, a price felt on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“palette throbbed like a heartbeat”) and avoids label-speak. The micro-choice to photograph absence rather than presence crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible forfeiture, satisfying the 9+ test even though the beat is compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays concrete; the narrator’s fear-of-speech is embodied in the throat-gate image and tracked through micro-choices (offering the hair, naming Altair). The final release feels earned because each beat has tightened the ribbon around the stakes. The locksmith remains a cipher, but his function as catalyst is internally consistent; the real arc is the narrator’s self-key-turn. Cost is visible: the pool swallows the old laughter and the ribbon comes back re-braided—an irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lissa’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. visceral need to taste the mushroom—drives every beat; the final act of ingestion is earned by the decades-long habit of counting that she now breaks, paying the cost of blankness reversed. Emotion is embodied (hands hover in dark water, tongue meets cool cap) without label-speak. The only minor slip: the “kinder” promise is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting the hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—mentoring while retreating—are dramatized in the backwards-walk tic; Mara’s shift from defiant thief to naming herself is embodied in the trembling pen stroke. The cost of reopening the city’s memory is felt when the exile tag falls, proving resilience can be mentored yet still paid for by the child alone.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    The apprentice’s fear-of-gray motive is embodied early and pays off in the sister-healing climax; Soren’s calm pruner persona is consistent yet never tested by contradiction, so he feels more icon than person. Interiority is vivid (“my worry kept stealing blue”) but the decisive choice—drawing fear in the air—arrives as gift rather than earned flaw-confrontation. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (Nela > wonder > self) is legible and the cost (loss of seed, permanent world-weave) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The restorer’s contradictory motives—family guilt vs. vocation of repair—are embodied in the trembling hand and needle; the final choice to break the vow costs the ancestral storm and the hush itself, grounding the dead through his own heartbeat. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. One slip: the ancestor’s instant acceptance feels slightly faster than the accumulated dread warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s guarded kindness and methodical curiosity are shown through tactile map-handling and the refusal to exhibit the erased lives; the final choice to witness rather than seal the chapel feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“air seemed to thicken with unsaid words”) and avoids label-speak. The only gap: no embodied contradiction under peak pressure—her shift to openness is stated more than dramatized in body.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s analytic grief is a vivid through-line, but the interior contradiction promised by the prompt is reported rather than dramatized in real time; no moment shows competing impulses simultaneously. The final renunciation is earned by accumulated imagery, yet the cost feels conceptual, not viscerally embodied. Dee remains an atmospheric voice rather than a pressure source that forces a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s quiet hunger to be heard without commodification is embodied through the tactile act of encoding; the micro-choice to sign the wall with the blossom-in-bolt glyph crystallizes his renunciation with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—gear-click lullaby, soldered wire loops—avoiding label-speak. The ghost’s need for routing rather than resurrection complicates Lio’s own silence, creating simultaneous impulses. One minor slip: “wanted someone to hear him…” is slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by the bolt-plate spark.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s curiosity and quiet defiance are embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the goggles, decoding the diary, pulling the brake—so her final refusal of the promotion feels earned. The diary’s direct address to her is the only overt shortcut, but it is seeded by earlier “warmly inquisitive fingers” and justified by the captain’s off-stage observation. Interior contradiction is present: she both craves ascent and resents being “merely a carrier,” a tension that sharpens when she stops the lift. Cost is visible: she climbs ten flights by stair, literalizing the extra labor her rebellion demands.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “quietly explosive” interiority is dramatized in the decisive telescope drop; the contradiction between calm procedure and reckless gamble is embodied, not labeled. Juno’s absence is kept alive through the brass telescope and the cloud-naming ritual, so the memorial drive motivates every beat. The final whispered name and sealed notebook show earned cost, not sentiment. One slip: the pilot is a mere observer, so status dynamics stay flat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s face-blindness is more than label: it dictates how she reads the coin, paints the sky, and accepts her limit in the final line. The interior contradiction—wanting to preserve yet forced to relinquish—plays out in micro-choices (painting faster, sliding the book back). Cost is visible: she forfeits the book and the tree. Missing 0.3 because the foreman beat is too polite to test her hierarchy of values under real threat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s curiosity is embodied early—talking to instruments, greeting the lantern in six tongues—and drives every beat; the moment he “laughs out loud” because the room finally feels populated shows interior contradiction between loneliness and hunger for discovery. The final sprint to the helm is earned: his micro-choices with hopscotch-coordinates convert obsession into agency and foreclose the safe drift. Cost is present but thin—no tangible loss beyond leaving the known map—so the arc stops just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s want-to-mend drive is concrete from the first paragraph; the father-backstory flash is anchored to the present pick/file choice and tilts her stance. Interiority stays sensory (“saltwood each morning”) rather than diagnostic. The final micro-choice—trading her own picks to forge a new gear—earns the renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the emotional contradiction could be sharper in-scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s promotion to foreman and the collective “we” ringing the bell give visible micro-choices, but interior contradiction is reported (“our fear…fell away”) rather than dramatized in scene. Serren’s altruism is shown through action, yet no character carries a simultaneous opposing impulse that complicates the final ascent. The arc of strangers-become-family is credible, but the cost of that transformation is asserted, not embodied in a single POV beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s grief-rooted vow and her final micro-choices (loosening escapement, offering heartbeat) give a clear, embodied arc; the cracked puppet as proxy for tenderness externalizes her flaw and makes the sacrificial cost legible. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the climactic beat fuses motive, tool, and price in one image. Slight under-show of how the “thousand lifetimes” ambition began keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s refusal to abandon travelers despite the tightening curse is embodied in every near-touch and counted minute; the interior contradiction between self-preservation and moral duty is kept alive in scene, not summary. The final decision to complete the waystones costs something palpable—another splinter of autonomy—and reads as earned. Minor slip: the child-rescue beat is slightly expedient, muting the full cost at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt-driven return and the foam-to-insight beat feel earned; her interior contradiction (“leave a form behind and still fly” vs “abandonment”) is dramatized through the chrysalis handling and patent release. The micro-choice to volunteer the patent rights carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the brother relationship is off-stage, so the emotional stakes lean on summary rather than live relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vendor’s erased identity and hunger for a first word give a coherent spine; interiority is lyrical but stays concrete (“the hollow in me”). Micro-choice—cutting absence with the stylus—earns the self-naming, yet the emotional contradiction under pressure is more asserted than embodied, keeping the arc vivid but not fully visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Safi’s interior contradiction—needing to taste yet fearing touch—drives every beat; the final act of unwrapping his hands crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Micro-choices (spitting fear into sand, kneeling to accept contagion) embody his hierarchy of values. The soldiers’ borrowed grief lands because Safi’s body has already paid the price. One hairline slip: “quiet failures” is abstract summary amid otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown only once—her calm reply to the elevator—then vanishes; no contradictory impulse or embodied cost surfaces. Interiority drifts into choral-administrator shorthand (“she conducted like a librarian of labor”) that tells us role, not psyche. The final image hangs the weight in her satchel as proof, yet the choice feels pre-decided, not wrested from flaw. Still, her night-long agency is concrete and trackable, keeping the score north of mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nira’s contradictory impulses—scientific control versus surrender to inherited dreams—are dramatized in tactile micro-choices (copper helix turns, thumb on crack). The final renunciation of severance for curation is earned; cost is felt in the quaking knees and the decision to descend. Interiority stays concrete, though “synaptic plasticity” flirts with label-speak once. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s prism-mindedness is shown through concrete micro-choices—breathing on ink, aligning breath with shimmer, sowing seeds—so motive stays embodied. The final recognition that his superstition is actually a key gives a credible, earned shift. No interior contradiction is staged in-scene, so the arc flirts with tidy rather than torn, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s interiority is concrete—she “listens with her hands,” carves to match crack-patterns, smiles at bone-felt vibration—so her symphonic need drives every micro-choice. The only slack is the off-page plan to carry silence-music to neighbors; it’s told, not embodied, so the arc’s final cost is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sable’s refusal-to-coach backstory is cleanly cued by the stone and aligns with his public renunciation; the interior contradiction—yearning for beauty while enforcing restraint—plays out in the pawn-to-crescent beat. Exile is felt cost, but the council vote lands off-stage, muting the final personal price. Still, motive steers every micro-choice without label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s pacifist refusal to force the diary open is embodied, costly, and drives every beat; the moment he bows to the clasp crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—“paper-dry scent of smoke and lavender” anchors empathy in sensory specificity, not label-speak. The final micro-choice—swapping the unstable shells—pays off the earlier quarrel with Mara and visibly forecloses blame, earning the quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jun’s olfactory gift and wrapping-paper cartography are vivid, embodied, and repeatedly steer her choices; the final acceptance of service over possession is earned through the bloom ordeal. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where ambition and fear collide in a single breath—so the shift feels slightly smoothed rather than scarred. Still, her sensory signature and the tactile doodles make her an individual, not a type.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s interiority is concrete—she tests the arrow tip on seedlings, chooses to fly by water instead of horizon, and presses the shard into the stone tree at cost. The contradiction between seeking a miracle source and accepting communal resilience is dramatized in the final gesture, not declared. No secondary character on page, so status crucible N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy (seed rights vs. healing hope) is visible and drives the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The investigator’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is concrete in the final sprint to wreck the spiral, but earlier beats show more instrument-reading than micro-choice; interiority is vivid yet stays in professional register, so the turn feels earned but not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s synesthetic perception is vividly embodied and drives every micro-choice; the moment he strikes the bells to “unfetter” Maera’s voice is a concrete, costly act that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—duty to the Guild versus loyalty to wonder—and the final public performance shows earned endurance with the city’s fragile charter as visible cost. Only the Council weeping feels slightly performative; the emotional price is otherwise legible and scaled to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s guilt-driven return and her trembling hand before un casing the flute embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the pilgrim’s quiet accusation crystallizes her flaw and the final shared breath on the reed shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry” avoids label-speak. One hairline slip: “she had feared the flute, and feared herself with it” edges toward self-diagnosis, but the next clause recovers with sensory consequence. Sufficient for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kestrel’s interior contradiction—borrowing selves until her own blurs—remains vivid and embodied; the final self-emptying beat is earned by the prior accumulation of borrowed voices. Micro-choices (fitting the halo fragment, pulling the blank broadside) visibly cost coherence, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Slight under-show of the “ledger” moment keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rook’s “jittery” trait is shown through kinetic motion—boots on scree, hands shaking—rather than label; the pendant refusal is an embodied micro-choice that costs him the safe completion of his last job, so the renunciation is earned. Interior contradiction is present (“wonder vs. routine”) but stays a touch abstract; still, the final chalk question externalizes the flaw and forecloses the courier path with visible social cost. Nera’s absence functions as a secondary pressure that sharpens his longing rather than a separate character, so relationship crucible is waived. Voice-specific perceptual tics (aurora “leaning closer”) keep the interiority idiosyncratic and non-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s shift from needing “plain answers” to accepting an opaque, embodied grief is credibly embodied in micro-choices (naming anger, deciding on the truthful lie). Interiority stays concrete; the final renunciation costs him the comfort of hatred for the car. Lio remains more oracle than person, but his function is not to change, only to witness and transfer pressure. No internal contradiction is staged in scene—anger is declared, not enacted—so the arc approaches but doesn’t fully hit 9-band earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yara’s interior contradiction—clinging to voice yet surrendering it—plays out in embodied beats (pressing the bead, guiding Jun’s fingers). The final renunciation is earned by the loom’s prior stillness and the orchard’s hush. One hairline slip: “wistful” is named, not shown, in the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s quiet determination is embodied in every micro-choice (trading memory for silk, hammering rods underground); the amnesia-cost sequence credibly thins his identity while sharpening resolve. The final refusal to keep the silk shows earned renunciation, though the mother-name blank is named once rather than felt in scene, slightly blunting emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sensory-map-maker POV is vivid and embodied—palms reading oil, tongue tasting coolant—yet the withheld-truth guilt is told more than dramatized until the final log entry. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the brother’s single line of accusation has to carry the entire emotional turn. Still, the micro-choice to amend the log is earned and costs the narrator the last of their cyclic safety, giving the arc credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Noah’s quiet vigilance is embodied in micro-choices—cutting the engine to listen, reading the letter aloud, stacking stones until his fingers bleed—each action revealing a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The interior contradiction between his reticence and sudden need to “protect her quiet courage” is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Final endurance—writing the unsigned note, accepting anonymity—carries visible cost and is earned by the causal chain. Missing 9 only because the off-stage boyhood storm-closet beat is told once and not re-anchored to a present-tense stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-herald persona is vivid and consistent; laughter as embodied weather-making gives a singular edge. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where the need to laugh collides with the cost of being right—so the final promise feels lightly earned. Still, the keeper’s micro-choices (tilting the wick, cutting paper ships) tether prophecy to bodily action, meeting the 9− threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“new heart thudding politely,” “borrowed pulse quicken”); the dyer’s habit of control versus Sairi’s open-handed practice creates a clean contradiction. The final vow lands as credible renunciation because the trail of sun-lit testimonies has already re-weighted his hierarchy of values. Minor slip: “quietly explosive” is used as label twice before it is dramatized in the dye sparks, muting the earliest beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s private hunger for arboreal witness is concrete and embodied; the moment the sextant ticks sorrow out of his own chest we feel the cost. Interiority stays particular—no therapy-speak—and the final refusal to file a report crystallizes a hierarchy of values. The only bar to 9+ is that the contradictory impulse (duty vs. witness) is stated more than it is dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s wound-for-gift trade is vivid and embodied; the moment she recovers her mother’s voice in exchange for wrapping a child crystallizes contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final choice—leaving some borrowed memories unreturned—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marin’s empathetic interiority is concrete—his slowed breathing to absorb strangers’ urgencies—and his decision to shelter Lysa grows directly from the sister-fire trauma, so the renunciation of surface anonymity carries cost. The only drag is the single-paragraph backstory dump; once it’s past, every micro-choice (hiding to listen, stepping out gently, offering mentorship) stays consistent with the established trait hierarchy. Lysa’s panic and guilt are likewise embodied in torn paper and voice tremor, giving the relationship crucible enough heat for the ending’s shared secret to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mina’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is dramatized through concrete sensory choices—wrapping the loaf, tracking bricked doors, kneeling to plant wheat—so interior contradiction and embodied emotion stay on the page. The confession of signing the complaint gives credible moral texture and drives her later guerrilla act, earning the quiet absolution. Micro-choices (breaking the relic loaf, dipping it in tea) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Voice stays individual; no stock therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilian’s meticulous care and private grief are embodied in every micro-action; the whispered promise that stabilises the slide is a credible, costly renunciation. Interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. personal need to remember—drives each beat. The final vow to “measure every fading illusion” crystallises an earned stasis that forecloses emotional retreat. Only the sister memory feels briefly expositional, keeping this just outside the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—steady mask vs. crawling fear—remains embodied and specific; the coat, the belly-crawl, the wax reset all dramatize hierarchy of values. The final choice to trigger chaos rather than warn openly is earned by prior failures and costs her the truce, visible in blood-rinsed boards. No label-speak; competence balanced by genuine struggle. Father stays off-stage, so relationship crucible not tested on page; headcount stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is sensorily rich and character-specific; the taste-listening trick and glow-ink anchor a memorable perceptual signature. Motive pulses steadily—grandmother-shaped absence—until the circle invitation where cost becomes legible through sensory shift (iron→bread) and ring settling. Still, the choice to join is reported more than dramatized; micro-choice under live opposition is missing, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound drudgery vs. the need to “uncork” creativity—are embodied in the charcoal-smeared knuckles that keep moving while she resists. The mnemonic gift is more than label: it drives the lock-picking beat and the final mural, paying a visible cost in soot-stained fatigue. The laugh-soft “once” at the end crystallizes earned stasis: she accepts the vocation her mother hid, foreclosing the safety of anonymity. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapy-speak; only the brief “suppressed creativity” phrase flirts with abstraction, but the next sentence grounds it in ash-taste.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—needing shine to sell sincerity while craving unvarnished truth—drives every beat; the fern’s physical reaction externalizes the flaw without label-speak. The final choice to confront Lio with “one clean question” is earned because her prior micro-choices (trading a truthful line for directions, writing un-gilded paper) have already foreclosed the option of continuing to hide behind gold. Cost is visible: she abandons the craft that pays rent and risks the cistern to regain her brother. Only the brother’s off-page silence keeps this from full 9-band immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysa’s motive—preserve wonder via sound—remains steady; her micro-choices (spinning the wheel faster, retuning) embody it. No interior contradiction is dramatized, so the arc is linear rather than torn. The Auditor’s palm-burn supplies external pressure, but Lysa’s internal stakes never tighten; she wins without paying a visible personal cost. Still, her vocationally specific actions keep her from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    N-3’s caretaker code colliding with the need to burn the roses is dramatized in embodied micro-choices—palming the bead, asking permission with a finger-brush. The contradiction between preservation and destruction drives every beat; the final burial of the cooled bead shows earned cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “fewer ghosts buzzing” is a touch generic, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “discerning curator” eye anchors every beat: she notices the locket’s weight, hears the mailbox clink, chooses not to sell. Interiority stays sensory and job-colored; the final clasping of the locket is a micro-choice that visibly pays the story’s cost. No contradictions, no therapy-speak. Secondary voices are flat but off-stage; single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s calm defiance is embodied through micro-choices—rolling the dice, dancing the cipher—so motive stays legible under pressure. The interior contradiction (vulnerability vs encryption) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation of the journal carries felt cost. Oren’s flicker of recognition supplies relationship crucible without crowding POV. Only the absence of an on-page mistake that compounds keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysa’s grief-driven trespass is visceral and embodied; the lantern-flame bowing to each dot of the chain shows micro-choice under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final re-recognition by her father lands as earned cost because the prior salt-jar theft and beach ritual have foreclosed the “mercy” path. Cap at 8.7 only because the council’s motive is asserted, not dramatized, slightly blunting the moral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motive—hush the prophecy before factions weaponize it—stays legible, and her final choice to filter rather than erase carries cost. Interiority is evocative (“private current inside her”) yet drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“understood why the factions wanted it”) that blurs contradiction in-scene. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices (drawing silence intervals, pressing wing to water) are concrete and value-laden. The endurance of carrying the warning alone is credible, but the absence of embodied fear or second-guess in the decisive beat keeps the arc just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—pressing wax, following cracks—so the motivation stays embodied. Ilyas’s ghost-tutor status is accepted without exposition because the narrator’s calm need aligns with their shared ritual. The final act of slipping documents into the inspector’s folder crystallizes a value hierarchy: heritage over personal safety, cost shown by the landlord’s implied threat. Interior contradiction is light but present: the narrator both relies on and will lose Ilyas, a loss felt when he “faded into the mortar.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go—are dramatized in the copper-lattice scene where she agrees to seal the memory; the final micro-choice to request future access under her own authority shows earned change with visible cost (the shell’s silence). Interiority is concrete (“shell’s silence in her pocket like a completed sentence”), not label-heavy. Brother’s off-stage decision motivates her but never eclipses her on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—complicity vs. absolution—are dramatized in the moment she chooses the key over the quill; the embodied sting of the thorn and the mid-breath shift in rhythm make the interior cost legible. Her father’s unfinished letter and the ledger revelation tighten the chain of motivation so the final act of public confession feels earned rather than symbolic. The only restraint from 9+ is a slight over-articulation of the thematic stake (“to forgive the unfinished”) that momentarily flattens the exquisite micro-choices preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to recover Senn yet fearing his stolen echo—drives every beat; the childhood-name callback at climax proves the motive was alive throughout. The single micro-choice of singing the counter-phrase costs her a literal note of her own voice, paying the price on the page. Senn and Jaro remain functional extensions rather than full crucibles, capping relationship depth.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s vocation and ethic (“salvage something pure”) drive every beat; her careful truth-weaving is dramatized in the globe-alignment and dream-tracking, not merely labeled. Interiority stays concrete—she warms the glass, listens to ghosts as “images pressed against her thoughts”—and the final renunciation (setting the globe in the alcove) costs her the child’s lingering presence, a price felt on the page. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite met, but motive, micro-choice, and embodied emotion remain coherent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jiro’s quiet hunger to “learn why their hands ached” is concrete and embodied; the whisk-as-philosophy moment crystallizes his interior contradiction. Ren’s shift from mockery to bowed gratitude is legible, though his interiority is thinner—his confession feels slightly summarized rather than lived. The final bow with the whisk shows visible cost and earns the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s skeptical-professional lens is vivid and consistent; the choice to mail the ledger pages feels earned because the text has shown him weighing risk vs. exposure. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where his debunker identity collides with the temptation to believe—so the arc is more competent than revelatory. Still, the final apple-in-hand gesture gives a tactile, personal cost that lifts the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s “variant allegiance” is dramatized in every beat—storm-lit puppet shows vs. radio theft—so interior contradiction lives in action, not labels. The final shared broadcast costs him sole ownership of meaning, a renunciation earned by the prior lonely hoarding. Mara remains half-myth, but her presence still pressures Eli’s choices; the relationship crucible is one-sided yet functional. One hairline slip: “he called it variant allegiance” is diagnostic self-tag mid-climax, −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sato’s contradictory hunger for coins versus communal healing is embodied in the tactile jar ritual; the final offer of stories for music dramatizes a visible cost (his cup of names). Interiority stays concrete, though “positively wistful” risks label-speak twice. The arc from scavenger to bridge-builder is earned because each sound-capture beat progressively trades solitude for exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—tide-table logic vs. throat-tight grief—grounds every beat; the fork-strike choice crystallizes his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The trader’s micro-confession is embodied (glassy eye “filled with water that looked like melted ice”) rather than diagnostic. Only the two henchmen remain generic, flattening status dynamics and capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Irena’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into strategic patience—drives every micro-choice; the vow is embodied in nightly moon-charting and the final refusal to sabotage early. Her embodied emotion (“wolf behind a half-opened door”) is specific, never diagnostic. The cost is legible: she returns alone to redraw the horizon, the grain gone, her earlier sprinting self irretrievably shed. Only the rebels remain slightly generic, preventing the final 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific empiricist vs. inherited memory—drives every micro-choice; the lantern-touch flash fuses past and present, forcing the decisive leak. Her “watchfully calm” trait is embodied, not labeled, and the final refusal of Kellan’s order costs her safety while staying credibly within her forensic discipline. The only minor drag: the father’s death is summoned once and never re-embodied, so the emotional extra layer feels asserted, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—preaching repentance yet doubting his own counsel—drives every beat; the moment he chooses Lena’s plan over institutional safety crystallizes cost. Darren remains off-page, so the chaplain’s shaken palms and “ache like an old fracture” must carry the relational pressure; they do. The final micro-choice—walking back under clearing skies—earns a quiet stasis that forecloses the old certainty. Only the robbed woman’s nod feels slightly under-weighted, keeping it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “steadily curious” trait is dramatized—she reads warning labels for plot, bows to waves, invents sounds—so motive stays concrete. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both mocks destiny and obeys the algorithm, culminating in the choice to socket the arrow and ring the silent bell; the cost (accepting she is now the unheard bell’s “clapper”) is legible. One hairline slip: the final grin feels slightly performed after such weight, keeping her just shy of a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory motives—obedience to policy vs hunger for truth—drive every micro-choice; the final lie is earned by the breadcrumb trail of numbers and costs her the safety of corporate anonymity. Interiority is concrete (“listen for what the database refuses to say”), never label-speak. The mother reveal reframes prior obsession without tidy healing, keeping flaw intact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s “shadow-laced” nature is never embodied; her interiority stays abstract (“felt an argument…before any voice rose”). The climactic choice to stitch the ball and split the men’s duties is causally sound, but the cost is social, not personal—she never risks or loses anything on the page. The mirrored glimpses of dread/shame are vivid, yet Mara herself remains a calm conduit rather than a contradiction in motion. Still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible and drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s obsession with “the sound of approaching endings” is embodied in the bone-tip taps and the midnight crawl to free the skiff; contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—co-exist in scene. The renunciation Signe demands lands as earned stasis: he foregoes further voyeuristic pursuit and accepts the fold in patience, cost visible in the final image of sled receding into wind. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: the grandmother fire memory is summoned twice in similar language, slightly diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sentinel’s quiet, vine-wise stoicism is vividly embodied; his gentle persuasion credibly bends the night’s encounter without slipping into sage cliché. Mara’s translator restlessness is sketched through gesture and letter-ash rather than label, and her choice to keep the unread pages feels earned. Both voices stay distinct in dialogue, and the shared burn-line comparison gives a micro-choice that tilts their mutual stance. Interior contradiction is present yet lightly handled—could have carried one more beat of self-interested impulse to hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iri’s peripheral awareness, masked honesty, and balancing vocation are concrete and embodied; her micro-choice to offer the dawn ritual and her shared tear with the prophet crystallize a credible renunciation of ownership over wisdom. Interior contradiction is present but stays slightly cerebral—no visceral flaw that risks failure. The final quiet accord lands as earned stasis with visible cost: she accepts perpetual secrecy. Still, the prophet’s motivation is sketched more than dramatized, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s calm perceptiveness is shown through concrete micro-choices—aligning photos by arcs, asking for diagonals vs curves—which drive every beat; the interior contradiction between private grief and public curatorial composure remains mostly told rather than embodied, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scholar’s reticence is shown through marginal voice and pocketed crystal, but the interior contradiction—desire to decode vs. fear of blame—stays summary; the final plea is credible yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied, so the arc lands slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her fear of her mother’s silence, her tactile use of chalk as anchor—and every micro-choice (pressing record, speaking the name) is embodied and stakes-laden. Orrin’s precognitive forgetfulness is dramatized through the looping dialogue and chalk circles, not merely labeled. The final shared breath recorded is a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses the option of ever retrieving these exact voices again. Only the mother remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is not fully tested on the page, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—trust in images vs. need to re-engineer time—drives every micro-choice; the leaf-tick governor literalizes her father’s creed and costs her the last clean launch window, so the Earned Stasis lands with felt price. Competence is balanced by the quake she can’t stop and the pilot she couldn’t save; memory of Lio injects loss without explanatory filler. No label-speak; body and tool knowledge stay concrete, tactile, and specific to her.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s calm, choice-driven agency is vivid—her decision to call Jonah, to tape the shard, to keep singing—each micro-choice costs her professional detachment and is rooted in her “decisively kind” trait. Elias’s want/need (forgiveness vs. pride) is embodied in the broken vinyl and the cracked breath he times to the warped chorus. The father-son hand-clasp reconfigures their six-year silence with visible cost: Elias’s final exhale, Jonah’s tremor. Interior contradiction is present—Mara’s serenity wavers when she “hears the pulsing stillness”—but the piece stays in lyrical register, not full scene-level interior clash, keeping it just under 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s quietly deliberate pace and ink-stained fingers are concrete; her need to “relearn” by closing loops turns every micro-choice into a test of inherited discipline. The moment she dips her finger into the white pool, the embodied cost of rejoining her own shadow is legible and irreversible. Interior contradiction is present—curiosity against inherited dread—yet the mentor’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage, capping the crucible at 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rowan’s interior contradiction—scientific skeptic vs. reluctant caretaker of folklore—drives every micro-choice; the moment he sets the changeling’s jaw, the trait and the cost fuse. The “forgiving skeptic” label is shown, not told, through his refusal to shame grief and his tactile diagnosis of the girl. One minor slip: the phrase “yearning steadied into work” edges toward abstraction, blunting the embodied beat that otherwise crystallizes his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s guilt-anchored refusal of fire and his micro-choice to breathe apology into the pearl give a credible, embodied arc; the final shared ritual shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“weighed that guilt… palm to palm”) and avoids label-speak. One minor slip: the grown child’s single whispered line is too tidy a mirror, blunting contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction pulses throughout: shame vs. need to repair, hiding vs. exposure. The amber hand-off crystallizes a hierarchy of values—guilt, memory, future agency—paid for with the last protected object. Micro-choices (hood up, slow step from vines, pressing pendant to foil) embody cost without exposition. One hairline slip: “protected vulnerability” is named, not dramatized, in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory drives—contracted optimism vs. obsession with darker truth—are embodied in every beat: she literally steps into her own manuscript to harvest unpretty hope. The micro-choice to open the wet book against its will crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the safety of a tidy ending. Interiority stays concrete (“manuscript tightened like a fist around her throat”), never drifting into label-speak. Only the baker-cameo feels slightly external, keeping her from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marn’s interiority is vivid—his imagining the vine as “a living wire” is concrete and particular—but the emotional contradiction demanded for 9+ never surfaces; he proceeds with serene confidence and encounters no internal resistance. The final “smiling” exit feels unearned because no flaw or cost is registered inside him. The keepers’ shame is asserted, not dramatized, so the relationship crucible remains inert. Still, his embodied tinkering choices do advance the rite, satisfying the basic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eira’s embodied patience and micro-choices (bending knees, matching orchard cadence) make interiority concrete; the heartbeat-map motive is consistent and drives every beat. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she moves from patience to sealing without an on-page moment where doubt or alternative desire collides with the goal—so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Still, the final renunciation (binding the map to the well, foregoing personal escape) carries visible cost under the Accumulative lens and is earned by her prior ritual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivo’s reflective, peripheral nature is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—turning the timer in his palms, shaving marble at dawn—so the trait alters tactics, not merely decorates. Interiority stays concrete (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) and is tested by cavern pressure; the final endurance costs him solitude and sonic cargo. The only bar to 9 is that the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible mistake that compounds; he succeeds too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    The weaver’s interior contradiction—wanting to carry others’ grief yet fearing empty hands—grounds every beat; the embodied moment when soot blackens his palms crystallizes the flaw and its cost, earning the closure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miriam’s grief-logic is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (carving, oiling, timing the kettle) externalizes her contradictory need to keep Jory present while letting him go. The “hauntingly practical” trait is not a label but a working method that costs her sweat and splinters. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; interior arc alone earns the high band, though the final renunciation is slightly under-costed—her hands open, but we don’t yet feel what she forfeits beyond the panel itself.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—scavenger patience vs. savior urge—surface in the bolt-fixing micro-choice; the renunciation of “running circles” is earned and costs her the stored images. Interiority stays embodied (“dry taste”) and avoids label-speak. Ghost-as-mirror pressures her in-scene, satisfying crucible demand. Missing second on-page character keeps relationship bullet dormant; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s “functionally creative” trait is shown, not told: she turns cracked tile into drainage algebra, rigs gutters to prime a pump, reads people-flow as hydraulic logic. Interiority stays concrete and occupational—she weighs flow rates, not feelings—so when her hands shake from cold the moment lands harder. The final renunciation (approving demolition is no longer imaginable) is earned because every micro-choice has tied her identity to resurrecting the maze. Only the stoic mask feels asserted rather than revealed, keeping her just shy of full contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scribe’s contradictory hunger for sound and self-punishing silence is embodied in micro-choices—tearing the ledger, wrapping the paw—each a tactile refusal of his former vow. The final renunciation (“I could bear the longing honestly”) is earned by these prior acts and carries visible cost: the bell dream is relinquished on the page. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; even the epiphany is delivered as physical warmth soaking through wool. The bear functions as pressure, not symbol, forcing the hierarchy of values to shift in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—serene posture vs. shaking calm—grounds every move; the sundial micro-choice at the climax visibly pays the cost of exposing her own cargo-culture complicity. The bargeman’s late confession adds credible pressure, but because he enters after the decisive splice, relationship-as-crucible weight is limited at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s “infinitely patient” stance is dramatized through the slow decoding of knots and the refusal to plant the black lotus; the clerk’s shaken recognition supplies external proof of internal cost. Interiority stays concrete—fulgurite lens, salt-stiff rope—never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the final acceptance of public teaching is reported rather than shown in a micro-choice that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation (“write obituaries for the living”) gives a sharp motive that drives every beat; the queen’s single concrete memory (ear-to-soil) crystallizes her grief and authorizes the projection. Interiority stays embodied—notebook, thread, shawl—avoiding label-speak. The final micro-choice—accepting the thread as compass—pays the cost of carrying her sorrow forward, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lorian’s exhausted refusal of machine-joy and his tactile tenderness toward the egg are vivid; the final choice to leave the Cradle unguarded crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Interiority sometimes drifts into abstract “hypothesizing” loops that mute contradictory impulse in-scene. Still, the embodied tremor when pigment coats brass cheeks keeps contradiction alive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—inheritance of fire-setting blood vs. life-saving vocation—are dramatized in the shack rescue where she sees her father in the boy yet re-enters anyway. Micro-choices (coin swing for breath-timing, field graft) embody “unyielding compassion” under literal fire. The final coin-swap shows earned change: she externalizes the talisman into a message, accepting public scrutiny rather than private talismanic protection—cost is the surrender of anonymity. Voice stays concrete; only minor over-articulation (“prove that scars can sing”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—scientific doubt versus empathetic compulsion—are dramatized in the moment she stops forcing the latch and listens; the final choice to carry the light back is earned by the revealed maternal connection and costs her the shelter of forgetting. Interiority is concrete, body-bound (“box warm with her light”), and avoids label-speak. One decimal off 8.8 only because the mother reveal is a single beat; we don’t see the prior relationship under pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lior’s exile motive and pocket-gear obsession are concrete early; the refusal to repeat parental paths drives every micro-choice (knot-tightening, moth-harness, final decision to stay on the outskirts). Interior contradiction—yearning for light yet fearing replication—remains embodied, not abstract. The caretaker exchange crystallizes cost: handing over the gear dims his personal beacon but seeds collective possibility, a renunciation legibly paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jonas’s interiority is textured through limestone-stained hands and the private “throb” of his question, but the spectral father’s instruction bypasses his own contradiction; the final communal braiding is moving yet feels guided rather than wrested from inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt-driven precision and her father-/Torren-haunted memory feel lived-in; the micro-choice to lift the bob, feel corrosion fall, and align the rake-handle scratch shows contradictory duty vs shame in one motion. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation (carrying lead and handle to the widow) costs her the last illusion of quick forgiveness. The only bar to 9 is that the ethical diligence trait is asserted more than tested in a second beat; we see her obey Torren’s map but not a moment where that diligence collides with a live temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Gardener’s “blithe” label is asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Interiority drifts into generic lament (“joy is easier to carry”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values. The final planting of the ash reads as symbolic duty, not a choice that costs him anything personally.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jora’s interior contradiction—distrust of prophecy yet hunger to guide—drives every micro-choice; the vow born of her father’s fatal certainty anchors her refusal to obey the Warden and is paid for by the one-page compression itself. The kingfisher quill, pocketed “bones” of data, and conditional syntax all externalize her hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is felt when she trades the safety of authoritative certainty for the vulnerability of inviting revision. The only bar to 9+ is that the Warden’s pressure, though present, stays largely verbal; a sharper status shift on-page would have crystallized the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s copying obsession and vow to “teach dust to tell stories” give her a sharp, idiosyncratic drive that escalates to public risk. Interiority stays concrete—ink glowing after midnight, dust “wanting to listen”—but the final leap from clandestine scribe to open-air insurgent feels one beat under-motivated; we don’t see the micro-choice that burns her retreat bridge. Still, her flawed perseverance carries the thematic weight with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—self-protection vs. offering witnesses to grief—are alive in every beat; the ash-handling micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (father-memory vs. survival). The final softening of the inspector is foreshadowed by her own masked breath, so the crystallized emotion lands as earned cost. Only the inspector’s turn feels fractionally convenient; a hair more setup would remove the tiny wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orin’s “abrasive calm” and rational rebellion are vividly embodied in how he barters slate notes for an auger and later refuses Mara’s meal ticket—micro-choices that cost him comfort and safety. The dead navigator’s lantern-light memory is a sharp, embodied trigger for his obsession, and the final refusal lands as earned endurance rather than preachy heroism. Interiority stays concrete: the auger’s click “travels up the shaft into his teeth,” marrying sensation to motive. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “competing narratives” that edges toward thesis-speak, blunting the contradiction that should live in his gut.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—her “expectant resignation”—is dramatized in the first paragraph through the tactile cue of the cracked rosette, anchoring motive. The micro-choice to “subtract noise” by writing each singer’s sacrifice on the chalkboard externalizes her braid-until-it-tears ethic and visibly raises the cost of failure. The final quiet that “sits… like a verdict” crystallizes her stance without epiphany overload. One hairline slip: the father-church flashback is told, not braided into present pressure, so the unlearning feels asserted rather than embodied in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—gentle caretaker vs. clandestine insurgent—are dramatized in every pruning cut and tasting beat; the final choice to share rather than weaponize the fruit is earned by the remembered flavor of the botanist’s regret. Interiority stays concrete (“warm as a heartbeat”) and never drifts into label-speak. The cost is visible: she gives away the last fruit and shapes the tree into an open canopy, forfeiting future leverage. The only bar to 9.0 is that the neighbors remain off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is implied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maro’s involuntary truth-telling is more label than lived; the climactic confession lists facts rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses under fire. Still, his desire to “preserve wonder” is embodied when he pockets the box instead of filing it, and the final toll-booth legend shows earned change. The moment he names Sela’s greed aloud is crisp, but interiority elsewhere slips into synopsis. Enough cost is on the page to clear the 9− gate, yet the peak beat could carry more embodied shame or tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—testing the clock move, weighing the hush-shard—that escalate to the climactic communal re-placing; the final renunciation on the tideline costs her the private tool, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the coworkers’ tease is told, not dramatized, so the social stakes of her odd gift remain off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilyan’s guilt-driven descent and the Founder’s stone-locked vigil are both embodied through tactile micro-choices (threading cord, dissolving wax). The final renunciation—accepting nuance over certainty—carries visible cost as he rises “with the ampoule’s message,” voice now freighted with complicity. Interior contradiction is alive in every beat; no therapeutic self-labeling intrudes. The only bar to 9.0 is that the Founder’s centuries of loneliness are told more than dramatized, slightly diluting the shared cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “grim optimist” is vividly embodied—notebook against ribs, sore calves, dice roll as theorem—showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation (refusing to imagine a better landing) is earned by the prior proof-lemma chain and visibly costs him the wheel’s hum and the staircase’s promise. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the Mara memory remains a touch under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait drive every micro-choice; the brush gift and Ro’s arrival are credibly motivated by prior kindnesses. Interiority stays concrete (“chest hurt,” “shoulders rose”) and contradictory impulses (hope vs. survival) coexist in-scene. The final “rouse” is earned because the alphabet experiment visibly costs her sleep and safety. Only the grandmother-memory transfer feels slightly too convenient, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris’s bread-custom and lens-use give concrete, character-specific action; her dread is palpable. Yet interiority sometimes drifts into curatorial labels (“sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour”) that feel authored, not lived. The final offer of the captain’s initial loaf crystallizes her values, but the beat is narrated rather than embodied in gesture or dialogue. Still, her choices drive every turn, cost is felt, and contradiction (hope vs. evacuation dread) stays active.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orin’s grief-driven obsession is sharply embodied in brass-and-salt imagery and micro-choices (winding the yoyo backward, surrendering the rescue). The renunciation is credible, but the sister remains off-stage; no relationship crucible or status pressure is tested on-page, so the arc is solitary and the interior contradiction is pronounced yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction pulses in every beat: the narrator both courts and dreads the glow, clings to yet distrusts the advisor, presses the swan until it draws blood. Embodied emotion is vivid—"lungs tasted of pennywater," "heartbeat matched its flicker"—and the final micro-choice (twisting the clasp to drink the light) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: annihilation of the image over self-preservation. The only bar to 9 is a hairline excess of diagnostic self-labeling ("photographically cursed") that slightly cools the immediacy of peak fear.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Leeward’s “translate disaster into music” drive is concrete and embodied; every tap of the mallet is a micro-choice that alters crew tactics. Interiority stays sensory—salt pears, bell-buoy clang—never sliding into label-speak. The final tar-repair of the mallet shows cost scaled to length, earning a credible endurance rather than epiphany. What keeps the score sub-9 is the absence of a contradictory impulse tested in scene; risk is externalized, so the arc is steady rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—her eyes “always straying,” the stylus tapped in whistle-rhythm—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a moment where we feel her fear overrule her curiosity. The final step through the gate is causally earned yet emotionally cost-free; no micro-choice shows her relinquishing safety or belief. Still, the pattern-language mapping gives her a concrete, idiosyncratic competence that lifts her above cipher status.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—comfort in the lie versus anger in the throat—grounds every beat; the bargain she offers crystallizes her hierarchy of values (truth without shaming vs. civic peace) with visible cost to both. Hadrin’s micro-shift from protector to confessing editor is credible because we watch the gold hawk judge him. The only minor slip is “emotional ventriloquism” in the phrase “grief weaponized,” which momentarily sounds like the author explaining. Otherwise motives, flaws, and status play cleanly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—rule-bound surveyor vs. clandestine archivist—are dramatized in every beat: she measures, then secretly writes; she placates the council, then wrests the hook. The inkwell as maternal relic anchors motive without exposition, and the final stone she sets herself crystallizes a hierarchy of values (memory over career) with felt cost. Only the skiff fight feels slightly convenient; Beran’s sudden appearance is the single unmotivated spike that keeps her from a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s calm indexer-brain is vividly embodied (“readjusted my gloves, steadied my breathing”) and her solitary choice carries cost. The interior contradiction—seeking truth while preparing to conceal it—peaks when she leaves the stamp behind. Micro-choices (photographing cards, restoring cabinet) align with motive, though the swim-out beat could show slightly more bodily strain to nail earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s grief is embodied in the origami cranes and the lantern she re-tools; her choice to “leave part of herself in the light” is a costly, irreversible act that forecloses her old life. The interior contradiction—wanting Jalen back yet knowing the price is self-dispossession—plays out in the climactic folding scene. One decimal off 8.8 only because the brother’s laughter is named, not shown, so the emotional baseline is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Survivor’s trauma-driven refusal to look away powers every beat; embodied grief in cracked glass & geode handling keeps interiority concrete. Micro-choices—manual thruster bursts, feeding the pool into the net—show hierarchy of values: memory > safety > mercy. Cost is felt when he seizes the “hinge” of a live branch he cannot enter; renunciation lands clean. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; contradiction between vengeance and mercy stays tacit and active.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “perpetually surprised” face is shown, not told, through her repeated startle at small discoveries; the pilgrim’s motive—decoding a radio whisper of “belonging”—drives every offer and step. Both remain consistent, but the emotional cost is only lightly sketched: Mara packs up “staying perpetually surprised,” a charming yet low-stakes coda. Interior contradiction is present—curiosity vs. caution—yet never forces a painful trade-off on her side. Closure still reconfigures their joint stance, so the arc lands, just without a bruise.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s guilt is embodied in the watch hand and her silence; the micro-choice to place it on the rail and confess earns the shift from eraser to witness. Jonah’s decision to leave the capsule unopened is credibly motivated by the ticking dream and the live confrontation with Mara. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the shared quiet at the end shows visible cost. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory summary just before the rail moment that slightly blunts the emotional spike.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—trading bodies to “recycle mistakes” yet clutching a handle that once opened a home drawer—grounds every micro-choice. The drawer-pull gift to the scarred boy crystallizes her value hierarchy on the page with visible cost (she relinquishes her sole talisman). Status shifts between Sarin and Vek are legible in gesture and silence, but the boy’s near-silent presence limits relationship crucible pressure. No genuine struggle flaws; competence is balanced by the wire-cutting moment’s physical delicacy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theo’s guilt-earned paralysis and micro-choices (poles, compass, logbook) track cleanly; the final renunciation carries felt cost. Interiority sometimes drifts into tidy self-explanation (“he realized he did not need the sea to absolve him”) that momentarily flattens contradiction. Still, contradictory impulses (flee vs. face, shame vs. service) stay active in-scene enough to earn the 8-band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—needing wonder while denying regret—remains vivid and embodied; the baseball counter-weight rescue crystallizes a micro-choice that tilts empathy. The final refusal of the wallet shows credible, scaled change. One hairline slip: “empty chest” drifts toward label-speak amid otherwise concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s grief-steadiness and willingness to pay an unnamed price are rendered through embodied spice-breath and the hound-press; the metamorphosis choice is earned. Yet the interior contradiction between clinging to human duty and surrendering to beasthood is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, keeping her short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is vivid—her bargain with the ceiling, the ribbon tether, the choice to relive rather than flee—but the daughter remains a passive bundle; no contradictory maternal impulse is dramatized on the page, so the arc flirts with monovalent resolve rather than crucible-tested change.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—refusing weapons, sewing photos instead of using AI, naming her cruelties aloud—so the trait drives the final push. The interior contradiction between guilt and compassion is kept active in scene, not summarized. The only bar to 9 is that Lio’s single spoken question feels slightly engineered to let her articulate the vow she has already lived.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amina's contradiction—giving away what she lacks—remains abstract; the "hush" is heard but never costs her a visible micro-choice. The final moment of shared transformation lands because the lava-steam image externalizes the price, yet prior beats summarize rather than dramatize her stakes. Interiority is lush but loops into self-paraphrase ("Coincidences take care of me...") without fresh friction. Still, her refusal to grab the rope and the concomitant shift in Toma feel credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sentinel’s “calmly inventive” trait is embodied in every beat—rewiring locks, carving scratches, misdirecting Orven—so motive stays legible and intensifies. Interior contradiction is present but thin: we hear no simultaneous fear or guilt to complicate the triumph. Because the final renunciation (public neutrality) is earned by the causal chain of micro-choices, the arc satisfies, yet the absence of a counter-impulse keeps it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eren’s guilt-driven vigil and final choice to teach rather than flee are credibly rooted in Lysa’s death and the vial promise; the precognitive curse shapes every evasion and rock placement, giving visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—harness rope tightening as guilt, dust map as memory—without diagnostic labels. The renunciation lands as earned stasis: he keeps the vial and starts a new sequence, foreclosing perpetual flight. Micro-choices (shifting one rock to avert an eel’s death) show hierarchy of values in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s contradictory drives—rage at censorship versus gratitude for his father’s betrayal—are dramatized in the stalled exposure plate; the micro-choice to time, not photograph, scars crystallizes his renunciation of louder protest and costs him the clean moral high ground. Interiority stays embodied (“anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil, like rain that falls straight down”). The final stance—measured light instead of shouted poems—is earned through the timed-plate ritual and carries visible cost (the half-caught star as wound). Capped at 8.7 because the father’s off-page confession is delivered via envelope rather than dramatized choice, slightly blunting motivational torque.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s “diplomatically fierce” credo is dramatized in the duel: courteous phrasing while blade and brass arm close lethal space. Micro-choices—needle card as protractor, footwork tracing anthem angles—show his mind turning questions into destinations under fire. Interior contradiction is light (no moment where he doubts the worth of exposing the map), so motivation, though consistent, stops just short of the layered pressure that would push this to 9+. Cost is visible: Veller pinned, council swayed, exile begun—but the price lands more on the city than on Lysander himself.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Len’s contradictory drives—anarchic planter vs. fragile poet—are dramatized in the coffee-tin micro-choices; the monthly personality molt is asserted more than embodied, but the final renunciation of burning the pamphlets carries visible cost, earning a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s grief-rooted refusal to discard the broken clock is embodied every time he carries it bench-to-bench; the final chord he dares is earned because the film-reel “map” forces him to rehearse goodbye until the clock hands actually advance. Interiority stays concrete—rhythmic pattern recognition instead of therapeutic labels—and the cost of releasing the loop is felt when the compasses steady and the first night ship arrives. The only minor slack is the off-stage courier who delivers the plot catalyst without exerting personal pressure on Lio.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tavo’s interior contradiction—doubt versus duty—remains vivid and embodied; the surrender of his “breath” to the seed is a micro-choice that costs him certainty. The arc lands in credible renunciation: he accepts that proof is communal, not ledger-bound. Yet the absence of on-stage secondary characters limits relationship-as-crucible, capping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—blaming the father while the compass points inward—grounds the arc; the single twig-pruning act crystallizes renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (salt wind rifling hair, cold coin) stays specific. Silence-as-flaw is credibly maintained until the self-indictment on the deck. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; Sera functions as oracle, not crucible, keeping score just below 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her scientific lens (“preprocess reality into clean signals”) directly shapes her actions and emotional arc. Her micro-choices (sweeping the table, scattering dust, photographing patterns) reveal a hierarchy of values: measurement over sentiment, yet she’s humbled when data becomes story. The contradiction between her desire to “strip needless drama” and her growing attunement to organic irregularity feels earned, not performative. Lupe’s bruised knees and collaborative presence apply gentle relational pressure that shifts Mara’s stance without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—singed hair, frost-read footprints, charcoal-rubbed ledger—and their “steadily adaptive” trait manifests in tangible micro-choices: melting failures into sand, building a furnace in the canyon, embedding truth in glass. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve, artistry vs. justice) operate simultaneously without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—choosing testament over vengeance—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: enduring threat to make unerasable truth.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orren’s motivation—translating silence into music—is rooted in trauma and expressed through precise physicality. His internal conflict (loss vs. creation) manifests in micro-choices: pressing the fork to his wrist, steadying the child. Mara’s silent communication reveals complementary agency without overshadowing Orren. The empty tuning fork slot evolves from absence to purpose, embodying earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marek’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “inadvertent stubbornness” manifests in tactile micro-choices (carrying the lens, patching his suit with burial linen) that escalate under pressure. His emotional state degrades believably (ears bleeding, suit seams whispering), and his final endurance carries visible cost. The catalog card in his own handwriting deepens internal conflict without exposition. His flaws actively complicate resolution rather than merely flavoring it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Amira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her fear, care, and strategic silence emerge through micro-choices like ringing the bell softly or pairing elders with youth. Her contradictions (public restraint vs. private resolve) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of naming donors is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in tactile detail like counting bills “by touch.”

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling hands, salt-tongue memory, and unopened-letter chest convey grief without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (placing the tear in the pinhole, choosing to exhale fully) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: releasing love means relinquishing control over its fate. The pilgrim functions not as a plot device but as a catalytic mirror, his presence forcing Mara to confront her spiritual curiosity as both gift and burden. Final renunciation—blessing the soldier’s leaving—is earned by prior causality and carries the quiet weight of irreversible emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to discover the “texture of time”—is embodied through tactile choices (planting hedges in hyperbolic geometry, handling the halo fragment) and contradicted by their instinct to preserve fading photographs. Their internal conflict between preservation and release climaxes in a credible renunciation that forecloses memory with visible cost: the disintegration of the photos and the woman. Lio’s retrocognitive entrapment functions as both mirror and pressure, his silent naming and sudden cry crystallizing the stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is crystalline—“to plant resilience in dry soil”—and embodied through micro-choices: threading the arrow, re-arranging keys to mislead, letting a boy touch her chain. Her internal contradiction (freedom vs. burden) manifests physically and tactically, never abstractly. The chain functions as both flaw and tool, shaping decisions with visible cost. Final endurance—carrying drums while trembling yet steady—earns Charged Poise without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s synesthetic perception, grief, and moral ambiguity cohere into a singular, embodied interiority. Her micro-choices—diving for silence, embedding Jory’s brass, fitting the aid on Rell—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The confession scene shows contradictory impulses (justice vs. closure) acting simultaneously, not summarized. Final renunciation—forging new aids instead of vengeance—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—thief yet revealer, observer yet participant—are embodied in tactile choices (tearing the portrait, carrying moonbeams) and crystallize in the climactic renunciation. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief and hope are filtered through professional obsession (“stole golden-hour portraits… to reveal thin threads of choice”). The cost of his final act—losing his craft’s core method—is felt without melodrama. Nema and “you” apply immediate, coded pressure that forces stance shifts, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, theatrical narration as grief-management, and moral reckoning with past obedience feel specific and lived-in. Her contradictory impulses (desire for safety vs. need for inquiry) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final choice to build glass rooms is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost: the silence she “carried” now thawed through action. No diagnostic label-speak; even her epiphany (“thawing heart… steady decision”) arises from tactile work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling, adaptive training, and fear-as-compass feel specific and contradictory without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (rubbing charcoal, showing tears) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The boy’s presence forces relational stakes that crystallize her transformation credibly. Final action—signing her real name—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cartographer’s obsession is embodied through trembling hands, stolen tools, and sensory degradation under stress, avoiding diagnostic labels. Lyr functions as a crucible: her silence and ritual force the protagonist into micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values—navigation over preservation, silence over speech. His final act of mapping absence is earned by prior causality (the ruined booklet, the pebble spiral) and carries visible cost: the loss of external orientation in favor of internal compass. No safety-hedging; his flaw (measuring the immeasurable) directly enables his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    J-17’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—its longing via cold in grippers, its “amalgamate” process as emotional archaeology—and its final renunciation of the violin is earned through escalating micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over control, witness over repetition. The flaw lies only in the near-absence of contradictory impulses; its composure borders on preternatural, slightly muting the tension between programmed function and emergent desire. Yet the cost is legible: it sacrifices infinite loops to preserve a single, fragile timeline. This restraint feels less like a flaw than a calibrated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied hesitation and micro-choices—her silence, her handling of the lens, her copying of doodles—all revealing a hierarchy of loyalty over protocol. Eli’s presence sharpens status dynamics without dialogue; their mutual suspicion crystallizes into trust via shared risk. The final ledger-signing enacts Earned Stasis: transparency as renunciation of protective secrecy, with visible social cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and mistrust manifest through tactile behavior, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his pragmatism, shame, and quiet ritualism cohere through micro-choices like polishing marbles or replanting cuttings at night. His contradictory impulses (truth vs. survival, secrecy vs. confession) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—confessing to the hedges, not the Bureau—feels earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. Mera functions effectively as a secondary pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her mechanical warmth, professional restraint, and quiet urgency shape every choice. Her contradiction (obliging yet decisive) manifests in scene: she acts without debate but demands agency over the wind rigs. The final renunciation—refusing Sen’s grand theory for station integrity—is earned by her established ethos and carries visible cost: she accepts responsibility for sideways time as a “toolbox,” not a revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s motivation—driven by silence, grief, and artistic fidelity—is embodied through precise micro-choices: tapping the violin instead of bowing, waiting in gaps, interpreting water-stains as scores. Her internal contradiction (fear vs. reverence for Varga’s ghost) manifests physically without therapy-speak. The final act of arranging lanterns and guiding musicians enacts a renunciation of traditional performance with visible cost: she redefines her role from soloist to conduit. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her arc is tightly bound to sensory perception and musical discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s guilt, self-deception, and bodily distress are rendered with visceral specificity; Mara’s peripherally aware presence exerts quiet pressure that forces micro-choices (e.g., the smudged notebook entry). The protagonist’s lie about wind conditions stems from a tragically human impulse to bargain with nature, and his eventual confession is not absolution but recalibration—consistent with his flawed agency. Mara avoids oracle clichés by acting through restraint and textual intervention rather than prophecy. Eli’s return alive but furious deepens the emotional cost without neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s confession and the narrator’s recklessness/skepticism form a compelling interior contradiction that drives micro-choices (e.g., turning the wheel, calling Mara). The final renunciation—choosing truth over silence—is earned through prior causality and carries relational cost. Embodied perception (“eyelids click,” “drowsy alertness”) avoids diagnostic labels. Flaws feel lived-in, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—his loose grip on reality manifests in tactile choices (tracing the swan, refusing to write) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His renunciation of recording at the refuge (“I would write nothing except the way the river kept moving”) is a credible endurance that forecloses intervention with quiet cost. The other keeper mirrors but doesn’t duplicate his stance, deepening the thematic crucible without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through sensory decay and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, caution, and hope manifest through micro-choices (offering instruments, opening the locket) rather than exposition. Mara’s silence feels authentic, not symbolic, and her tentative hum emerges from accumulated trust, not plot convenience. The locket isn’t a prop but a lived extension of Liora’s motive, and her “cautious exuberance” shapes every interaction without being named as such. Both characters avoid therapeutic clichés; their emotional logic remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lysa’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her perception of vibrations as sentences, her tactile reading of walls, and her quiet renunciation of restoring the axis feel earned and specific. Her motivation arises organically from her trait of sensitive perception, which directly enables her discovery of the diaries and tapestry. The final choice—to catalog rather than restore—is a credible endurance that forecloses hope with visible cost: the acceptance that dreaming minds are gone “like extinguished lanterns.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in concrete sensation (tingling fingertips, hums in concrete).

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lian’s contradictory impulses—desire for control versus fear of consequence—are embodied in micro-choices like burning old fortunes and altering the lens shutters. Her internal conflict is rendered through precise, sensory action rather than exposition. The courier’s arrival forces a decisive trade-off that crystallizes her shift from passive predictor to active composer. Flawed yet capable, she avoids diagnostic self-awareness while remaining morally ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s internal conflict—between conquest and connection—is rendered through embodied stillness and micro-choices (e.g., drawing the circle), not exposition. Selo’s motivation is consistent and deepened by his tools (rhetoric, ash blue). The parasite’s influence manifests as rewoven posture, not abstract possession. Final renunciation (“the unknown was not an enemy but a neighbor”) emerges from prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—chronological homesickness manifests not as abstract longing but through tactile rituals (folding paper, mapping memories) and micro-choices (saving one strip, placing the shell). Contradictory impulses coexist: desire to retrieve the past vs. need to seed the future. The final renunciation—conducting silence instead of chasing return—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost: exhaustion yields to purpose, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lysa’s internal conflict—between gravitational autonomy and emotional gravity—is rendered through embodied contradiction: she “floats away from people” yet kneels to press the tablet to her chest. Her micro-choices (testing timelines, choosing one where she “stayed”) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the weight of commitment. No therapy-speak; fear manifests as spatial avoidance, not diagnosis. The final renunciation of infinite branching for singular vulnerability is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s deafness is not a trait but a lived sensorium—she “reads music in faces and floors,” and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying numbness as a “blank stare from herself.” Her micro-choices (using the needle as a blade, conducting backward rhythm) reveal a hierarchy of values: feeling over hearing, movement over stasis. Kerrin’s pressure is immediate and relevant, his numbness mirroring hers without diluting focus. The final renunciation—accepting silence as shapeable rather than broken—is earned through tactile struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s meticulous storm-recording discipline informs every micro-choice under pressure, from feigning cloud-watching to lateral escape tactics. Interiority is embodied (“breathing sounded like a barometer ticking”) and avoids diagnostic labels. Mara’s brief appearance functions as crucible without diluting focus. The final renunciation of solitude-as-cage feels earned through consistent traits and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—aromatic caution versus the need to grieve—are embodied in precise, sensory-laden choices (e.g., lifting the lamp, uncorking the vial “only a finger’s width”). His emotional progression avoids diagnostic labels; tears are framed as “memory insisting on being felt,” not therapy-speak. The final renunciation of selling light for stewardship is earned through his mother’s hidden ledger entries and the vial’s revelation, with visible cost in his lifelong guilt. His flaw—trading her final shift—directly fuels the central conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    The poet’s contradictory impulses—desire for time’s texture versus ethical restraint—are embodied in tactile choices (rope handling, knot-tying) and never summarized. His “ethically playful” stance manifests in the slipknot solution, which carries visible cost: he remains outside the grotto, listening but not participating. The escapee’s backstory is concretely anchored to the rope’s physicality, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation (not cutting the rope) is earned by prior causality and forecloses personal discovery for communal mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s acoustically perceptive trait is not just stated but embodied—her “private thunder” and the hush’s “shape” reveal internal conflict through sensory specificity. Her micro-choices (carrying the bowl, kneeling at the cistern, choosing soft bowing) align with her father’s teaching and her desire to honor incompleteness. The final laugh—“hearing her own laugh return without shame”—shows credible emotional progression with visible cost: she endures the burden of perception to unbind silence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—affectionate detachment versus a yearning to fuse insight with empathy—are dramatized through micro-choices (e.g., charging the blotter with her own shame) rather than stated. Orin’s guilt and numbness are embodied in gestures (“touching his chest as if checking a cracked compass”) and half-truths, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—taking payment while inscribing the brother’s name—carries visible emotional cost and forecloses emotional possession without sacrificing tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “careful kindness” and professional acuity shape micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Eli’s quiet shame and relief feel earned, not sentimental. Their mutual recognition of invisible labor creates authentic emotional reciprocity without over-explanation. The locket anecdote deepens motivation without veering into diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sava’s motivation—to graft herself onto community through craft, not pleading—is embodied in every choice, from offering reed signs to weaving the lattice. Her internal contradiction (longing for belonging vs. fear of rejection) manifests physically in her handling of stalks and silence. The final dedication is earned by prior causality: her reed spirals foreshadow the arbor’s living lattice. Cost is visible: she risks irrelevance, then earns inclusion through irreversible creation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rin’s motivation—finding where echoes are born—is rooted in her profession and deepened by the pendant’s warmth, driving increasingly risky choices. Her internal contradiction (desire for resolution vs. recognition that echoes thrive in interruption) culminates in a deliberate refusal to complete the cadence, which feels earned. The micro-choice to break the final tap aligns precisely with her arc and the story’s thematic logic. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through breath, heat, and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lysa’s motivation—rooted in ambiguous loss and a childhood trait of gentle invention—is rendered through concrete, embodied choices: repairing the mosaic, using the glass eyes as lenses, transforming the ladder into a bridge. Her internal contradiction (urge to run vs. demand for proof) manifests simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—accepting reachability without retrieval—is earned by prior causality and carries the quiet cost of unresolved grief. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s motivation—to become visible through felt presence, not sight—is embodied in micro-choices (caching aid, tracing pipe chases) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: his continued invisibility. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are rendered through sensory memory and tactile action (“tasted burnt dust,” “pressed the tape fragment to his cheek”). The child’s whispered “thank you” crystallizes his earned stasis: he remains hidden but feels seen—a credible renunciation with emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. necessity of concealment) act simultaneously without resolution, deepening authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “circuitously sincere” nature, muddy hands, and scientific detachment clash with her visceral transformation. Her micro-choices (scrubbing hands, releasing control of vines) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The metamorphosis avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead manifesting through nails darkening and sensing ferns breathe. Final renunciation of control feels earned by prior resistance and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The insomniac painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt in his lungs, shaking hands, wry earnestness—and his motivation (to thresh meaning from experience) directly fuels key choices. Mara functions as a crucible: their exchange over the brooches crystallizes mutual grief and need. The final act of leaving one brooch behind is earned by prior emotional buildup and carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (hope vs. skepticism) pulse through action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lan’s internal contradiction—his desire to magnify everyday magic versus his unreliable gift—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., guiding without lantern, confessing failures mid-possession). Sera’s motivation crystallizes not as a quest for spectacle but for attention to the mundane, revealed through her whispered wish and subsequent song. Both characters act from consistent, flawed cores; Lan’s inhabitation feels inevitable because his blind spot (trusting his map despite its mutability) directly enables the force’s entry. The final counter-song reveals moral complexity without safety-hedging: redemption comes through vulnerability, not mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she practices “navigated absences” while yearning for closure, embodying grief as both burden and compass. Her micro-choices (spacing Sorrel’s visits, reading names to shuttered doors) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Ilven’s trembling hands and Sorrel’s torn notebook deepen secondary pressure without diluting focus. The boy’s challenge (“why bother with lists?”) crystallizes the central tension between erasure and remembrance, making Mara’s response feel earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her self-deception, fear of change, and analytical compulsion converge in concrete choices (e.g., admitting her drinking aloud). The phantom punch externalizes her internal conflict without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation (“silence felt safer than change”) is earned through prior behavior and carries emotional cost. No head-hopping; secondary character (conductor) applies precise thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her “sympathetic skepticism” manifests in micro-choices (polishing instruments she doubts, transcribing despite disbelief) that reveal a hierarchy of values: kindness over certainty. Her grief for her brother remains unspoken yet palpable, and the tile’s activation through breath and pressure embodies emotional contradiction without therapy-speak. Jory’s vulnerability and Leena’s arrival deepen relational stakes without flattening anyone into archetype. The final act—offering the logbook “without promises”—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of opening oneself to others’ pain.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilias’s immortal boredom and yearning for post-goodbye knowledge manifest in embodied contradictions—his “manufactured” intrigue, his frayed patience—and culminate in a renunciation that costs him his immortality. Maris is equally specific: her fatigue, cult past, and role as guardian feel lived-in, not expositional. Their dynamic pressures Ilias toward the final choice without melodrama. The amulet’s curse ties directly to their intertwined arcs, making the closure emotionally legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “ledger in her head” and obsession with fair trade manifest in micro-choices (hiding Mercy, writing in margins) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her contradiction—con artist’s child who craves truth—is active, not abstract, and culminates in an Earned Stasis: she refuses Ivo’s con while accepting the cost of familial rupture. Sami and Ivo apply immediate, legible pressure; their presence sharpens Mara’s moral calculus without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Haru’s motivation—to collect textures of time before they fade—is embodied through precise, tactile actions (gilding, notating hums, placing slips) that reveal interior contradiction: he mourns silence yet resists despair by inventing histories. His earnest studiousness drives micro-choices (e.g., charting dawn hums) with visible cost: solitude, emotional restraint, and the burden of sole witness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through cedar-smelling hands and gold leaf that “shines while his voice stays low.” Final renunciation—accepting silence as a “pause waiting to be scored”—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through synesthetic perception and layered memory-gathering, avoiding diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—collecting fragments, prying open Container 9H, whispering rescued names—are consistent with his erasure-driven hunger for texture. The final renunciation of claiming others’ identities is earned by prior accumulation, foreclosing reintegration but granting resonant shape. His flaw (reliance on borrowed histories) directly enables both survival and the story’s closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “gloomy cheerfulness,” tactile engagement with objects, and reimagining of past conversations reveal a psyche shaped by longing and intellectual rigor. His motivation (to decode a universal riddle) emerges not as abstract curiosity but as emotional archaeology, driven by personal ache. The final retellings demonstrate credible endurance: he doesn’t erase pain but reshapes its resonance, foreclosing the path of passive myth-busting with visible emotional cost (damp cheeks, relinquished compass). His flaws—idealism, susceptibility to poetic artifacts—are consistent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ira’s dual allegiance is embodied in micro-choices—smiling at investors while tagging warnings—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal conflict operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and culminates in a credible renunciation with visible cost: exhaustion after painting the final mural. The stone chip isn’t just a prop; it constrains her tactics and forces improvisation within tight spatial and temporal limits. No diagnostic label-speak mars her crisis; emotion stays tactile (“desperation sharpened her hope into a plan”).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s “purposefully curious” trait manifests in embodied choices—her timed chemical messages, her secret photographic motive—that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Eli’s quiet endurance (“someone had to watch the instruments”) crystallizes his character without exposition. Their micro-choices under pressure (Mara priming strips, Eli pinching sand) expose internal contradictions: devotion to vanishing beauty versus duty to progress. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in scorched pine smell and starch-ink words blooming blue.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio’s blindness is not a trait but a lived epistemology—his perception through sound, water, and vibration defines his choices and ethics. His micro-decisions (requesting mist-light, calibrating by fountain-refraction) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in embodied knowledge. Captain Sera’s trust emerges from mutual recognition of non-visual navigation, deepening their dynamic without exposition. The final calibration tag in raised dots crystallizes his worldview: direction as dialogue, not domination.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Riven’s dry wit, embodied anxiety (“each mile tightened my throat”), and professional obsession cohere into a singular voice under pressure. His micro-choices—tracing condensation, speaking the phrasebook question aloud—reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, observation over action. Lysa functions as calm counterweight without diluting Riven’s interiority; their dynamic sharpens stakes without head-hopping. The final renunciation—listening before drawing—is earned by his prior attention to water’s “testimony.”

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sava and Mara are rendered with precise interiority and embodied contradiction—Sava’s cryptic patience versus bleeding soles, Mara’s hesitant joining. Their relationship functions as a crucible: the braided rhythm alters both character and setting (lintel easing, shutters unwarped). Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values (walking despite pain, trusting sound over sight). Flaws are active, not decorative; motivation intensifies under pressure without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her panic, grief, and resolve manifest through tactile detail (silver beads of breath, warming vial) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses—flight versus reverence—clash in real time during the unsnarl sequence, and her final choice to inhale the hush reconfigures memory as both burden and bridge. The vial’s personal history with her mother grounds motivation without exposition, and the cost of her endurance (near-asphyxiation for connection) is viscerally rendered. No safety-hedging; her flaw is her devotion to the ephemeral, which nearly kills her but also saves her.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cry-wolf boy’s motivation is rooted in generational shame and a desire for quiet restitution, not spectacle. His internal conflict—between inherited untrustworthiness and yearning for truth—is embodied through micro-choices: hovering, whispering into the lattice, leaving the door ajar. The final renunciation (letting others find the bodies without claiming credit) forecloses personal vindication with palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile perception (“bare feet skating,” “lattice warmed like a coal”).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, guilt, and longing pulse through tactile details like the bead’s heat and the resonator’s hum. His contradictory impulses (to flee vs. repay, to heal vs. hide) act simultaneously in key scenes, especially when he sings his heartbeat into alignment with the stone. The final renunciation—returning the bead as “the last note of my living pulse”—is earned by prior causality and carries profound emotional cost. The ghost bride, though spectral, exerts immediate pressure that forces irreversible choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ila’s haunting optimism is not merely stated but embodied in her micro-choices—sewing thread into rock cracks, trusting sleepwalkers—and consistently tested by the town’s fear and the labyrinth’s instability. Her internal contradiction (grief vs. hope) operates simultaneously in scene, especially when she chooses thread over sermons. The brother’s testimony grounds her belief in tangible, character-specific logic tied to weaving. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile action (“dust on his lashes,” “orchid-colored thread”).

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her doubt, curiosity, and fatigue manifest through tactile choices (listening to drafts, mixing orchard clay) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Her contradictions feel lived: she distrusts miracles yet trusts work; seeks arrival but learns to value direction. The final renunciation of departure is earned by prior causality—the tremor, the notebook discovery—and carries visible cost: she stays, rebuilding not just stone but faith. Father Sava’s arc complements hers without overshadowing, his softened sternness a quiet counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear in “hard dots over an i,” tactile memory of chalk, professional ritual with the clipboard—and their micro-choices (scanning margins, inventing ‘M. Return’) stem from consistent traits. The courier’s trembling hands and evasive eyes create immediate secondary pressure without headcount bloat. Contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. caution, professionalism vs. moral intervention—act simultaneously during the discovery of ghost-notes. The final pseudonym choice carries visible cost: complicity in a trap that risks exposure.

    Ivo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his craft, fear, and compassion interweave without sentimentality. His micro-choices (pinning the oathfern, using the tether as a bow) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The Midnight Thief isn’t a foil but a mirror, forcing Ivo to confront misalignment rather than evil. Final renunciation of judgment in favor of repair feels earned, with rust itself as witness to cost.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sensibly eccentric” trait manifests in concrete actions (labeling rain, psychometry readings) and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses ownership of the lagoon’s hush. Her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. reverence, collection vs. offering) operate simultaneously during the cave descent. The final choice—to pour petrichor into the lagoon—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: accepting that some truths cannot be captured. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with driftwood, her half-laughing terror, and her quiet competence under pressure reveal a character shaped by craft, not exposition. Her contradictions (solitude vs. communal responsibility, skepticism vs. openness to magic) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice—to translate complex knowledge into accessible symbols—is earned through prior micro-decisions (lighting the lantern, carving the spiral). Cost is felt in her relinquishment of solitary artistry for civic mediation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lina’s motivation—rooted in grief, curiosity, and maternal legacy—is consistently embodied through tactile actions (handling postcards, climbing stairs, pressing forehead to glass). Her internal contradiction between hunger for answers and quiet restraint manifests in micro-choices: waiting for “dawning hush,” listening to rustle rather than demanding explanations. The final act of painting the cathedral window into the mural is a renunciation of private revelation for communal witness, with visible cost: she carries the weight of her mother’s engineered gentleness into public art.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The archivist’s motivation—“not heroism but to uncover truth in tension”—is embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, arranging debris) and internal contradiction (duty vs. fear of retraumatizing the living). His professional restraint (“file what happened without smoothing the burn marks”) feels authentic, not performative. The final parley reveals a hierarchy of values: archival integrity over extraction, consent over exposure. Flawed yet principled, he avoids diagnostic self-awareness even under retrocognitive duress.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sen’s rejection of false comfort is embodied in concrete choices—soap-making, refusing to open the bottle—and his internal contradiction (yearning for civilization vs. commitment to earned labor) drives every action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Erem’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his fear, reverence, and moral urgency pulse through tactile detail (“papers tremble,” “chest vibrate like an instrument”). His contradictory impulses (duty vs. dread, archiving vs. intervening) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice—to broadcast the warning—is earned by prior causality: his belief that emotional patterns are binding contracts. Cost is felt in the “soft unease of saved lives,” a resonant, non-triumphant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his “quiet storm,” trembling fingers, and tactile seed-sorting reveal layered contradiction without diagnostic labels. His motivation (to feel borrowed time) drives micro-choices that escalate logically: arranging seeds by entropy isn’t ritual but active repayment of temporal debt. The grandmother’s silent corridor vision reframes his inheritance not as privilege but obligation, making his final act of labeling planters a credible endurance with visible cost. No safety-hedging; his flaws (impatience, inherited burden) compound until resolved through earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)

Flaws like institutional loyalty and technical perfectionism complicate without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—his grief is neither armored nor performative but lived in mopping, tracing, and holding glass. His micro-choices (reopening the dome, inviting others) emerge organically from vulnerability-as-strength, with clear cost: enduring communal silence instead of solitary numbness. The logbook revelation deepens rather than overrides his arc, preserving agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through action and tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief, duty, and quiet guilt manifest through tactile observation and micro-choices (e.g., reading ghosts “through contextual clues” like a beekeeper reads hives).

Mara’s ghost catalyzes no sudden epiphany but a deepening of prior resolve, making the covenant’s release feel earned. The cost—years of hoarding grief—is palpable in every restrained gesture.

    Eli’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his tactile yearning for time’s “texture,” the urn shard as emotional ballast, and his quiet renunciation of borrowed time all reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche. His micro-choices (following the tag, placing the fragment) carry visible cost and align with his core desire to *feel* rather than count time. Mara functions effectively as pressure incarnate, not a foil, and her ink-stained hands echo Eli’s own archival impulse. The final duty emerges organically from his established traits, not imposed resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rian’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through concrete micro-choices—mending nets, stitching kites, binding a drake’s foot—that embody his belief in beauty-in-incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation—fostering interspecies respect before death—is rooted in her systematic observation and enacted through high-stakes choices (e.g., bending sacred trees despite pain and opposition).

Final renunciation (lying down between pillars) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of mortality made meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s "luminous skeptic" identity drives every micro-choice—from rejecting prescribed filters to cracking the vial—and their academically rebellious habit (lab dyes) directly enables the tower’s recognition. Interiority is embodied (“teeth ache,” “skin held a faint lab glow”) and never diagnostic. The final theft is earned by prior causality: skepticism compels direct engagement, not passive observation. Cost is felt in the irreversible break from institutional control.

The final leap feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost legible in relinquished safety.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s buried talent for naming and their visceral, embodied grief—“tasting metal” when recalling the kitchen—create a coherent interior contradiction that intensifies under pressure. The seer’s revelation of the forgotten name triggers numbness, not exposition, and the final act of seeding the stone with raw memory is earned through micro-choices (stroking the feather, pressing it to the stone). Emotion remains sensory and specific (“quill prickled with cold as if holding back lightning”), avoiding diagnostic labels even at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: her fidgeting, regret, and tactical perception fuse flawlessly with her chess-trained mind.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s empirically intuitive nature drives concrete choices—trusting depth marks, following ants—and her final renunciation of inherited debt feels earned through consistent interior contradiction: she sells destinations but avoids choosing one until the promise forces her hand. Her anger at Ellis is palpable yet tempered by recognition of shared fear, avoiding tidy resolution. The chip and note function as embodied extensions of her psyche, not props. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“promise tug at her ribs,” “water licked her calves”).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)

Her flaw—prioritizing readers’ bloodlust over truth—is consistent and causally tied to June’s death and the orchard’s fate. The apology isn’t epiphanic but wrested from her through ritualized pressure, and her final act (writing the correction) forecloses her old persona with visible cost: she accepts imperfect outcomes, not redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly embodied, especially in the tension between “wanderingly exact” attention and inward collapse. Motivation—unraveling cosmic illusions—is consistent and deepened by grief, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ivar’s interiority is vividly embodied—his belief that clocks measure “pressure, wear, hunger, and the small human fear between ticks” reveals a mind shaped by solitude and obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her estrangement isn’t stated but enacted through micro-choices like avoiding Lena’s calls and using the glass disc as ritual buffer.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in walnut-stained hands and jam-stained grins.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)

Rusk’s parallel arc reveals depth without overshadowing; his shift from barking orders to weeping feels causally rooted in tactile memory (daughter singing to whales).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her colorblindness isn’t a gimmick but the lens through which she perceives texture, fracture, and value. Her “innocently cunning” nature manifests in micro-choices: the plant grammar, the flawed portrait, the spiral arrangement—all reveal a hierarchy of values that prioritize mutual awakening over transactional clarity.

Her motivation (“discover meaning in the mess”) is rooted in loss and loyalty, intensified by Sael’s notebook and the vanished rebellion. The final act of sending the message carries visible emotional cost: trembling hands, uncertainty about rebellion’s viability, yet resolve.

The final portrait’s “watery shine” and her sister’s calm-with-pain reflect earned emotional complexity, not tidy resolution. Flaws drive every turn—her obsession with repetition nearly dooms her until she accepts fragmentation.

    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her contradictions (duty vs. truth, silence vs. testimony) pulse through embodied choices like photographing the boot print or leaving the chime to sing. Her moral reckoning feels earned, not declared, and her flaw—complicity through inherited silence—carries tangible cost. The father’s ghost looms without melodrama, and Mara’s micro-choices (taking the label, speaking at the meeting) reconfigure her identity under pressure. No diagnostic labels; emotion lives in mud imprints and smudged ink.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—logic versus wonder—is rendered through embodied choices (shaking hands, watching starlings) rather than exposition. Her sentimental core isn’t just stated but enacted in the jam-jar memory that guides her stirring. The final synthesis of intuition and reason feels earned because her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over guild approval. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion stays tactile and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile memory (the buckle), micro-choices under pressure, and morally fraught restraint. His decision to expose the imposter without accusation—using muscle memory over guesswork—reveals a hierarchy of values where preserving systemic trust outweighs personal vengeance. The clerk’s capture and Nine’s relief crystallize the cost: the watcher bears isolation so others may fly in faith. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in breath length, nicks on metal, and the hush before judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—numbness, clarity, and contradiction coexist without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (bowing to the clone, placing palm on the jar) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation intensifies organically from survival to stewardship. The final renunciation of ownership feels earned by prior causality and emotional groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)

Her choice to build a living puzzle rather than discard the seed reveals a hierarchy of values: stewardship over spectacle. The confrontation with the OrthoGen agent crystallizes her moral calculus without tidy resolution, and her final rule-writing carries the weight of earned renunciation. No safety-hedging; her competence is balanced by vulnerability to manipulation through her own ideals.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Bram’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his “mournfully eager” ache manifests in tactile rituals (macerating leaves, conducting blowers) rather than therapy-speak. His micro-choices (tying the pull cord to twine, kneeling to grind pulp) reveal a hierarchy of values: restoring laughter over dignity or reason. The final image of his wife’s half-sob/laugh and son’s snort earns its emotional weight through Bram’s sustained, flawed agency. No diagnostic labels intrude; grief lives in grit, detergent steam, and unspoken household silence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist and guardian embody contradictory impulses—homesickness vs. fear of uncertainty—that drive micro-choices under pressure. Their interiority is concrete ("eyes bright as trapped moons," "dimensionally homesick") and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—choosing shared stasis over passage—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the pendant dulls, symbolizing relinquished power. Both characters read as individuals shaped by trauma, not archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic obedience versus burning need for agency—is embodied in precise physical details (“tears had learned to stand at attention”) and crystallizes in her micro-choices (filing the hook not to restore but to reimagine). Jun’s presence deepens her motivation without diluting focus, and their shared fear grounds the resolution in mutual vulnerability. The “stoically sensitive” trait actively shapes her actions under pressure, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of passive compliance is earned through prior struggle, with visible cost in the collapsed furnace pit.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—“to find the beginning in every ending”—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., placing the hush shard at the base, not the tip) that reveal a hierarchy of values: listening over broadcasting, humility over control. Her internal contradiction (salvaging vs. surrendering) resolves credibly in action, not epiphany. The final act of dismantling the mast carries visible cost (sore hands, lost infrastructure) and forecloses the city’s old purpose. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile detail (“rusty plates,” “wrenches”) and bodily strain.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lina’s motivation—rooted in her “permanent transient” ache and desire to prevent lonely disappearances—emerges organically from embodied detail (coffee smell, phantom footsteps) and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her resilience isn’t naive optimism but a practiced stance that directly enables her final radio gambit. The older Lina functions as a mirror, not a separate character, preserving single-POV integrity while deepening internal conflict. Final choice carries visible emotional cost: she trades certainty for shared uncertainty, enduring the seam rather than sealing it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—fever, memory slippage, and grief manifest through tactile choices (e.g., yanking the mirror) rather than exposition. Contradictory impulses (desire for control vs. surrender to connection) act simultaneously in the climax. The final renunciation—letting the sinew anchor names—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; even “rational enchantment” is dramatized as practice, not theory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—humble yet fierce curiosity about starlight navigation—is embodied in precise actions: handling the chain link, decoding probe memory with Jae, ascending to test edge geometry. Her internal contradiction (respect for communal grief vs. need to know) manifests physically in silent gestures under guard scrutiny. The final curriculum rewrite earns its emotional weight through prior causality and carries visible cost: risking social censure to prepare children for “unfolded horizons.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from tactile detail (“air cut cold across their masks”) and constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grief is embodied in ash-filled throat and stubborn curiosity, not therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (sitting beside Eli, not grabbing him; speaking to the dead through traced connections) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Eli’s emotional arc is credible and pressured, not ornamental. The final renunciation—revising the dead’s script—is earned by her history and method.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s claustrophobia and devotion to her brother manifest in embodied tension (“terror crowded her ribs”) and micro-choices (counting exhalations, forcing herself into the gap). Her motivation—“to stand by the unremembered”—is dramatized through action, not declaration, and directly fuels her final repair. Internal contradiction (fear vs. duty) operates simultaneously under pressure. The final act of restoring Ken’s log embodies Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her heartbeat-counting compulsion, tactile relationship with the shard, and quiet desperation feel lived-in and specific. Her contradiction (denying loss vs. honoring life) crystallizes in a micro-choice: stopping the count at 6,201. Lyle functions as a pressure-applying ghost, not a crutch; their dynamic forces her toward agency. The final renunciation of counting is earned through embodied struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilen’s motivation—to translate tactile Vey into sound before extinction—is embodied through precise micro-choices: using the diamond, timing whispers to bird patterns, scraping bone as tuning fork. His copper-veined body and quiet articulation aren’t labels but active constraints shaping every tactic. The final act of sating the diamond’s hunger via structured resonance feels earned by his consistent struggle against erasure. No emotional summarizing; grief and obsession manifest in gesture, texture, and withheld volume.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s bitterness and professional disillusionment are embodied in precise, idiosyncratic phrasing (“frost still in your lungs”) and drive her pivotal choice to collaborate with Edda rather than expose Jonas. Jonas’s internal fracture—between human endurance and cosmic surrender—is rendered through physical detail (his laugh not reaching his mouth, then finally cracking with “frostbitten hope”). Their contradictory impulses coexist without resolution until the climax, where Mara’s shift from observer to participant feels earned by prior micro-choices (recording calls, holding the arrowhead). The final renunciation of scientific proof for poetic truth carries visible cost: she files a falsified report, sacrificing professional integrity to preserve fragile humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s motivation—to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—is embodied through precise, sensory-driven choices (e.g., using the locust shell, syncing with the tree’s pulse) that reveal internal contradiction: reverence for organic rhythm vs. rage at systemic enclosure. His final act of co-liberation with the tree earns both change and cost—his violin hand shakes not just with anger but inherited grief. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile micro-choices under pressure. The statues’ transformation into “a new kind of guard” reflects his impact without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)

Nela’s thinness “as a folded envelope” and his handling of her hand “as another fragile parcel” embody emotion without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rowan’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his silence isn’t a void but a textured absence that drives micro-choices (e.g., choosing the wrong turn). His motivation (“silence had ruined his life once”) intensifies into action without therapy-speak or abstraction. The final act of singing with breath, not words, reveals a hierarchy of values: repair over escape, sound over speech. Flaws are integrated—his muteness limits but also enables perception—and the cost (enduring isolation to mend what others abandoned) is felt in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “sanely eccentric precision,” tactile engagement with books, and emotional calibration around the scarf reveal a psyche shaped by solitude and longing.

The final logbook entry crystallizes her transformation without overstatement. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (precision vs. wonder, isolation vs. connection) act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mina’s motivation is rooted in a visceral loss, and her contradictory impulses—clutching memory vs. releasing it—are dramatized through tactile choices (scraping light, hanging the cipher).

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in fingertips that tingle “like a lens” and widows pressing foreheads to paper. The dream’s return as a rustle of pages crystallizes internal conflict without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear as a “careful jailer,” laughter rising like steam—and micro-choices (offering the hair, naming Altair) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The locksmith functions not as a plot device but as a catalyst whose enigmatic presence forces confrontation with self-imposed silence. Motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly from inarticulate yearning to vocalized creation. The final braided loop of hair signifies earned agency, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lissa’s interiority is richly embodied—her habits, tactile curiosity, and emotional contradictions (e.g., scholarly detachment vs. visceral longing) drive micro-choices that culminate in the decisive plucking of the mushroom. Her transformation feels earned: the nineteen-year-old’s forgotten promise reconfigures her present self without sentimentality. The final act—writing the prologue “as a woman keeping faith with her younger voice”—reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over academic distance) with visible cost (decades of estrangement from self). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action (“pressing its cool cap to her tongue the way her grandmother once made her taste rain”).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio and Mara are rendered with precise interior contradictions—Lio’s combative tenderness, Mara’s pride masking fear—and their micro-choices (walking backwards, selecting the fearful mirror angle) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Their emotional states are embodied without therapy-speak, and flaws directly complicate the central task. The final renunciation (Mara speaking her name) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s insatiable creativity and emotional paralysis over Nela’s illness are embodied through tactile, specific gestures—gray sketches, stolen blue—and resolved not by cure but by creative re-engagement. Soren’s calm authority emerges through action (pruning as translation) rather than exposition. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure when the narrator admits fear, triggering the climax. The final choice—to draw fear instead of cut it—feels earned, costly, and true to both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—hands shaking, vision sharpening under stress—and their motivation evolves from duty to ancestral reckoning.

Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, reverence vs. rebellion) act simultaneously in scene. The ancestor revelation lands with emotional and moral weight, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her “guarded kindness” and “methodically curious” nature manifest in concrete choices (e.g., framing maps to “forgive erasures,” refusing to treat the vault as an exhibit). Her motivation—to interpret silence with empathy—drives every action without sentimentality, and her final decision to reframe the map as an archive embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost: she forgoes sealing the chapel, risking institutional disapproval. The archivist functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied (“air thickened with unsaid words,” “rain sounded like soft applause”).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s quietly analytic temperament manifests in embodied contradictions—equations for grief, precise tactile engagement with wreckage—and culminates in an Earned Stasis that forecloses obsession with a visible cost: relinquishing the reel. The “first name basis” relationship with Death avoids gimmickry by functioning as a psychological projection that sharpens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lysa’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “warmly inquisitive fingers,” the grit of ice in the goggles’ hinges, and her emotional tightening at being seen yet still “small” reveal a complex hierarchy of values. Her micro-choices (reading the diary, pulling the brake) stem from consistent traits and escalate under pressure. The final renunciation of promotion isn’t tidy but charged with earned cost: she chooses agency over status. The captain’s posthumous recognition feels like a mirror, not a rescue, preserving her autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)

No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the engine of her perception, driving her reliance on posture, sound, and pattern—culminating in her epiphany that “patterns over portraits” offer belonging. Her micro-choices (listening to the tree, counting indentations by touch, speaking to the foreman by boot rhythm) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in sensory substitution. The flaw compounds under pressure yet enables resolution: she deciphers the safe not despite her limitation but through its logic.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile interaction with light, dust, and paper.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her guilt “tastes like saltwood,” her pulse syncs with gear teeth—and her micro-choices (leaving original parts, crafting a new gear) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

The contradictory impulses—desire to fix versus fear of taking—are active throughout, never summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara, Jai, and the narrator are vividly individuated through micro-choices under pressure (e.g., Mara becoming foreman, the narrator reading chalk as constellations).

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)

    The protagonist’s motivation—seeking the origin of stories to reclaim a self erased by blankness—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (uncorking moonlight, incising absence) and internal contradictions (vendor of blanks yet yearning for beginnings). Mira functions as a catalyst, not a crutch, and the final recognition (“the story was about a vendor entering a floating library”) merges identity with narrative act. The emotional cost—freedom from blankness—is earned through micro-choices (measuring silences, pressing stylus into nothing) that align flawlessly with motive. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory labor.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Safi’s motivation—transforming pain into craft—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (tasting memories, linen-wrapped hands) and intensifies under pressure.
