    Lyra's transformation from glass artist to survival-focused justice-seeker is well-motivated through concrete pressures, with her "steadily adaptive" trait shown through specific actions like learning to trap rabbits and decoding frost patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to translate silence into music drives genuine internal conflict between drowning trauma and creative resolve, with embodied emotion in the bone-deep vibration of the tuning fork. The transformation from "visual scream" to "golden sunrise" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's stubbornness transforms from resistance to sacred determination, driving the climactic repair with earned cost.

The final moment where he "knew what he had to do" facing Maever's "ancient, knowing eyes" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "intergenerational support" phrasing that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete physical reactions (trembling hands, breathing changes). The internal shift from artist to healer is earned through accumulated detail. However, the epiphany about "unused love" arrives somewhat suddenly without sufficient internal contradiction during the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma (mother's disappearance), driving escalating choices through the maze restoration. The internal conflict between being "retrocognitively trapped" and seeking resolution plays out concretely through her interaction with the halo fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("silent, unseen resistance") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete synesthetic perception ("soft cobalt hums and angry crimson spikes") and a meaningful change from vengeance to "sorrowful, weathered peace." The moment of experiencing the mentor's perspective shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("bitter tang of envy" alongside "cowardly justification"). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("sorrowful, weathered peace" could be more embodied).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through specific action rather than exposition, with her "deeper yearning" to "press your ear against destiny's door" manifesting in concrete risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to craft safe zones for inquiry after participating in past failures creates genuine internal conflict. Her abandonment of the bookmark represents earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit 734's singular motivation "to find where thoughts come from" drives every action with clear internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anya's motivation to preserve truth is clear and embodied through concrete actions like holding the lens and feeding pages to flames. The internal conflict between duty and mercy plays out through physical choices rather than abstract rumination.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail (question-mark back, gnarled hands) and her philosophy of finding value in breakage drives the confrontation. The internal contradiction between maintaining a "beautiful lie" while believing in the garden's authentic memory creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for Lord Cederic's somewhat stock characterization as the "numbers-obsessed owner," though his final silent concession shows nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's obsession drives genuine stakes through concrete action (the demonstration), and Vesh's transformation from "icy warmth" skepticism to "raw discovery" tracks causally with visible cost—his worldview permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes from curiosity to sacred duty through concrete discovery. The contradiction between destruction and creation ("not destroying the hall; she was allowing it to sigh") shows simultaneous impulses acting in scene. However, "lately inspired by his puzzling final words" reads as convenient timing rather than earned causality, and some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("Her motivation crystallized").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("bone-deep ache," "legs unsteady") and a character whose professional identity drives meaningful investigation. The protagonist's method of "occupying margins" to understand truth creates genuine character-specific perception. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as "connoisseur of forgotten places" effectively drives her deeper despite mounting dread.

However, "religiously skeptical" feels more labeled than embodied through actual resistance or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes from passive observation to active preservation with clear internal stakes. The transformation from witness to healer is earned through concrete pressure, though her emotional complexity could deepen further during the crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo's silence and eventual smile create genuine character movement through embodied details (hand to throat, single tear). The "first hello" motif effectively links past to present. Minor deduction for Silas remaining somewhat archetypal despite clear motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli's motivation is clear and his twenty-year history of accidental prophecy creates genuine character depth.

The final choice to row toward the lighthouse feels slightly undermotivated from her POV.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ansel's motivation is clear and his methodical approach using the loop pedal shows consistent character logic. The entity's core fear ("You fear the question") provides genuine psychological depth. However, Brother Carver lacks individuation beyond being a vessel, and some emotional transitions feel too smooth under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's chronological homesickness and need to reclaim lost childhood creates compelling internal contradiction, embodied through physical exhaustion against spiritual yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)

The shift from valuing solitude to weaponizing it ("she would use her tools, her credibility, her solitude") shows genuine internal conflict resolved through action, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic clarity ("To nurture integrity in solitude was one thing; to uphold it in the face of a corrosive lie was everything").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through his tears and confusion about the pollen's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelin's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the salt-rimed violin case, her daily navigation to the sunken greenhouse—rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's emotional hollowness enabling her craft is well-established, with her final "quiet, aching loneliness" marking genuine earned change through concrete sensory discovery.

    Aris's internal transformation from controlling scientist to receptive observer is earned through concrete embodied moments—his frown, sitting on the stool, watching vines tremble with anticipation. The final choice to redesign for resilience rather than efficiency carries visible cost (abandoning three years of methodology). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in the middle ("reluctant metamorphosis begin") that briefly pulls from embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's exhausted artist perspective grounds the piece with specific embodiment ("eyes perpetually raw," "weary gait").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's blindness to the pilgrim creates genuine dramatic irony, and her wariness drives measured choices. The pilgrim's "desperate hunger" motivates his deception effectively. However, his transformation from triumph to collapse lacks internal complexity - the reversal feels externally imposed rather than emerging from character contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to reveal the suppressed truth through calculated steps. The "reactively visionary" trait manifests convincingly when her telling of the story triggers a new insight about the memorial's encoded message.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her meticulous nature driving the quest. The internal contradiction between analytical control and artistic perception works well.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (recording frequencies, physical ascent), with her "earnestly studious" demeanor manifesting in practiced ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from skeptic to believer is earned through concrete action with the ephemeral compass and cello, not just epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's purposefully curious nature drives concrete actions (photographing, timing mechanism, choosing to witness). Her internal state layers melancholy with determination effectively.

    Elara's transformation from serene calligrapher to crude puppet performer is earned through specific internal conflict and embodied choices. The contradiction between her pursuit of pristine truth and Kael's demand for painful honesty acts simultaneously in scene, particularly in her physical destruction of her own work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, with his dedication to documenting overlooked histories driving every action. His internal experience of purpose shifting from loneliness to meaning in the butterfly vortex moment earns the closure. The character lacks deeper internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure, keeping this from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in guilt over her technical failure, and her internal conflict between despair and determination drives authentic choices.

Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the revelation moment rather than fully embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from empirical certainty to acceptance of mystery is earned through concrete failure and embodied frustration. The moment of "raw surrender" when she places her palm flat on the tile shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "profound and endless wealth" at closure rather than more embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's motivation as "scheming pacifist" manifests through her cellular memory method, and Kael's transformation from guardian to surrenderer is earned through specific pressure.

Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "beautiful and terrifying sound" rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's shift from passive acceptance to active bridge-building is earned through the ribbon discovery and her recognition of being "rooted here" like the trees.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("brightened disquiet") and limited embodiment of emotion during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)

    Elara's warmly methodical nature drives her investigation and shapes her approach to the supernatural crisis, with her need to "translate confusion into clarity" creating genuine tension against the wrongness she encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelyn's motivation is clear and deepens through embodied action—her fingers reading stone, her will flowing as "suggestion" not force. The contradiction between her role as passive mapkeeper and active healer creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "gardener tending to a frightened thing" metaphor that briefly distances us from her concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—her compulsion to prove coincidences have meaning drives every choice from touching the seed to calculating star paths. The internal contradiction between loneliness and stubborn hope plays out through embodied moments (fingers brushing metal, holding the shard). Her final understanding that the message was "a declaration that someone, somewhere, had also survived" earns the emotional arc through prior struggle, though some interior passages lean toward explanatory rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra's preemptive nostalgia and grief create genuine internal contradiction, particularly in "mourning its passing even as she lived it." Her shift from archivist-as-recorder to understanding identity-as-act-of-looking shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "sculpt identity from experience."

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)

    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction—her terror of confinement versus need for safety—embodied through physical reactions like "stomach lurched" and "scream trapped in her throat." The transformation from "compressed terror" to taking "a full, deep breath" is earned through specific experience. Minor deduction for the father's motivation feeling slightly disconnected from his actions during the inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her specialized practice of acoustic manipulation. The internal arc from "teaching silence how to comfort" manifests through embodied action, though the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final satisfaction reads as earned through the concrete transformation she witnesses in the old woman.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's obsessive drive to find the ascension path is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied moments like grasping the warm ruby flake and the "frantic dance of evasion." The protagonist's shift from "keeper of dead lore" to "guide to a new dawn" constitutes a meaningful change with visible cost (leaving the untouched orchard behind). However, internal contradiction during crisis is told rather than shown, and some emotional beats rely on abstract labels ("wisely adventurous nature yearned") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradiction in Kael's "loaded emptiness" and the youth's physical suffocation on freedom. The mirroring-scars method reveals character through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation shifts believably from professional failure to spiritual redemption, with the zodiac coin serving as both anchor and accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes beautifully from "simple preservation" to understanding "the texture of borrowed time," with his final choice to plant rather than escape showing genuine character evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orion's spiritual curiosity drives concrete action through the glass discovery and compulsive tracing of meteor paths, with embodied emotional cost ("hands trembled and his heart ached").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's tranquil perception and patient observation create a distinctive character whose motivation to preserve unspoken stories emerges naturally from his reclusive nature.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through concrete actions of tending and transforming.

    Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her mercury-glass eyes and nightly visions that "substituted reality with this brutal, clarifying sight."

    Elias's internal contradiction between artistic precision and emotional distance is well-embodied, particularly in "intimately aloof" manifesting through his work.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interior contradiction between Elara's compulsive counting and her determination to reconstruct Julian creates genuine tension. The heartbeat counting is embodied effectively ("metronomic thump," specific numbers) and her motivation crystallizes through action with the porcelain shard. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "fetch wisdom from failure" which could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline—preserving her extinct culture through sound—and her internal conflict between wielding the cursed diamond and risking sanity creates genuine tension. The final transformation where she accepts becoming the instrument shows earned cost through "weeping quietly as the echoes of a dead language swirled around her." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing like "weight of her entire history" without more embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—the seven-year search crystallizes in his delivery of bottled storms to Liora. The internal contradiction between his official role and rebellious purpose creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—her palm on the swan channeling memories of restored joy. The contradiction between her silence and the need to make things sing creates genuine tension. However, the transformation moment relies on somewhat abstract "pouring memories" rather than more specific embodied struggle.

    Lysander's motivation is clear and consistent - freeing ideas trapped behind fear - and drives his interaction with the client. The woman's transformation from fear to understanding shows genuine emotional progression with embodied detail (the tear, her "hushed" movements).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is crystalline and drives every choice, from seeking the greenhouse to following the celestial map. The memory recovery reversal feels earned through established childhood connection.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (gathering color essences, pouring her own hope into the mix). The internal conflict between rational attempts and spiritual solution plays out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her role as mask restorer, with concrete embodied sensations ("cold dread seeped into her fingers," "phantom taste of salt water").

    Elara's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" drives concrete actions throughout, from learning the ghost's visual language to using the heirloom bolt plate as a physical key.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's warmly inquisitive nature drives concrete discovery through the goggles examination, and her shift from "grieving subordinate" to "witness honoring a life" shows earned internal movement.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to complete her father's chart and prove that "empty spaces remember" drives consistent choices through escalating pressure. The shift from methodical observation to acceptance shows earned transformation with visible cost—she becomes "both the archivist and the archived." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("spooled wholeness") that briefly weakens embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)

    Elara's "diligently curious" nature manifests through concrete actions—kneeling at the hopscotch board, tracing glowing lines, translating symbols—with her "sociable isolation" creating authentic tension. The transformation from apprentice to "cartographer of the unseen" is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's motivation ("quiet, persistent need to learn the rhythm of repair") manifests through embodied action and culminates in earned understanding at closure. The internal consistency holds throughout, with his methodical approach to the orrery reflecting his deeper philosophical quest.

    Elara's motivation crystallizes through the puppet head discovery—a sharp turn from adjuster to answerer of a cross-temporal plea.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in experience ("finding too many lost souls"), with genuine internal conflict between reluctance and duty. The woman's terror is embodied effectively.

The final transformation where "The remorse was now his, but it was no longer toxic" shows earned change with visible psychic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "empathetically decisive" trait manifests through concrete actions (speaking to the brass weight, combining technical and lyrical language), and her motivation drives the entire arc.

The final choice to add her voice creates visible change, but deeper internal contradiction would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling - she's an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" whose technical precision ("chaotically precise rhythm") serves an emotional purpose. The final choice to integrate the predecessor's failure into her work is earned through her synaptic training and embodied struggle ("her own cheeks wet with another man's tears"). Minor deduction for slightly abstract internal states in places.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's "prism-minded" perception creates a distinct consciousness that drives discovery, and her transformation from archivist to sentinel carries genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ariadne's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (hands adjusting dials by microns, catching harmonics) and her internal contradiction between cataloging silence and forgiving sound drives genuine change.

Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of emotional resolution coinciding with fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between forcing serenity and experiencing impatience creates genuine tension, particularly when frustration leads to the plant's reactive scent release.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's synesthetic blessing drives authentic internal experience with concrete embodiment ("swirling symphony of hues," "deep ennui"). The motivation to "certify wonder as essential" compels the ice cavern quest with clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation to "quantify the unquantifiable" drives every choice, and her habit of borrowing personalities creates genuine internal conflict when the halo fragment forces wholesale identity swaps.

Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "ancient grief" and limited exploration of his relationship with Elara beyond the letters.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)

Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about his motivation mid-story.

    Master Hira's transformation from "watchful" to "quietly explosive" drives authentic internal conflict. The contradiction between his methodical nature and the donor heart's narrative magnetism creates genuine tension that culminates in integration rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong embodied grief in the memory sequence ("salt spray, the creak of a ship's deck") and earned transformation from isolation to wholeness.

    Kaelen's "logically emotional" trait effectively drives his solution - feeling the lighthouse's pain enables his vibrational approach.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's core contradiction between impatience and patient waiting is well-embodied through "coiled spring in her chest" and her "fierce, contained energy."

Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "hyper-sensitivity" early on.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal journey from pain to acceptance is earned through concrete parallels between vines and love, with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) acting simultaneously in the letter-burning scene.

    The Line Walker's motivation is crystalline—preserve wisdom before singular truth drowns it—and his peripheral awareness method creates compelling internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)

    Kael’s motivation—protecting his community from dependence while nurturing intergenerational strength—is clear and consistently drives his choices. The spying scene and his final resolve reveal credible internal conflict between preserving hope and telling a hard truth. Emotional embodiment is effective (the bell as duty, his breath catching at Maever’s act), though the interior contradictions could cut a bit sharper under peak pressure. Maever’s cunning generosity refracts his leadership in a way that deepens his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—find “where unused love is stored”—is clear and propulsive, and her actions (setting the camera, following the projected cue) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and breath-led memory, giving her particularity as an artist and seeker. The final commitment to become a conduit is earned but a touch tidy, with limited on‑page ambivalence. A stronger contradictory pull or price in the moment would deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear (find mother; “feel the grain of time”), and her choices—analysis via hyperbolic geometry, returning to the bridge, recalculating—track her values. Interiority is specific enough to feel embodied (scent of yew, the burn of the fragment), though contradictory impulses are muted and competence reads a touch convenient. The reunion forecloses her prior haunt (the loop), with an emotional cost implied by the photographs’ demise. Added ambiguity or visible hesitation under stress would deepen character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motive (protect the seeds) drives action, with embodied detail (the chain’s weight, the flat thunk of keys) revealing resolve under strain. His renunciation at the end—choosing entombment—reads earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction is modest (duty outweighs fear with little wavering), keeping it just shy of the very top tier. The sentry’s brief presence adds pressure without diluting the single‑POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s obsession is specific and propulsive, and her choice to activate the forge under known psychic cost reads earned. Interiority is textured (synesthetic perceptions, professional lens) without therapy‑speak. The contradictory pull (need for the sound vs dread of reliving betrayal) is implied more than dramatized in the approach beat, slightly softening peak tension. The final renunciation of vengeance to “weathered peace” feels credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (yearning to “press your ear against destiny’s door”) informs precise, character‑particular choices (the flower codes; the plea instead of a spell; the gantry leap). Interiority is sensorial and embodied, with fear and resolve coexisting under pressure. The contradiction is modest (awe vs. risk) but credible. No second on‑page relationship strand limits crucible complexity at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to build “sanctuaries of glass” and shed collective guilt—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (handling the bookmark, firing the furnace, the final relinquishment). The internal contradiction (attachment to the past vs. the resolve to build anew) operates in scene. Emotions are embodied via tactile rituals and the soundscape of thaw. Slight over‑explaining of past arrogance softens the need for inference.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—hyper‑competent body under professional reflexes versus ocean terror—are dramatized in concrete micro‑choices (scraping glitter with a shell, planning the dive while nauseous). Motivation is clear and intensifies from deciphering the cast to plunging despite panic. The final shift (accepting fear as tool) is earned by prior beats and paid with visible cost (sobbing, gasping). Minor on‑the‑nose labeling of motive appears once but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—mapping silence—is clear and embodied through tactile action and a long-honed method. Her interiority is distinct and sensorial, with a credible tension between compulsion and awe (“chilled and compelled”). The change at the end—relinquishing listening to begin walking—lands, though the internal contradiction in-scene remains gentle rather than pressured. The piece favors poise over struggle, limiting peak complexity of character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit 734’s drive—finding the source of thought—is clean, character‑specific, and governs every choice. Its composure and curiosity create a credible internal tension that reads as distinctly robotic rather than humanized therapy‑speak. The culminating renunciation of multiplicity (facilitating amalgamation) registers as a meaningful change. Emotional embodiment is necessarily cool; a slightly stronger felt cost in the merge would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and consistent, with a credible moral conflict sharpened by the lens discovery and the choice to burn the logbook. Micro‑choices (pulling the donor file, using the lens, not making a copy) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The renunciation costs her professional creed, which reads on the page. A slight tilt toward didactic self‑justification in the last lines tempers the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive and worldview are vivid and consistent, embodied through tactile gardening tactics and the cracked marbles ritual. Her fear-pride mix under Cederic’s scrutiny surfaces in concrete choices (revealing the artifice, holding the marble up). Internal contradiction is quiet (truth vs necessary lie) but present rather than dramatized as a wrenching struggle. Status dynamics in the brief dialogue are legible and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s drive to prove time “moves sideways” cleanly motivates her actions, and Vesh’s skepticism credibly melts into awe. Interiority is light—most emotion is implied through gesture and setting—but the wrist‑grab “Wait” vs. Aris’s firm lever push shows a real value clash. The relationship dynamic (authority vs. visionary) sharpens under pressure without melodrama. The final renunciation (she shuts it down) carries modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive is clear and rooted in her long relationship with the hall and Maestro, and her embodied choices (wading, decoding, tuning to the building) align with those aims. Interiority is textured (the water as reagent, hearing silence), though internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or resists. The “sacred duty” crystallization reads earned by prior beats. A hint more friction (risk to the instrument or fear of desecration) would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhys’s motives are clear and character‑specific: an analyst who trusts margins over centers, compelled to test a swallowed anomaly. Embodied details (scratchy blanket, unsteady legs, the anxious smudge) ground his interior shifts. The contradictory impulses—comfort in systems vs. allegiance to peripheral whispers—coexist credibly and culminate in an earned stance. The cost (loss of certainty in exchange for truth) lands without tidy self‑help language.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular (“drowsy alertness,” skepticism battling visceral fear), and her micro-choices under pressure (approaching, interpreting, then turning the wheel) align with established traits. The reckless-explorer frame motivates risk-taking credibly. The cost lands in the final image as a burden assumed. The only softness is how quickly she makes the leap about talk‑radio psychics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the library’s healing silence—intensifies credibly from observer to healer. The internal tension between “witness without judgment” and choosing to intervene is dramatized at the breach. Embodied perception (the hum as pressure on skin) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The cost registers as exhaustion and a fragile, ongoing duty rather than a grand sacrifice, but it’s earned.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—nurturing wonder—is clear and enacted through specific choices (the walk, the waiting, the timed reveal). Leo’s internality is mostly embodied rather than voiced, but the throat-touch and single tear land. The therapist reads a touch idealized, with few visible flaws or contradictions under pressure. Still, the micro-choices feel earned and the final connection is credible for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alistair’s motives are clear and particular—an archivist of walls whose grief forces a redefinition of purpose. His embodied perception (scent of aged paper, the tactile tapestry) grounds emotion beyond labels. The internal turn from collector to “become the wall” reads earned and carries cost. Minor limitation: internal conflict is more thematic than oppositional in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eli’s motive—to intervene without overt control—reads cleanly and governs every choice, culminating in the conductor vs. puppet‑master contrast. His embodied habits (flour dust, aromas, precise brush) individualize him. The contradiction (urge to act vs. restraint) is present but could be pressured harder on the page. Lena’s agency emerges credibly, though her interiority is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motive (save Carver by interrogating the void) and a credible tactic shift (from attack to listening) under pressure. Interiority is mostly conceptual and disciplined; we feel the cold fog pressure and his composure, but contradictory impulses are faint. The cost of the choice registers in the spent pigment and fatigue implied by the crescendo. Relationship stakes with Carver land briefly but effectively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive is precise and embodied—chronological homesickness fuels a ritual that taxes her body and focus. Micro‑choices (placing the nautilus, whisper‑mapping, the final benediction) align cleanly with motive. Inner contradiction is subtler—longing vs. acceptance rather than a sharp split—but the earned renunciation at the end feels credible. The cost—exhaustion and relinquishing a literal return—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (to conquer the labyrinth of self) is clear and complicated by his flaw (control/avoidance), culminating in a credible renunciation at the edge. Interiority is vivid and embodied via the tablet, viaduct, and memories (“shame was acid”). The contradiction—defy gravity vs. accept falling—acts in scene, not just in summary. A touch of abstract phrasing (“torturous beauty”) slightly blunts the rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Inara’s motive—defeating her emotional numbness—is crystal and drives concrete choices (the phonograph, reverse‑playing, staging the recital). Interiority is embodied through tactile perception rather than labels, giving specificity to her loss and hunger. Leo reads more functionally than interior, but his arc supports her central drive. A sharper on‑page contradiction (fear vs. risk) at the performance moment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—integrity in solitude—drives clear, escalating choices from measured routine to a risky act of whistleblowing. Interiority is specific (breath control, sensory vigilance) and her curiosity credibly overrides fear. The internal conflict (safety vs. truth) is present if a bit tidy; she solves quickly with high competence. The final act forecloses safety with a felt cost (waiting for footsteps).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s longing to decode his own tears and Elara’s wistful empathy create clear motives that drive concrete choices (mask removal; breaking the vial seal). Embodied emotion lands—“tears carving clean paths through the dust”—and the final reframe is earned by on‑page cause. Interiority is selective but sufficient for this length; the relationship dynamic is gentle yet functional. Minor safety in Elara’s certainty (the vial works without much doubt) keeps it just short of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s desire, flaw set (freedom-seeker tempted by knowledge), and contradictory impulses are clear and embodied through the rope and the grotto. The prison-escape memory grounds his motive without over-explaining, and his final renunciation feels earned by prior choices. Emotional texture is specific (ozone, clay, pulsing walls) rather than labeled. The resolution leans tidy but not unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelin’s motive—“to find beauty in the unfinished” and to answer the silence on Remembrance—is clear and drives every action. Interiority is specific (her tactile relation to the bowl, the acoustical sensitivity) and embodied without cliché. The arc from seeker to listener-in-conversation reads earned. A minor limit: little on-page contradiction; her resolve meets scant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are specific and credible: a clinically gifted maker of emotions unable to feel them, driven to solve “fusion” anyway. The synesthetic static‑tasting and the blotter‑carrier insight reveal character through craft. Her acceptance of a perfect replica over truth lands as an earned renunciation with cost. A slight remove in on‑page struggle (no opposing character) keeps the crucible quieter than peak.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear—Elias’s intent to uplift Maeve drives every beat—and his measured vulnerability reads credibly in how he softens his voice and frames the gift. Interiority is modest but specific (brokerly metaphors of weight and worth), though internal contradiction remains mild. The relationship dynamic progresses believably from formality to warmth. The final recognition of Maeve’s unseen labor earns a small but real shift rather than a grand turn.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelin’s motivation—to graft into community—is clear, embodied (calloused fingers, the “luminescent ache”), and it drives concrete choices (organizing the search, dedicating the arbor). The frustration/curiosity split at the tag is a credible internal contradiction. Some beats (forming the group, mapping) are summarized rather than dramatized, which modestly limits pressure on the self. The final renunciation of a solitary offering in favor of communal dedication feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular (an illustrator obsessed with acoustics seeking “where echoes are born”), and her final choice credibly pits heritage (the pendant) against civic/ontological stakes. Interiority is largely image‑driven and avoids therapy‑speak, though the conflict could use one more embodied wobble at the brink. The heritage reveal edges toward convenience but is integrated via the pendant and her attention to cadence. The cost is felt in her renunciation, earning the charged final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s intellect-versus-feeling contradiction is clear and embodied, and her micro-choices (choosing the glass eyes, placing them on the mosaic) align with her goal while revealing cost. Motivation is consistent and escalates from quantification to acceptance. The arc from secretiveness to openness lands credibly through the lens shift. A touch of abstraction remains, but the interiority stays particular.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—visibility as presence rather than person—is specific and consistent, and her tactile competence grounds her. The internal tension between invisibility and the need to make truth visible registers, though it isn’t deeply contested on the page. Her micro‑choices (following the sense memory; deciding to place the box openly) align with motive. The cost of exposure feels hinted rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation and contradiction (control vs. curiosity) are cleanly dramatized through micro‑choices—opening vents, shutting off systems, choosing to witness. The shift reads earned by accumulated failure and the storm’s pressure. Emotional texture is embodied (“blank tablet,” “leaf on his knee”) rather than labeled. Slight neatness in the epiphany keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s drive—exhausted, meaning‑seeking—reads embodied and specific, and his micro‑choices (leaving the cottage, choosing the bread) align with his nature. The brief negotiation with the woman gives a clean relationship crucible without overreach at this length. Contradiction is mild but present (feeling he has “nothing” then recognizing the bread’s story). The cost he pays is modest yet credible for the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her failure to foresee the pilgrim and her wariness undercut by competence feel lived. Her decisive lantern tactic grows from an “old teaching,” aligning motive with action under pressure. The pilgrim is thinly drawn as an antagonist, with motive reframed late; his inner life stays schematic. The final repricing (“magnify not just magic, but understanding”) reads earned but the felt cost to Elara remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s goal is clear and consistent—restore suppressed truth and hearten the city—and her “reactively visionary” trait is dramatized when the memorial’s markings trigger her connecting leap. Interiority is concise yet character‑specific, with tactile ties to her vocation. However, there’s little on‑page internal contradiction or visible cost in her choice at the climax, keeping the arc from a higher band. The crowd/old woman response reveals her through action rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and contradictions are clear—“heart a frantic drum… mind a calm sea of logic”—and her micro-choices (following the arrows, selecting the largest portal) align with her traits. The interiority is concrete and character‑particular (analytically artistic perception). However, pressure is gentle; she meets little resistance and pays little visible cost beyond the implied renunciation of safety. The final commitment reads earned but lightly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance is clear and consistent, with a credible shift from analytic transcription to participatory reflection. Interiority is concrete (the entangled sensations of pressure, krill, grief), and actions align with his motive to create space for reflection. The internal contradiction—skepticism vs. wonder—drives the final decision. Cost is lightly sketched, with little on‑page friction beyond surrendering doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character-specific: the bored immortal rekindles drive to “discover what happens after goodbye.” Her agency is steady and her tactics (reading lattices, exploiting a flaw) align with her traits. Internal contradiction is limited—apathy flips to focus without much friction—so the arc reads competent more than conflicted. Still, embodied moments (the shard’s ache, risk of mind-shatter) add texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with credible contradictory impulses (cold “fair trade” calculus vs. destabilizing empathy after the reveal). Micro‑choices—handling the ink pot, pocketing the passport, choosing to “wait actively,” then greeting mourners—align with motive. The reversal from moral condemnation to complex grief reads earned, not tidy. A few declarative lines (“Her method was not to storm out…”) verge on telling but remain anchored in on‑page action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motive is clear and particular, and her micro‑choices (the ascent, the calibration of breath to the lamp, the notation instead of words) align with a meticulous temperament. Interiority is embodied through tactile detail (foil on hands, cool stone, stiffness) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the piece favors steady competence over friction, so the change reads as earned stasis more than transformation. The felt cost is quiet (spent night, bodily fatigue, relinquishing the visions at dawn), sufficient but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, singular motivation (“to bear witness”) drives concrete choices: creeping the yard, prying the footlocker, confronting the clerk. Interiority is specific (seeing absences rather than presences) and embodied through occupational grit (tides, rust, gulls). A modest but credible internal tension peaks at the office visit and resolves into an earned renunciation. Slight softness remains around his fear and personal risk calculus, which stays mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and character‑particular (a professional skeptic driven, late in life, to test the one myth she created). Interiority is specific—her tactile habit with the shell and the bone‑deep hum—though conflict resolves with relative ease. The contradiction (myth buster turned believer) is earned but not rigorously contested on the page. Her final renunciation of debunking for affirming reads credible, with a soft but legible cost (her “final days”).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rio’s dual allegiance and “orderly intuitive” nature are embodied through choices—the covert graffiti campaign, keeping the stone chip, and agreeing to take the hybrid guild‑hall idea to the committee. Her contradictory impulses (bridge vs. resistance) act in scene rather than being summarized. Emotional texture is specific (the chip’s weight, the sensory dampening) instead of label‑only feelings. The cost is felt but subdued—risk to her position is implied rather than directly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive is clear and compelling, and her micro‑choices (triggering the acid timer, standing her ground after the shot) align with it. Interiority is particular and embodied (breath as metronome, inheritance from the nightwatch), avoiding stock feeling labels. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with felt cost. A minor gap: the “purposefully curious” trait is told more than dramatized, so contradictory impulses remain subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and competence are vivid and particular—her tactile craft and blind-adapted methods feel earned and embodied. Motivation is clear and consistent under time pressure. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely falters or suffers a messy impulse that complicates choice. The closing stance shifts more conceptually than emotionally, limiting felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (to find the rivers’ source) is clear, character‑specific, and governs her choices from noticing the glass‑map to venturing onto the ice. Interiority is textured (atlas editor’s eye, polyglot’s phrasebook) and embodied in cold, breath, and efficient motions. The internal conflict is more steady endurance than contradiction, keeping the arc quiet but credible. The final renunciation—smoothing the dog‑ear, closing “source”—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (restore balance before collapse) is clear and consistent, and her patience informs her method. Interiority remains mostly cool and professional; we glimpse dread but not much contradictory impulse beyond persistence under a deadline. Micro‑choices (route, patterning, when to strike/listen) align with her craft. The ending earns a credible endurance but the felt cost on her person is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (rescue impulse layered over the desire “to harness the ephemeral”) are clear and drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The crucial contradiction—weapon vs. unstoppering the vial—reads earned and character‑specific. Interiority is sensorial rather than diagnostic, though his flaw set beyond ambition/curiosity is lightly sketched. The stewardship acceptance lands with a felt cost but could cut slightly deeper into his prior self‑concept.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and particular—seeking “hush” by rethreading a legacy of lies—and his key choice (to speak truth through the lattice) reads earned. Interiority is concise but specific; the inherited “sin of silence” sets a credible contradiction resolved under pressure. Emotional embodiment leans symbolic more than visceral, so the cost sits more conceptual than bodily. Still, the on‑page renunciation of the family pattern carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (repay a soul‑debt and revive the orchard) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices—searching the roots, interpreting the vision, and ultimately pressing the bead into the ghost’s palm—align with embodied feeling. The internal conflict is subtle rather than wrestling on the page, but the tension between duty and release hums credibly. The final act feels earned and paid with a small, felt cost (letting go, the tear). A shade more contradiction under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thea’s motive and method are vivid and consistent, and her choices (sewing the air, revising the labyrinth) align cleanly with her drive. Interiority is lyric but light on contradictory impulses in-scene; conflict with the council is off-stage. Embodied emotion appears (“basket heavy with frayed rope and resolve”), but we rarely see her falter or pay a personal cost beyond fatigue. The closing stance feels earned, if gently so.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—restore a lineage-based faith—is clear and consistently drives her tactile choices (excavation, observation, renunciation). Interiority is concrete and embodied (“fingertips brushing stone,” fear of disturbing balance). The final stance shift (accepting the tree as gnomon and clearing space) feels earned though the visible cost is subtle. A touch more friction or contradictory impulse under pressure would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—finding “meaning in the margins” through analog craft—is clear and embodied in concrete acts (eliciting what she’ll miss, chalking codes, mailing). Interiority is particular and textured, not generic. However, pressure is low and internal contradiction is faint; he rarely faces a live cost beyond ritual melancholy. The client offers a human counterpoint but does not significantly test him.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and method are crisply defined—she refuses to hand over a damning chart and instead chooses a subtler, risk‑aware guidance. Her composure under pressure shows character‑specific competence, and the “foolishness as cover” trait informs action. Kaelen’s status shift from arrogant to teachable is legible and earned. Slightly limited internal contradiction for Elara keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior drive—to inhabit the moment before decision—reads specific and embodied through tactile ritual and object handling. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. renunciation) operate simultaneously and culminate in Earned Stasis. The unsent letters motif externalizes her self‑forgiveness without therapy‑speak. Change is credible and forecloses a path (actionable reconciliation) with a felt, scaled cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are precise and consistent: the translator who believes in fragile peace translates a child’s terror into a healing tactic. Key micro-choices—refusing to force Kaito to speak, pocketing the coral, directing surgeons to use its pattern—reveal a believable hierarchy of values. The final state (peace without amnesia) is earned by prior choices. Minor strain from clinical phrasing (“re‑pathway the neural lightning”) slightly cools embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to reclaim lost joy—is clear, and her choices (abandoning the planned display to resurrect the old) track cleanly. Interiority is specific to her craft, with embodied frustration (“the fog threatened to swallow each nascent gleam”). Internal contradiction is present but gentle (ambition vs. humility/collaboration), and stakes remain mostly internal. A deeper flaw or cost on the page (beyond ephemerality) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity-driven agency is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (coin’s “low thrum,” scaffolding vertigo) grounding her. Contradictory impulses are light; she pivots from restoration to discovery without much on‑page friction. The shift—trading certainty for curiosity—reads earned but carries a subtle rather than visceral cost. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with credible motives and embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—guarding her “spark of defiance”—is clear and consistent, and her crucial choice (to shatter the code via the gourd) tracks. Interiority is vivid (“a silent scream inside her skull”), though contradiction is modest: protect the language vs. destroy its legibility. Micro‑choices (decoding, deciding to stay, focusing the energy) reveal values under pressure. A richer on‑page cost to her relationships or self‑image would deepen the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear—an insomniac poet tasked with transmuting planetary pain—and her choices (leaving the hut, entering the shell, deciding to carve) align with it. Interiority is specific and embodied (bare feet, humming through soles). The shift from “failure” to conduit is earned by the lullaby’s discovery, though true contradictory impulses are lightly sketched rather than pressed. Cost registers as exhaustion and relinquishing her prior self-conception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation with tactile interiority (“foxglove regret”) and embodied urgency. Choices (searching, inhaling the mist) align with stakes, but contradictions are light—she rarely wavers beyond dread. The arc lands as credible endurance with fragile hope, not a deep internal reconfiguration. A richer clash between caution and risk in the breath/light beat could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is crisp and coherent—repairing a ruptured bond through completing the translation—and her “cautious exuberance” manifests in embodied, character‑particular action (tilting the flawed inkwell). The careful/reckless contradiction operates in scene rather than label‑only. Interiority remains specific to her linguistic mindset. The reconciliation at the end feels earned by prior choices, though the felt cost is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Isla’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: duty to safety versus reverence for history, enacted through micro‑choices (not breaking the seal; working it open; redirecting focus to control veins). Her competence is credible and rooted in tactile craft. The relational pressure with Kael is subtle but effective. The primary softness is the near‑frictionless acceptance of her plan, which dampens the felt personal cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are precise: a self-forged past versus a compulsion to preserve lost songs. Embodied ritual (meteorite balancing, dust‑reading) reveals character under pressure. The final choice to risk Argos is earned by her established fear of leaving a trail. Slight tidiness in her concluding resolve keeps it just short of revelatory complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is precise and consistent—understand the “sacred thresholds” and find her father—and her fear/drive contradiction is dramatized (pausing at the archway, then stepping through). Micro-choices (reading the grain, deciding to cross) align with her temperament and escalate plausibly. Embodied responses (solidified air, crackling paper, deafening roar) keep emotions grounded. The change at the end—no longer lost, committed to finding him—feels earned and carries an emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (a breakthrough that doubles as belonging) is specific and sustained, and her micro-choices—bypassing the array, pivoting to bioreceptors, activating the beacon—align with that need. The despair-to-focus contradiction is credible, though internal conflict could tighten with a sharper cost or competing value on the page. Embodied detail (viewport pressure, groaning joints, feather texture) grounds her emotions. The epiphany lands as earned rather than perfunctory.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Finn’s goal is clear and rooted in a credible temperament—“cheerful” habits under a “profound gloom.” His micro-choices (taking a walk, trusting an absurd conjecture, using the seed) align with his obsession and reveal character. Internal contradiction is present but light; the piece favors fable-like steadiness over thornier conflict. The final renunciation (he cannot stop forgetting; he will document it) carries modest but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive is precise and credible, and his choices align cleanly with his analytical nature. Interiority is specific (moon, tide, probabilities) and embodied through the apparatus. However, there’s little contradiction or real struggle at peak pressure; success comes smoothly, which limits depth. The renunciation of recognition is a quiet but earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aria’s motive—embodied resistance via tattoo—is clear and consistently pursued, with pain and focus rendered concretely. Interiority is particular (needle, starlight, moonstone) and actions align with the goal. The main limitation is a relative lack of contradictory impulses or meaningful hesitation; competence rarely meets friction beyond pain. Still, the final renunciation/embrace feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motive—restoring meaning to his craft—is clear and textured through his glazier’s sensibility. His frustration and pride create a credible internal contradiction that resolves into renewed commitment. The turn arises from his professional way of seeing, not abstract declaration. The cost is modest (accepting the labor with new stakes) but felt at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with the duality of “hard softness” embodied in his hands and choices. The preservation/theft tension around the box gives him a credible contradiction. His decision to speak to recruits reframes his scars with a visible cost—living publicly with them. No therapy‑speak shortcuts; emotion is earned through tactile particulars like the tooth and hair.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and carried through tactile actions (watching the gauge, releasing and repainting balloons). The breakthrough beat (resilience meeting community) credibly shifts her from searching to writing. Internal contradiction is minimal—she remains composed rather than torn—so the cost of the shift reads soft. Embodied moments (“breath caught,” frozen stylus) help but deeper friction is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive (to learn what walls dream) is clear and particular, and her sensory gift meaningfully shapes action and cost. Interiority is textured—“listener of stone,” the scream in the wall—though internal contradiction is modest. The decision to carry and share the burden reads earned. Slight safety: she faces little on‑page resistance beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—to make mirrors show possibilities—drives every choice, culminating in the costly offer of her life force. Interiority is rendered through tactile, specific perception (wet stone, prismatic tears) and a concrete ritual (the lullaby) rather than labels. A touch more contradictory impulse under peak pressure would elevate (serene acceptance dominates over ambivalence), but the endurance choice reads earned and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—to end a forever war through disciplined gentleness—is clear and embodied in micro‑choices (taking up the ritual clipboard, focusing on the grain, guiding the terms). Contradictory impulses (guilt, grief, and serene resolve) operate simultaneously rather than in tidy sequence. The soldier memory and the ledger metaphor ground her stance credibly. Minor abstraction in phrasing remains, but her actions consistently align with her values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradiction—amoral crisis‑curator who yearly cradles a fossilized egg—reads specific and embodied, not labeled. The storm forces a micro‑sequence of competing impulses (curate/preserve vs. release) that culminates in a credible renunciation. The ritual history (“every year… he came here”) earns the sudden pivot. The cost is tangible: he gives up an irreplaceable object and the self‑image it anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation to defy the “lullaby” is clear and consistent, and her internal contradiction (chaste courtesan trained to soothe vs. rebel) produces specific choices. The hesitation before pulling her own silver thread gives a credible, earned cost. Interiority is embodied via sensation (“shock…of pure, undistilled memory”), not labels. Slight abstraction in diction keeps us a half‑step from raw messiness, but the arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction—devotion to pristine beauty versus the demand for messy truth—are clear and embodied in specific choices (shredding her own calligraphy, making the puppet). Her serenity refracts into “focused intensity,” showing change under pressure rather than tidy enlightenment. The final act forecloses a path: she sacrifices her prior artistic identity and privacy. Minor ding: a couple of abstracted thematic lines flirt with telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—animates concrete micro‑choices (collecting, knotting, then refusing to rebuild), and his embodied reactions (“heart a frantic drum,” “felt like held breath”) read specific and earned. The internal contradiction (transiently rooted loneliness vs. found purpose) resolves into a credible renunciation at the end. Pressure remains quiet but character‑particular, not generic. A hair more friction or error under stress could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the sound of forgotten names—anchors every action and reads particular to her craft and guilt. Interiority is concrete (minute pressures, precise heats) and the despair-to-ingenuity pivot feels earned. The contradictory impulses (forgiven self vs. creeping despair) surface plausibly in-scene. The cost is felt but modest; we glimpse strain more than a deep wound.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Foresight’s motives—staving off collapse and interrogating why “paths choose their walkers”—drive concrete micro-choices (sifting dreams, reaching for the wafer, breaking it). Interiority is character-specific and embodied for a machine (barometric warnings as “screams,” manipulators acting with “whimsical curiosity”). The internal contradiction (programmed prediction vs. playful observation) is dramatized rather than told. The final renunciation/redefinition of purpose feels earned by the storm pressure and dream-triggered fixation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, rooted in her frugality with observation and devotion to proof. Her mounting frustration and final surrender show credible contradictory impulses under pressure. The change—relinquishing quantification—is earned by the sequence of failures. A slight tidiness to the epiphany keeps it just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s pacifist cunning and Kael’s weary duty are clear, and her persuasion tactic aligns with her stated method. The internal shift for Kael is credible and embodied (“shoulders slumped… surrender”), though Lyra’s interior conflict remains low-friction and somewhat idealized. The emotional cost—Kael releasing resentment tied to failure—lands but could deepen with sharper contradiction. Dialogue reveals values under pressure without flattening either character.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to “capture” a vanishing dream) is clean and character‑particular, rooted in her identity as a physicist‑artisan. The internal conflict between control/measurement and surrender/harmony is dramatized in the choice to close her eyes and sync breath. Emotions are embodied through tactile work (oiled clicks, frost crunch) rather than labels. The ending shows a credible renunciation—she won’t seize, she will coexist—at a felt cost to her need for control.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s conflicting impulses—age‑brittle resignation vs. responsibility to pass on craft—are dramatized in concrete choices (leaving the rafters, offering the ribboned apple). Lyra’s practicality pressures her and catalyzes the shift by dumping the bag. The relationship evolves credibly from friction to collaboration. The emotional cost (relinquishing a self‑protective vow and sanctum) is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity-versus-duty conflict is clear and embodied (the bathroom lock, the trembling), and her micro‑choices track from rule‑bound to transgressive to purposeful. The motivation to “pursue forbidden knowledge” escalates believably once the shell suggests a secret. The shift from curator to inheritor feels earned, if a touch tidy. A deeper flash of self‑deception or cost would heighten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motives (find the Library; protect Elara/knowledge) are clear and drive concrete, cunning choices (powdering the suit, reading absences, the breath gambit). Interiority is present but more conceptual than embodied, so contradictory impulses under peak pressure are muted. The relationship with Elara adds stakes but doesn’t evolve much beyond partnership. The final renunciation of direct conflict for a loophole feels earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive is clear and embodied—she pursues Idris via tactile anchors (the swatch, the journal) and makes micro-choices that reveal values (descending below, opening the journal, choosing to stay and read). The “trapped freedom” contradiction reads in-scene rather than as a label and resolves credibly. The cost—renouncing departure/life beyond the ship—is implied but felt, though the internal struggle could press harder. A touch of convenience in finding the journal trims the sense of hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (translating confusion into clarity) is coherent and drives her through fear toward action. Interiority is concrete—her “orderly mind recoiled,” yet she chooses to proceed. The competence-forward arc lacks a sharp internal contradiction or visible cost beyond strain. Still, micro-choices under pressure (reading the seal as blueprint; working the braids) reveal character credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, urgent motivation and embodied practice (“listening with her fingertips”) feel particular, and her craft reads lived-in. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she is consistently competent and calm, with little ambivalence or mistake under pressure. The visible cost is mostly fatigue and a role shift, credible but light. Her renunciation—becoming “a keeper of this silence”—lands, but without a thorny trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to prove coincidences have meaning) is clear and enacted through concrete choices—descending, retrieving, calculating, aligning. Interiority is textured (the “shard of hush,” the “crushing weight of failure”) though internal contradiction is modest. The weeks-long effort and poised moment of near-failure show credible endurance under pressure. Slight limitation: her competence faces little error or moral friction beyond perseverance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motive—stewarding collective memory while anticipating its end—is clear and coherently intensified by the fog’s hardening. Interiority is embodied (“her heart a drum,” her hands’ faint shadow) and her final reorientation from archivist to “remembered woman” reads as an earned renunciation. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief vs. self-meaning) operate simultaneously and resolve credibly in an Earned Stasis. A slight risk of abstraction appears in the overt articulation of her insight, but it remains grounded in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—his craft as rebellion and the tactile comfort of the kerosene rag ground him. Interiority is specific (chemicals, fuse‑work) and drives micro‑choices, especially after finding “RISE.” Internal contradiction is muted; he is steady rather than torn, so cost reads as endurance more than conflict. The closing renunciation—pocketing the warm rag and leaving—lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ayla’s motive—to apprehend “the texture of time”—is clear and particular, and her tangential method governs her choices. The vision reframes Kael not as an antagonist but as a mirror across eras, earning her softened approach. The cost is subtle but felt: she relinquishes the heat of righteousness for vulnerability and continuity. A slight neatness to the epiphany via vision keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is embodied and particular from the first line, and her contradictory impulses—panic vs. wonder—play simultaneously in the sky sequence. Her arc from survival‑through‑avoidance to offering the doll is motivated by on‑page sensory revelation. The father’s presence applies pressure without eclipsing her agency. The epiphany is swift but earned by the tactile “petal” moment that reweights silence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is clear and drives purposeful, expert action. Interiority is present but largely serene; tension is externalized through the storm glass rather than internal contradiction. Micro‑choices (choosing the arch, striking the gondola) align with her competence. The piece would benefit from a sharper on‑page conflict or a visible cost beyond the implied solitude of her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his choices (mural decoding, the trek, the grab) align with it. Interiority is vivid but largely single‑vector; there’s little contradictory impulse on the page. Embodied emotion appears in tactile details (suit actuators, cold cascade), though the voice sometimes declares purpose rather than dramatizing ambivalence. The end renunciation of “keeper only” for “guide” is credible, if emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s purpose and method (“linking through scars”) are specific, embodied, and consistently motivate his choices, especially the wrist catch before the ring. The youth’s panic-to-steadiness progression is legible through breath and pain rather than labels. Interior contradiction is present in Kael’s tender ruthlessness, though the youth’s inner conflict is sketched more than deeply dramatized. The final endurance choice (accepting the burn) feels earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s skepticism from MLM trauma credibly collides with her itch to “poke the bear,” shaping the choice to volunteer the bolt rather than herself. Interiority is concrete (the sleeve sliced, the sub‑audible thrum, the stinging palm) and not generic. Her virtues and mischief align with the loophole she exploits, revealing character under pressure. The cost is mostly risk and moral caginess rather than loss, but it feels earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysander’s motive—to uncover a family truth—aligns with his “eloquently silent” temperament and drives each micro‑choice (finding the crank, maintaining the ritual rhythm). The contradiction of a “dynasty ender” seeking origin is alive on the page. Embodied restraint (steady crank, fixed attention) reveals character under pressure without therapy‑speak. Minor abstraction creeps in at “architecture of regret,” but it fits his contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Valerius’s motive—seeking “the shape of possibility” to move beyond guilt—is clear and deepens under pressure when the marionette becomes the queen. Embodied interiority (“joints protesting,” the clasp’s click) grounds emotion. The renunciation of the armor makes the change legible with cost. Slight ease in the turnaround once the queen appears keeps it shy of elite complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s grief and reverence are embodied (temples rubbed, dust motes, careful handling), and his micro‑choices—pausing over the button, deciding to scan the letter and button together—align with a believable internal shift. The contradiction between penance and purpose sits on the page and resolves credibly through the discovery. The emotional turn is earned by particulars, not assertion. A hair of neatness in the final reframe keeps it just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motives (holding the line against indifference) are clear and consistently drive choices: feigning a boot tie, casual ambling under drones, using the heirloom key. Interiority is embodied (cold key, buoyant auric water) and not generic. The competing impulses—fear/caution vs. purpose—coexist credibly. The final stance (slow, memory‑driven rebellion) feels earned, though the personal cost remains more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and continuous—she’s earned and upholds a generational duty. Interiority is specific (negative-space tactic, inherited counter-melody) and embodied (sweat from concentration, fatigue). Internal tension—fear that this is only a “temporary stay” against entropy—adds grit without melodrama. The visible cost is modest but present in the drained, bittersweet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (decode the leaves) and embodied actions (prodding with a twig; building shrines) reveal character. Interiority is textured but largely unopposed—contradictory impulses are faint, so the transformation costs little on the page. Still, her reverence-driven choice meaningfully alters her fate. The closing acceptance reads earned if emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s rigidity versus her growing willingness to improvise is cleanly dramatized through concrete choices: buying on the third Sunday, following the compass, and repairing the clock without a schematic. Embodied costs (numb fingers, cold water, mist) anchor her interior turn. The internal contradiction persists in scene and resolves credibly at the clock. Slight idealization at the end leans tidy but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s drive—redeeming a failure by testing the limits of her craft—feels specific and embodied, with the coin and foundry anchoring choices under pressure. Her balanced‑logic identity strains against guilt, producing credible micro‑choices (persuading water, forcing the furnace). The refusal to hug and the coin offered first reveal her hierarchy of values. A slight tilt toward aphorism in the courage speech nudges against messiness but remains earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive (to heal via laughter) is clear and consistent, and her modest courage reads in her choice to use dissonance rather than force. Kael’s confession supplies embodied emotion and a credible anchor in shame. The internal contradiction—compassion vs. causing discomfort with the harp—surfaces, though she meets little real pushback after the opening. One slightly declarative line (“That is all strength ever is.”) edges toward tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied, with contradictory impulses—rage versus a pursuit of mercy—coexisting under pressure. Micro-choices (hand to face, mapping pressure points, the meticulous disengaging of the strap) align with his proprioceptive curse and trauma history. The final stance (choosing grace as enacted calculus) feels earned by prior causality and carries cost. No stock therapy-speak; the specificity of bodily distress and learned responses makes him particular.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to honor overlooked histories and complete her grandmother’s work) is clear and consistently drives action. Interiority feels particular (“between‑worlds translator… of essences”) with tactile anchors (boots, warm glass), but contradictory impulses or real doubt under pressure are minimal. She solves the problem with high competence and little friction, softening felt cost. The final acceptance of role reads earned, if emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s vocation, rule against engagement, and compulsion to look up create a credible internal conflict that culminates in a costly, value‑driven choice. Embodied perception (dust as timeline, elevator tech eye) grounds his motives. The renunciation of his “never engage” rule reads earned and specific, not generic. Minor safety: the choice carries emotional cost, though practical repercussion remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s goal is crystalline and drives each act (uncorking, setting frost‑type, pulling the lever). Interiority is embodied through tactile craft rather than abstract labels, though true inner contradiction is muted—he’s mostly assured, not torn. The cost is credible: he sacrifices sterile perfection for living risk. A sharper on‑page hesitation at the lever might have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s drive is precise and particular—defunct revolutionary turned solitary reimaginer—and his micro‑choices (covering mirrors, holding the shard to storm‑light, translating via poem) align with that identity. The contradiction between craving proof and renouncing audience lands as a credible flaw. Embodied emotion is present via tactile ritual and object handling, not labels. The final acceptance of solitude reads as an earned renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s motive (reclaiming the stolen light) and flaw (truth‑sensitivity that weakens him) are clear and drive choices under pressure. His refusal to fight and pivot to “mending what isn’t torn” is character‑specific and earned. The Elian–Silas relationship sharpens the stakes and reveals status dynamics credibly. Slight reliance on summarized backstory trims depth of contradiction but doesn’t undercut the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s goal is clear and consistent, and his choices (descent, psychometry, plunge, relinquishing the compass) align with it. Interiority is sensuous and character‑particular (petrichor as vocation, the “hinged awakenings”). Internal contradiction is light—he proceeds with near‑serene conviction, so we don’t see much push‑pull under pressure. The renunciation at the end is earned and carries felt cost (risk and giving up the compass/collector impulse).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific—an artist solving a crisis through form, not force—and her agency drives the resolution. Embodied detail (tools, driftwood, knife) grounds her mindset. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from discovery to certainty with little doubt or competing impulse. The acceptance of long‑term guardianship lands conceptually but lacks an on‑page felt cost beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices (venturing to the cathedral; deciding to reinvent rather than merely repair) align with a coherent interior drive. The grandmother/postcard thread personalizes the want and reframes the emptiness. However, internal contradiction is muted; the reckoning arrives cleanly, with limited on‑page ambivalence or cost in the decision moment. The emotional shift feels earned yet tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and pressure‑tested: archivist rigor shifts into a rescue impulse once the retrocognitive shock hits. Embodied reactions (“searing reverie,” dropping the diary, scrambled collecting) feel particular and earned. Internal conflict—skepticism versus wild belief—registers in the doubt beat before she commits to parley. The flaw is minor: she adapts to the supernatural quickly, limiting deeper contradiction or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s aim and method are clear and consistent, and her refusal of “easy answers” motivates the shift from opening to invitation. Interiority is lyrical and particular (walking with the bottle, absorbing town echoes), but contradiction under pressure is light—she rarely struggles or missteps. Micro‑choices (refusing to “open” or wish; choosing to read) reveal values but with limited felt cost. Strong presence, modest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motives are precise and pressure-tested: oath-bound archivist turned would-be saboteur when her recording becomes an omen. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, the taste of chalk dust) and contradictory impulses collide convincingly at the climax. Micro-choices (needle adjustment, shaving the wax, deciding to smash, then freezing) reveal a hierarchy of values. The oath-versus-responsibility bind feels earned and costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation evolves credibly from preservation to “pour life back” and is embodied in precise, tactile actions. The refusal to step through the rift in favor of planting the acorn is a clean, character-driven choice. Internal contradiction is present but modest (temptation to escape vs. duty); the scene favors competence over struggle. A deeper crack in his resolve would raise the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s core drive—favoring listening over noise—consistently motivates her micro-choices (wiring the bell, refusing the lever). The internal tug between the “promising safety” of the switch and her trust in quiet lands as a credible contradiction. Interiority is specific (needles “screaming,” rope humming in her bones), not generic. Slight saintliness (near‑perfect calibration, minimal flaw cost) keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orion’s curiosity and reverent work ethic clearly motivate his choices, and his decision to invite the AI into the glass’s energy reads as earned. Interiority is specific (e.g., “borrowed catharsis,” “finding strength in vulnerability”), though true contradictory impulses are muted. The emotional cost is present but understated—he risks quarantine and relinquishes solitary ownership of the experience. The AI’s softening provides a relational crucible, but the pressure it exerts is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motives are coherent—he observes, infers, and finally takes custodial action—and his restraint aligns with “tranquilly perceptive.” Internal conflict is subtle (he cannot speak for them yet must act), but a true knife‑edge dilemma never quite materializes. The micro‑choices (following the gaze for days, cleaning the box, placing it in the sun) reveal values without sentimentality. The change is an earned renunciation/endurance: he accepts the burden of stewardship and forecloses speech as a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo’s motivation—recovering the “texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (conceiving the method, staging the stall, leaving the shard for last) align with that drive. The internal tension between resignation and the hope of being “rediscovered” reads credibly. Emotion is embodied through tactile ritual (thumb on glaze) and the bitter, expected disappointment. The final reconfiguration feels earned, though the cost remains primarily internal and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—tending brokenness into meaning—is enacted through concrete choices (wading in, binding the spar, weaving the feather). Interiority is conveyed through perception and ritual rather than stated emotion, fitting her temperament. The piece lacks pronounced contradictory impulses under pressure; she meets the moment with serene certainty. Still, the final renunciation (it will never fly) is credibly earned by her values.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and temperament (“final project brief,” “gently systematic”) are specific and consistent, and her choices (building the translator, initiating contact) align with them. The embodied cost appears in her thinning body and eventual death. Internal contradiction is light—her “brazen calm” leaves little friction beyond mortality—so complexity is more steady than combative. Still, the micro-choices under pressure read credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s skepticism and academically rebellious history drive concrete choices (walking the path with instruments, resisting the circle, reframing her research). Contradictory impulses register on the page: she moves to argue placebo, then can’t; she remains a scientist yet accepts “grace” as a quantifiable pursuit. Emotion is embodied through selective, character‑specific perception (“bronze quiet,” the warmth “the colour of aged metal”). The visible cost is a fissure in her core identity rather than a neat conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elros’s motive is crystalline and embodied in specific acts (bird-call reading, speaking dead tongues, seed casting). Interiority is textured if largely unwavering; there’s little contradictory impulse beyond a quiet endurance. The earned stasis—choosing patience and ritual over tech—carries conceptual cost. Slight limit: the piece avoids sharper internal friction that might deepen climax pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s motive—turning distance into closeness via sound—is vivid and consistent, and Argus’s role sharpens his choices. Interiority is particular (listening to the “shape” of static; the foil scribbles) and actions align with motive. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses; doubt or fear rarely complicate his certainty, softening the felt cost. Still, the final choice to leave reads earned by the accumulative decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s motive—transmuting isolation into purposeful exploration—is clear and consistent, progressing from nostalgic sketching to a committed new map. The internal contradiction (clinging to Earth’s skies vs. embracing the slow-time frontier) is dramatized through concrete micro-choices. Embodiment is credible (worklight, parchment, charcoal, the glinting applique) and reactions align with his pariah status. A few lines edge toward declarative summation, but the emotional turn is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motives are legible and consistent—chivalry versus thief’s reflex—culminating in the meaningful sacrifice of his fox trinket. Interiority is concise but specific (cold-numb hands, “cautious abandon”), and actions align with the stated code. The keeper’s status and playfulness pressure him credibly without flattening her into an antagonist. A touch more embodied strain at the decision point could deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interior is specific and lived-in—her “historian of small gestures” ethic and crisis-actor past credibly drive her pivot from witness to actor. The boy’s sleeve-picking is a concrete pressure that forces her values into choice. The aid she gives carries personal risk and a subtle moral cost, not just sentiment. The before/after in her stance is legible without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—finding the “shape of home”—is clear and drives concrete, tactile choices under pressure. Her contradictions (tormented by nightly truth yet persistent, tactile seeker) are embodied in the feather-guided navigation. The final endurance stance (truth persists; she reframes and bears it) is earned. A touch of stated realization (“Home was not a place of soft lies…”) edges toward explicitness, slightly smoothing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—atonement through competence—drives every choice, and his interiority stays embodied in tactile habits (the labyrinth, the tapestry) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses (self-punishment vs. reengagement) surface credibly as he shifts from passive warden to active decoder. The final renunciation of self-torment reads earned by prior causality. Slight softness remains in the visible on-page cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive—refracting a single truth into many—is clear, embodied (pigments, brushes of his own hair), and drives his decisive disruption. Fear and defiance coexist (“he hated the fear he saw there”), giving credible tension. The cost to him personally remains soft—little explicit social or physical pushback lands on him beyond the risk—so the change reads more catalytic than sacrificial. Still, micro‑choices (choosing canvas, dropping the brush, inviting the crowd) align tightly with his aim.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—conjure meaning against oblivion—drives coherent micro‑choices (examining the cog, deciding to embed a cherished keepsake). Fear, craft-rigor, and reverence for damage give her interiority a specific texture. The sacrifice of the mentor’s charm provides credible cost and reveals character under pressure. Slightly limited contradiction in-scene keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are coherent and specific: a habitual nostalgia that cages him until the cave encounter reactivates an old promise. His interiority is embodied through tactile perception (salt, stone, fungi) and micro‑choices (entering the crevice, taking/then replacing the shell). Contradictory impulses—attachment to the quay versus the urge to leave—coexist credibly. The renunciation (not returning to the quay) lands with felt cost scaled to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: Elias wants to prove a gentler method can save lives, rooted in witnessing Silas’s failed shouting. Interiority is embodied (“screaming tenderness,” the hum in the vial) and his doubt after “nothing happened” shows live contradiction under pressure. The final understanding feels earned by his risk and focus rather than declared epiphany. Cost is modest (spent vial, emotional strain) but legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—preserving culture as a response to loss—is clear and consistently drives every micro‑choice from jury‑rigging comms to repurposing scraps. Embodied emotion (“boots echoing,” “heart hammering”) keeps her present and specific. Internal contradiction is modest but present (grief as fuel vs. peace at closure). The final renunciation—accepting the station as tomb—feels earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive for silence is consistent, concrete, and forced into conflict by the eye’s seductive mono-focus. Contradictory impulses (rational forager vs. desperate seeker) act simultaneously in the storm beat. The involuntary truth trait manifests on the page and complicates her stance. The renunciation—use as tool not refuge—feels earned and forecloses an easier path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motive and methods are clear and particular (“curator of absence,” “observing gaps”), and his nightly descents and final relinquishment of the flower align with that psychology. The internal tension—devotion versus despair as interpretive frames—registers without overstatement. The brief relationship beat with the woman is understated but credible, with a clear status shift as he yields witness to her claim. Slight limitation: his struggle stays contemplative; few pressured micro-choices beyond the final offering.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s longing and competence are clear, and her “empirically intuitive” method feels character‑specific and embodied in micro‑choices (softening gaze, handling the matrix, trusting the ants). The loneliness and filial promise motivate action convincingly. The internal conflict is modest—she pivots to intuition without much resistance—so the epiphany risks tidiness. Still, her final acceptance reads earned by the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Isolde’s motive is clean and presses action—she dismisses guards, sheds robes, climbs, and chooses to enter the grotto. Fear and comprehension coexist in the grotto, giving the turn emotional texture beyond a tidy epiphany. The renunciation of her prior disenchantment lands as an earned endurance/acceptance rather than a flip. Slight neatness in the articulation of insight (“not a puzzle to be solved, but a language to be felt”) trims the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s drive (“capture the density of presence”) and her flaw (control reflex) are clear and dramatized. The relationship with Kael functions as crucible; his whisper pushes a real tactic shift. Interiority is specific to her craft and embodied in the way she handles heat and pattern. The epiphany lands a touch neatly, with limited on‑page cost beyond surrendering control.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—jealousy “of past selves” and the pull of “feral nostalgia” create contradictory impulses that act in scene. Her micro-choices (unrolling/snapping the scroll, fleeing the cabin, deciding to write) align with a coherent motive to impose narrative order. The turn from envy to weary awe reads earned through experience, not declared. The felt cost is relinquishing her controlling thesis about order.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and grief are embodied—anosmia grounds every noticing and drives her to Silas. Micro‑choices (going to the shop; choosing to touch the infant) reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction—professional identity built on scent versus learning to attend by touch and sound—reads cleanly. The epiphany leans tidy, but it’s earned by prior images (drip, screw, fog).

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform shame into strength and pass an exacting rite—remains clear and compels specific micro‑choices under pressure (pause, breathe, commit). Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (steam column, trembling hand, crystal bloom), with a credible contradiction between fear and focus. The child superstition becoming a deliberate technique reads earned by her history and current stakes, not a convenience. The change at the end forecloses a path (panic‑crystallization) in favor of a costlier, disciplined stance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (an overdue apology) is clear, embodied, and consistent with her past flaw (sensationalism). Interiority is particular to her craft and guilt, and actions (perfume memory, conducting-like pulling) align with motive. We get limited contradictory impulse on the page—she’s confident and contrite without much internal friction—which trims the ceiling. The visible cost is emotional exposure and letting go, credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and consistent, and his micro‑choices (selecting crystals, arranging the spiral, choosing a question over an answer) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or pays an embodied cost, so the arc reads serene rather than pressured. The “wanderingly exact” mode shows temperament but not genuine struggle. The end reconfigures his self‑understanding, yet the price of that shift is only softly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are crisply embodied—her panic tamped down into “fjord quiet” and the risky choice to invoke an archaic protocol under pressure read true. Internal contradiction is subtle (fear vs. duty), not overtly dramatized, keeping the arc credible but a touch tidy. Micro‑choices (diagnostics, unlocking, counting primes with micro‑adjustments) reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The ending stance feels earned though the personal cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s control-versus-surrender conflict is specific, embodied by the dead man’s switch and the mycelial mirror. Her competence in security and spatial thinking plausibly grounds the pivot toward “intelligent permeability.” The emotional cost of vulnerability is implied rather than viscerally felt, but the choice reads earned. The “familiar stranger” resolution threads back to her own work, deepening character without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: a probabilist following a gambler’s trail to understand him rather than condemn him. Micro-choices (lighting the lantern, deciding to follow the subway clues, going to the library) align with her internal drive. Emotions are textured (“clover melancholy,” complicated grief) without therapy-speak. The cost is primarily interior; a sharper on‑page dilemma would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s purpose and methods are vivid and consistent, and his micro‑choices (inviting the woman to “speak your piece,” deciding to connect callers, finally shutting off the disc) reveal character. The “cultivated estrangement” gives him a credible cost and flaw. Interiority is mostly implied rather than textured with contradictions in the moment, keeping the arc at Earned Stasis rather than deep change. The strangers are sketched effectively but remain functions of his vocation, not pressure on him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelin’s motive and method are clear and consistent, with embodied restraint (“gentle, thorough”) set against “haunted euphoria,” producing credible contradiction under pressure. Micro‑choices (steeping solution, prising the locket, withholding tears, choosing to hand the locket over) reveal hierarchy of values. The late arrival of the son adds a relational crucible that she meets with action, not speech. The son is lightly drawn but distinct enough for the beat’s needs.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, specific motives drive Elias’s choice to repurpose the moon rock into a communal anchor, and Clara’s need reads as a “gravity well” that credibly reorients him. Interiority is mostly filtered through action and image, though a few lines summarize states rather than embody them. The shift from jocularity to genuine warmth is earned and reveals contradiction. Minor lack of embodied struggle for Elias (the cost of opening his refuge) keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s motive is clear and specific—following resonance to the sorrow’s source—and his tactile way of knowing gives him a distinct interior life. The decisive choice not to draw a map but to saturate the ring instead reads earned. Internal contradiction is muted; he meets little resistance beyond endurance and the risk of being overwhelmed. Still, the embodied overwhelm at the tree and the renunciation of cartographic habit register as credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive—to sift meaning from chaos—is embodied in concrete micro‑choices (switching to logs, scratching digits, smearing blood, risking remaining power). Her “confidently uncertain” trait manifests under pressure without tidy self‑help gloss. Internal tension (frustration vs. methodical reframing) reads credible, though the personal cost beyond energy expenditure is mostly conceptual. A bit more embodied jeopardy would sharpen the change’s felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to translate silence into music is specific, embodied (the film‑less camera; the pang when the yacht tears the water), and her pivot from mapping to conducting reads as a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is textured and character‑particular, not generic. The old court‑advisor instinct resurfaces and motivates the central choice. Slightly limited by the absence of deeper flaw friction or a sharper internal contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation—honoring a dying mentor and protecting the “forgotten promise”—drives concrete choices. Interiority is character‑particular (“volcanic tenderness”) and embodied in tactile acts (making and erasing art). Internal conflict (reveal vs protect) tightens credibly at the door and resolves in an earned renunciation. A touch more friction or fallibility under pressure could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—protecting the shared memory against institutional erasure—is clear and embodied through her rebellious drumming. Interiority is specific (jaw tension, deliberate slowness) and actions align with her quietly defiant stance. The contradiction between prescribed compliance and chosen transgression is live in-scene. The final cost—remaining separated while keeping the entanglement—reads as an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s competence, creed, and sensory specialization are vividly established and her choices align with them under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little genuine micro‑conflict beyond prudence vs. exposure. The unsanctioned risk and quiet daring register, but the felt personal cost remains light. Her dynamic with the Port Master flickers intriguingly yet doesn’t fully pressure her values in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are crystal clear and drive her tactics under strain, and her micro‑choices (abandoning sun‑reflections, opening to the void, switching to starlight) align with character. The embodied calm under pressure reads particular, not generic. Internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers—which trims depth. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned though the personal cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and consistent—transforming gentle hope into a need for symbolic, communal defiance—and his tenderness with Elara humanizes him under pressure. Internal contradiction is limited; he moves fairly directly from resolve to action, with little friction. Still, embodied emotion (“cradled her… like a cherished idea”) and small, purposeful choices ground him. Elara’s presence sharpens his role as caretaker-turned-organizer without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s longing, tactile reactions (“a deep thrum…in the marrow”) and micro‑choices (taking the skiff, dropping the scrimshaw) create a coherent arc from duty to renunciation. The internal conflict is present (“final tether…mental severing”) but resolves with relative smoothness once the call arrives, minimizing friction. Emotions are embodied and character‑specific, though the realization borders on tidy epiphany in places. The final renunciation reads earned and costs him his community and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied: the knife, pine, and bouquet reveal a man curating absence while performing at himself. Contradictory impulses are active on the page—he clings to ritualized silence yet is pierced by protectiveness at the lavender’s fall. His choice to stop whittling and weave a bird is an earned renunciation with cost to his constructed hush. The “morally ambiguous” self‑frame lands through action rather than label.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—returning to fuse with the forbidden hum—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (approach, restraint, surrender). The internal conflict between literal paraphrase and dissolution is credible and enacted, not summarized. The change at the end (becoming a conduit) is earned, though the felt cost remains subtle (a renunciation of old methods rather than a painful sacrifice). Absence of an external counterforce limits pressure on her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s drive—to find beauty without color—is concrete and embodied (texture, heat, energy) and motivates the risky barter. Her doubt about her work’s value plays credibly against her stubborn vocation. Interiority is particular (topography of “Ashes,” sensing heat as silver) rather than generic. Internal contradiction is present but modest; there’s little on‑page resistance after the offer, so pressure on her choice remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation and flaw are clear: mastery vs. vulnerability, control vs. surrender. Her micro‑choices (lifting the lens, stepping into the chamber, choosing to “converse” with sounds) reveal a credible internal shift. Embodied detail—cool weight of glass, breathlessness at the end—grounds feeling. The change is earned, though the final articulation edges toward tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—grief hollowed her work until curiosity and legacy pull her forward. Interiority is specific to her craft and loss, with concrete choices (following coordinates, placing the stencil, peering through the lens). The contradictory impulses—numb resignation versus a “subdued ardor”—operate on the page. The concluding stance feels earned, though the emotional struggle is relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is coherent and active: curiosity harnessed to map cultural patterns drives her to repurpose cartomancy into forensic problem‑solving. Interiority is specific (measuring angles of cards, quoting her grandmother) and actions align with her values. The relationship with Mr. Gable shifts status credibly from skeptical landlord to collaborator. The inner contradiction—esoteric toolset deployed for practical repair—adds texture without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (forbidden knowledge) is clear and intensifies under pressure, and her contradictory impulses—rapt longing for dissolution versus clinging to flawed selfhood—are dramatized in the touch-and-snatch beat at the pagoda. Interiority is embodied (“atoms of nostalgia” stinging eyes, veil heavy) and her exit choice forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor hedge: her final resolution is swift, though earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motive—to “preserve the shape of hope”—is clear, character‑particular, and drives her choices through the investigation to the containment decision. Interiority is vivid (“luminous regret” as a felt sensation) and reactions to the stone/shadow reveal her under pressure. The final renunciation—choosing containment and self‑risk over curation—reads earned. Slight limitation: little on‑page contradiction beyond duty vs self‑preservation; she remains largely competent without a messy misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior conflict—anger and self‑protection versus reflexive compassion—plays out through tactile micro‑choices at the bench, not just labels. The chameleon and its tail tip externalize his motives without therapy‑speak. His final stance (be more careful, not less gentle) is earned by prior beats and costs him the illusion of Ben. A touch of overt self‑assessment (“This was the balance”) slightly tidies what could remain more ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aveline’s drive—to seek closure by reopening wounds—plays out in concrete, character‑specific ways (coffee rings as micro‑reading, scars as macro‑text). Contradictory impulses coexist: compulsion to probe vs. the migraine‑like cost of plant telepathy. The displaced miracle revelation credibly reconfigures her belief and leads to the earned, risky act of unwrapping. Emotions are embodied (throb, tremble, shake) and choices align with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to locate where unused love is stored—is clear and governs her choices (touching the film, entering the memory, deciding to project). Interiority is specific (psychometry filtered through tactile details), though internal contradiction is minimal, with little friction between caution and compulsion. The grief-suffused tenderness reads embodied rather than labeled. The closing act (projecting the film) feels earned by the prior discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it throughout. Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. The exhaustion/melancholy at the end reads as cost but not as a contested choice under pressure. The arc culminates credibly in surrender to rest, though the struggle feels more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and her actions align: she patrols to stabilize volatile fragments and chooses persuasion over force. Interiority is evocative but skews abstract; we feel her patience more than a live contradiction. The “dreamless” aspect hints at cost yet remains under‑dramatized. A modest endurance/change lands as credible duty rather than a wrenching choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s drive (to “rediscover the wild frontier of your mind”) is clear and consistent, and the surrender of the gear provides a credible on‑page cost. Interiority is sensorial and specific (ozone on tongue, tuned to wind), but conflict is low-friction; the fix feels largely intuitive rather than contested. The final shift from stray to “home” is earned, if slightly tidy. A sharper internal contradiction or moment of doubt under pressure would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, with embodied fear easing into tentative agency; the toll scene force-tests her with a concrete, vulnerable act. Contradictory impulses appear at the hesitation before offering her story. The guides are archetypal but function as pressure rather than padding. The change—moving from seeking a place to carrying a choice—feels earned at this length, with an emotional (if gentle) cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s motivation—testing the bargain of safety against the loss of voice—grounds every choice, from the seventh‑step ritual to the final refusal “He would not remain.” Interiority is embodied through tactile beats (the bolt’s weight, the handprint fit) and a credible internal contradiction (healing body vs. imprisoned spirit). The final act (silent chord) earns his renunciation. Minor on‑the‑nose phrasing skirts didacticism but doesn’t undercut character truth.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied in meticulous actions (ink pellet, marginalia), and the confrontation shows calm competence under pressure. Interiority is elegant but restrained; we feel little contradictory impulse or frayed emotion in the peak beat. The relationship dynamic with the pretender is legible but brief. The endurance/renunciation cost is implied more by epochal patience than by an on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—witnessing loss yet compelled to seek the paths that endure—is specific, embodied in the tapping habit and the reef memories. Her micro-choices (cross‑referencing data, assembling a kit, undertaking the voyage) align cleanly with that drive. The internal contradiction (moored to grief, drawn toward hope) is credible and pays off in the final charged poise. Slight softness remains in the lack of resistance or error under pressure, keeping the arc a touch friction‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—seeking meaning and connection versus blasters—and her embodied fear (trembling, teeth‑bone pressure) sharpens her choice. The “awkwardly confident” contradiction reads on the page and informs action. Internal conflict is present but light; the cost of her choice remains implied more than dramatized. Still, her micro‑choices (focus adjustments, stepping into the node, receiving rather than commanding) coherently reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—quietly evolving tradition—consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to decode and unseal. Interiority is specific (plant-murmur perceptions; the “burden and a promise”) but internal contradiction is mild, with little on‑page hesitation once the method appears. The secrecy about her gift and acceptance of enabling rather than controlling add texture. The final renunciation (to enable, not command) feels earned, though the cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—soil, glass, fern, breath—so her motives and coping method read lived-in rather than labeled. Contradictory impulses act in scene: the photo both drags her under and, later, is exhibited and weighted, signaling a costly endurance. Micro‑choices under pressure (unclenching fingers, choosing tactile anchors, turning to water) reveal hierarchy of values. The final Earned Stasis is credibly earned by prior causality and shows visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to descend or be crushed—intensifies credibly, and her artist’s sensibility guides tactile, particular micro‑choices (which threads to follow or release). Interiority is embodied (dust, cold mercury, pressure) rather than labeled. The contradiction—fear vs. intuitive rightness—plays on the page without therapy‑speak. Slight tidiness in the final calibration of resolve keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s motive (“to discover why time slows in crisis”) is clear and drives concrete choices (staying, experimenting with water). Interiority is specific (serene anger, albino sensitivity) and embodied through attention to wind‑carved stone and ink. The change from hunter’s anger to a calm participant in the pattern reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but light; most pressure is conceptual rather than psychologically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s duty-versus-truth conflict is specific and embodied (trembling hands, breath plume) and results in a decisive, costly act. Her “blink” choice is grounded in prior setup (silence as currency; archivist role), not a contrivance. Interiority remains character‑particular, avoiding therapy‑speak. A hair more visible resistance or consequence could deepen the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear: she craves peace yet chooses to risk it to honor her father’s ethic. The embodied ritual with the sandbag scrap grounds her interiority in concrete action. The moment of temptation to destroy the chip versus carrying it shows simultaneous conflicting impulses. Slight safety in the moral frame—she reads more virtuous than flawed—but the choice still carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Nereus’s cool-headed resolve is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (zigzag navigation, deploying the spike, “voicing” silence) align with motive. Interiority is economical but specific—accepting fear without letting it in—though contradiction is minimal and the struggle feels smooth. The reconfiguration at the end (carrying the echo’s grief) reads as a credible cost. Slight under-tension in his competence keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Viola’s drive (truth-seeking) and flaw (intellectualizing under pressure) are specific and embodied—the metallic taste, the pen nib’s weight, the telescope as “judge.” Her internal contradiction (profit/expediency vs. truth) operates simultaneously and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost (boring page‑five corrective). Minor safety lies in how smoothly rational the decisioning is; struggle remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to hush the “dissonance of old guilt”—is specific and consistently drives each choice, culminating in the decision to bind rather than erase. Interiority is vivid and embodied through tools and textures (amber, copper, firmware). The internal contradiction (yearning for silence vs. acceptance of a ghosted self) is dramatized in the binding act. Cost registers as integration of guilt, not its removal.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks meaning post‑Unlearning through tactile, specific choices (mandala, tile, scattering). Interiority is sensorial rather than labeled, with credible urgency and a quiet contradiction (whimsy vs. fear of frivolity). The philosopher’s brief pressure reveals her values without derailing the single‑POV focus. The final renunciation (scattering) feels earned and character‑specific, if emotionally gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kaelen’s motive—“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”—drives concrete choices (prying the tessera, scanning it, broadcasting and renaming). He reads as a particular mind with tactile, embodied moments (heavy gloves against delicate art; breathless surfacing). Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal; he’s largely resolved rather than torn, though his “retrocognitively trapped” state implies cost. The final stance (renaming with evidence) is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (refusing to be a monument to tragedy and demanding an encore) is clear, character‑specific, and drives action. Interiority is embodied via synesthesia and the tactile tarot coin, with a credible internal pivot from resisting fractures to weaving them. The cost—accepting her death into the tapestry rather than erasing it—reads on the page. Minor limitation: conflict remains largely internal, with limited contradictory impulses dramatized in discrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s “affectionate skeptic” stance motivates the pill decision cleanly, and his tactile focus reads embodied and particular. The internal contradiction (skepticism vs need) is present but lightly tested—the pill works almost immediately, minimizing struggle. Somatic sensations and craft details reveal character under pressure. The final choice feels earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and particular—he seeks to be “the voice of the unknown”—and his actions (examining the fossil, interfacing it with the device, consenting to become a vessel) align. Interiority is textured through sensory perception rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is slight—he feels “not afraid,” so pressure never exposes competing impulses. The final stance shift (from map-maker to medium) lands but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear desire (not to stop the end but to reconfigure it) and steady, purposeful agency ground the Turnkey. Interiority is specific (sorting by resonance, hands calloused), but contradictory impulses are minimal, so tension stays gentler than it could. Her decisive act (placing the obsidian button) is motivated and earned by the cataloging work. The felt cost is mostly endurance/time; moral trade-off remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character‑specific—burn scars, the pillbox tic, and his “prudently daring” caution all translate into on‑page micro‑choices. His contradictory impulses (self‑exile vs. compulsion to intervene) operate simultaneously and culminate in a costly decision. The brief exchange with the runner adds relational pressure without diluting POV. Minor risk: his instant code‑fluency flirts with competence ease but remains plausible for his background.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation (to keep an oath and distill the land’s complexity) is vivid and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (waiting, listening, stitching). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (horses, gutters, fog). The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or visible internal friction, so the change is more endurance than conflict. Still, the final renunciation of haste reads earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to understand the oasis’s resistance) is clear and embodied through tactile labor and small compassionate acts. Her interiority is concrete and character‑particular, but internal contradiction is minimal, keeping pressure modest. The change—shifting from observer to maintainer—feels earned, though the on‑page cost is mostly time and intention rather than a sharper sacrifice. Micro‑choices (water for lizards, mending a wall, pressing intention into clay) reveal values effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—to reflect light into dark corners—is concrete and plays through her micro-choices (aerating the lavender, angling the mirror). Her interiority is embodied via the inherited gauge and fire-escape constraints, with a credible acceptance of limits. The protected vulnerability is felt, though her internal contradiction could tighten with a sharper cost on the page. Still, action and motive align and produce a believable, modest reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—translating isolation into independence—is clear and consistently embodied, with tactile stress (“vibrating in her teeth”) and a live fear of shattering under ancestral memory. The choice to descend at low tide and place the sundial reads as a credible, pressure‑shaped act. Internal contradiction (terror of brittle awakenings vs. decisive ritual) is present without therapy‑speak. The cost—remaining alone while accepting the ghosts—feels earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s yearning to “find the thread that connects all things” is clear and drives her choices from discovery to creation to offering. Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and craft actions rather than labels. The internal conflict—feeling hollow and disconnected—resolves credibly via her installation, though the on‑page cost remains soft. A slightly tidier emotional arc limits the sense of contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s cautious hope versus her decision to break protocol creates credible internal tension, and her embodied work (fingers on charts, exhaustion) grounds motive under pressure. The choice to “interfere” aligns with her suspicion-driven drive to outwit manipulators. Cost is present but light—professional/ethical breach and battered hope rather than a sharper personal loss. Leo’s role appropriately supports rather than dilutes her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobic urge to flee versus disciplined training—operate simultaneously and drive her decisive act with the compass. Interiority is embodied (air like tar, knuckles white) and choices track to her “prudently adventurous” nature. The final reweighting from prison to promise reads earned, with a credible emotional cost. The only softness is a faintly tidy self-summation in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ellis’s prosopagnosia and methodical temperament create a credible internal conflict that turns when he touches the ribbon and allows feeling to temper technique. The shift from “machine of synthesis” to seeking the person behind features is earned and embodied. Slight neatness in the final self‑narration (“I drew who she was”) trims complexity but doesn’t undercut motivation. The cost—risking his reliable method and exposing vulnerability—is felt if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—her tremor vs steady voice is a sharp contradiction that persists under pressure. Micro‑choices (forcing the hatch, parsing codes, descending to the nail) align with values and escalate credibly. The cost of taking on his mandate lands, though her inner conflict skews noble and could risk a touch of inevitability. A bit more flaw‑driven hesitation at the pull would add grit.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) aligns with concrete choices: interrogating details, decoding the glass, and following the map. Interiority is embodied (ozone, cold metal, trembling) and character‑specific (hyper‑observant recall). The change feels earned by his agency, though the ending leans a shade tidy. Minimal friction or contradictory impulse under pressure slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ash’s hunger to understand his father versus his cultivated stillness creates a credible internal tension, and his final micro‑choice—snapping the satchel shut—reads as earned. Interiority is concrete (the carvings, the money, the satchel) and mapped to action. The old man’s presence sharpens Ash’s motive without overwhelming his agency. Minor softness: Ash’s turmoil could surface with one more embodied crack under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief, stubborn curiosity, and word‑healing gift are integrated into concrete choices: choosing a lucid dream, then rejecting the academic paper for a healing narrative. The internal contradiction—she can heal others but not herself—adds pressure without melodrama. Cost is present but understated (foregoing traditional scholarly credit and accepting the burden). Interiority is specific and tactile (“mantle of leaden stars”), avoiding therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivations are clear and consistent—heal the lake without becoming what she fights—and they sharpen under pressure at the bargain. Interiority is embodied (the burning seed, the tug of lost objects) and her refusal costs her pain and the acceptance that the lost remain lost. The contradictory impulse—temptation to “unbend” versus strict code—acts in scene and determines the climax. Minor tell-phrases surface but do not undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s contradictory impulses—“dread and desperate hope,” anxious elation tempered by resolve—are embodied and drive specific choices. Her root‑binding scars and the covenant concretize motive and constraint, not just label them. The final self‑wounding reads as an earned, costly act. Slight overclarity in naming purpose (“her life’s work”) trims mystery but not credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s reckless idealism is specific, embodied, and motivates each turn; the cold void after snatching the card viscerally registers cost. Her interior contradiction (seize/change vs. accept/balance) is enacted rather than told. The renunciation—offering her “brightest, most impossible dream”—reads earned and alters her future with felt loss. Silas applies steady counter‑pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—shame as a “metallic taste,” the reflex to inventory texture as defense. Contradictory impulses (fact-insulation vs. felt grief) operate in-scene and motivate his actions. The final stance is earned through the letters and unfinished song, though the acceptance lands a touch neatly. Minor risk of tidy epiphany slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s grief‑driven need to decode “transition” is clear and consistent, and his kindly methodical nature shapes both his error (trying to force) and his remedy (a deliberate release). The internal contradiction—control vs acceptance—surfaces in the cuneiform insight and is resolved through a costly renunciation. Emotions are embodied through tactile anchors (warm seed, ironwood hum) rather than labels. A hair of telling at the epiphany (“required acceptance, not force”) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s fear-to-acceptance arc is cleanly motivated and embodied (the tears under the luminous cocoon), and the Librarian’s ethos is consistent and active. Interiority is concise but specific, with the core contradictory impulse dramatized rather than told. The relationship dynamic is legible—calm mentor pressure versus novice trepidation—and it meaningfully alters Elian’s stance. Slight limitation: Elian’s struggle is brief, with minimal resistance beyond initial awe.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and interiority are clear and specific—the Geiger clicks, the tactile pearl, and the “heartbeat of a hesitation” ground her choice. The conduit realization risks neatness but is earned by the confession and sensory transfer. Contradiction is present (guarded professional vs. vulnerable collector), though lightly dramatized. The final act—surrendering the pearl—aligns with her stated drive and shows credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive and method are sharply etched, with concrete motive (self-forgiveness) embodied through tactile, goal-driven actions. Interiority is specific (“torrent,” “dammed,” steady hand vs churn) and reactions to objects (graffiti, accordion, map) reveal her worldview. The change—choosing to walk the river rather than merely map it—feels earned. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but mild; she rarely wavers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑particular, and her actions under pressure—speaking “I am afraid,” choosing to document, and lifting the veil—align with her contradictions. The fear/compulsion tension gives embodied stakes without therapy‑speak. The final acceptance reads earned by prior beats, with a felt cost in relinquishing the veil’s protection. Minor note: her leap to “document the process” is swift but seeded by the code’s behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific, embodied, and motive-driven; her pull between preservation and complicity culminates in a charged, value-revealing choice. The mulberry’s “ache” works as both pressure and mirror, sharpening her contradiction. Her final tactic—weaponizing empathy—aligns with her provenance-trained patterning and plant telepathy. The cost (personal risk and potential loss of the tree) is legible at the point of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and her ritual choices align with her values. The moment she halts breath/heart provides embodied cost. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little moral or emotional friction beyond the technical risk. The piece leans reverent competence over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, shifting credibly from “peace” to “understanding” under pressure. Interiority is distinct and embodied (tree climbing, the cool weight of the hairpin), with the key reversal—seeing herself as the betraying sister—earning the change. A few abstract formulations (“source of contentment,” “absolute understanding”) flirt with thesis-speak but remain grounded by tactile action. The final forgiveness of self feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior conflict—professional absolver vs. seeker of her own conscience—is concrete and dramatized through micro‑choices (not deploying the shard as usual, asking the real‑mirror question, then offering the shard). Her embodied doubt (cloak weight) and professional tics (“sincerely insincere”) feel particular. The client’s flicker of doubt provides relational pressure that forces her stance. The cost—refusing a lucrative job and relinquishing her habitual role—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to teach “vanishing to appear”—is clear and enacted through withholding, the stone toss, and the revelation of her reverse age. Kaelen’s frustration and attention shift give the relationship a live crucible without melodrama. The internal cost is subtle (relinquishing the desire to “find” silence) and lands, though it remains largely conceptual. A touch more embodied struggle from Kaelen under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zephyr’s motivation is precise and coherent, and her renunciation—choosing to move despite a vow to master stillness—lands as a credible, character-driven cost. Interiority is particular to her vocation (listening, mapping, treating dust as archive). A touch more embodied stress in the climb/pry beat could deepen felt stakes. Still, desire, adaptation, and earned shift are all aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices—pursuing the light, mist walking, and bracing the ice—align under pressure. Interiority is mostly embodied through tactile cold, breathlessness, and the felt ache for wonder. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses in-scene. The final renunciation feels earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motive—finding the color of sound—drives every choice, culminating in the risky dives and the interpretive leap with the key. His guarded solitude vs. obsessive quest gives him a credible contradiction that tightens at the porthole and the desk. Emotions are embodied through tactile tasks (lighting, polishing, wading, coughing) rather than labels. The change at the end is earned, though the cost remains mostly internal and lightly physical.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alaric’s motive—preserve a single frequency with integrity—drives each micro‑choice, from handling the coins to rejecting the “peace” coin after the backwards prophecy. Interiority is specific (the coins’ tactility; the shard biting into his palm) and his doubt actively reshapes tactics. The contradiction between quiet enthusiasm and desperate focus lands credibly under pressure. Visible cost arrives as renunciation of safety (peace) and the painful, risky self‑insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—his longing refocuses into the project of naming—and the duty/Yearning tension gives him contradictory impulses that act in scene. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (stylus, brass grooves) and the choice to use light as love’s remaining vocabulary. The final endurance—heartbreak transformed but not erased—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. A slight limitation: he meets little resistance beyond internal pressure, which keeps the struggle elegant but contained.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s interiority is specific—“brittle devotion,” “lukewarm power”—and his micro-choices under pressure (shifting tactics from force to patient rhythm) reveal character. The hairline crack of despair and the embodied synchronizing of breath to drips show credible contradiction. His final endurance and collapse to his knees register a felt cost. A secondary relational crucible is absent, but not required at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motives are specific and consistent, and his reversal from planned erasure to preservation grows organically from the photo‑trail to his late wife’s inscription. Contradictory impulses—warden vs citizen—are dramatized rather than told. Embodied detail (the bottle’s glass, the mud flats, his measured gait) grounds feeling. The pivot flirts with tidiness but earns itself through concrete, personal cues.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s goal and inner split between rational rigor and hidden sentiment are clear and operational under pressure. Her “terrifying faith” choice at the flame beat credibly fuses those impulses. Embodied reactions (hammering heart, cold as comfort) anchor emotion in the body. The only softness is a slightly tidy articulation of her insight at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s motive (preserve Elias’s trust) is clear and drives every action, and her competence under stress reads specific to her. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or hesitation on the page to deepen complexity. Embodied detail (hands flying, hiss of background) grounds emotion without therapy‑speak. The final choice forecloses her watch but the personal cost could be felt more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive (to end numbness) is clear and his micro-choices—selecting and pairing antithetical memories—show contradictory impulses in action. The “apathy as a wall” line risks a touch of diagnosis, but it’s grounded by immediate tactic change and cost. Isao’s pressure is minimal but catalytic. The final acceptance reads earned through accumulated struggle rather than a sudden flip.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to safeguard innovation—drives every choice, and her decision to plant the seed crystallizes her values. Interiority is specific enough, with tactile actions (walking to the brook, burying the seed) grounding her. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates, so visible struggle feels muted. Still, competence and cunning reveal character credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s motive—restoring laughter—drives every choice, and his “mournfully eager” contradiction reads on the page in the gentling of violent sound. Embodied details (calloused palm, voice shredded, fuel sputter) keep emotion concrete. Internal conflict is subtle but present: he uses brute noise to make space for tenderness. The closing walk toward his wife signals a credible, costly shift from isolation to shared tending.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied (ink-and-leather longing against hoarfrost), with a credible contradiction between feral displacement and librarian duty. Her choice to mend the seam rather than go home is clearly motivated and costs her something she deeply wants. Micro-choices (picking up the pendant, reframing waiting as intent) reveal values under pressure. A touch of stated thesis (“preference”) trims ambiguity but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies from revulsion at preservation to the decisive refusal to mend and the choice to annihilate the crozier. Interiority is specific (“mask of granite patience over a deep well of feeling”) and actions align with the shift in stance. The internal contradiction—duty-bound custodian vs. yearning creator—operates in-scene and culminates in a credible renunciation. The cost is implied (sacrilege/defiance of mandate) rather than faced, slightly tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear drive and competence anchor Elara, and her creed motivates concrete, on-page choices. Interiority is particular (“She didn't perform magic; she calibrated it”), with embodied sensation (hair rising) under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she adapts smoothly with little visible emotional cost. The ending’s change feels earned but ethically or personally untested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Felix’s motivation is clean and consistent—save the commuters from being “unwritten”—and his occupational confidence reads credibly under pressure. The resilient positivity is dramatized (steadying the crowd, choosing hope as signal) rather than merely labeled. However, internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles or pays an emotional price on the page beyond the closing awareness. The endurance at the end (keeper of the threshold) lands, but the cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her competence reads convincingly through action (“each loop and knot was a calculated decision”). Interiority is present but largely functional; she experiences little on‑page friction or contradiction while executing her craft. Arthur’s arrival adds an emotional mirror but not real pressure on her choices. The change lands, but without a tested conflict inside Elara, the arc feels more assured than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—measured curiosity turns into disciplined action—and her choices (pressing the link, studying, transmitting the plot) align with it. Interiority is specific (“a cage,” “balancedly curious”) and embodied, if a touch idealized. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely struggles or risks beyond professional renunciation. The final stance shift (from benthic instructor to stellar navigator-teacher) feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to safeguard “vulnerable voices”—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (tracking, interpreting, deciding to speak back) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her vocation, though true contradiction or risk to self is muted. The promise to tell the daughter hints at cost but remains largely conceptual. Still, the character reads particular and embodied within the pressure window.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s fear is embodied and specific (the “cold, metallic taste,” the tightening chest), and her vow to “stand by the unremembered” credibly drives choices under pressure. The tunnel crawl is a clean micro‑test of motive versus phobia. Her conceptual shift—witness over data—feels earned by the translation experience. A slight leap in her rapid grasp of “phase transitions” trims the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive (to fetch wisdom from failure) is coherent and expressed through concrete, idiosyncratic behaviors—the heartbeat counting and the porcelain shard. Contradictory impulses—mercy versus persistence through Julian’s pain—surface in the “It hurts” exchange and her continued work. Micro‑choices (tracing the shard, anchoring to pain) reveal values under pressure. The relationship with Julian functions as a crucible without neat moral cover.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive—preserving a dead language by translating texture into sound—is clear and particular, and her restraint and listening competence feel earned. The internal conflict crests when she nearly throws the diamond and chooses endurance, a decision that reveals values and cost. Embodied cues (the copper veins humming; the diamond biting her palm) ground emotion. Minor exposition blocks don’t dilute her specificity or the credibility of the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s shift from detached researcher to participant is motivated by the confessions and the charged garden, culminating in the embodied choice to throw the arrowhead. Interiority is specific and textured (the arrowhead as “tool of division” against a connective field) with credible contradiction between duty and empathy. The renunciation of her foundation’s mission carries a felt conceptual cost, though the personal risk remains abstract. Elara’s brief presence adds pressure without diluting the single‑POV arc.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive—to reawaken beauty—is clear and consistently drives his flight, tactics, and final risky act. Interiority is embodied (bone‑felt tremor, sterile air, copper coins) and his contradictory impulses (panic vs. insistence on beauty) play simultaneously at the peak. His choices escalate credibly: from performance to flight to a dissonant strike to sacrificing the locust shell. Minor mythic framing is concise and fuels present action rather than replacing it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motive and stance are vivid—“respectfully rebellious” is dramatized in his uniformed defiance and refusal to run. Micro-choices under pressure (producing the bottle, urging speed, standing in the searchlight) align with an ethic of quiet resistance. Interiority is mostly shown through action and image, with only light tell at the end. The cost is felt as ongoing risk rather than a single sacrifice, but it suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation and ethos are sharply etched, and her tactile, workmanlike reverence for broken joy feels particular. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she meets the moment with competence and serenity rather than any visible struggle. The choice to “offer silence” lands, but it exacts little cost or resistance. The result is strong but not transformative characterization at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is precise and sustained, and her choices (the ritual walk, handling the scarf) align with a long‑tended obsession. Interiority is textured through concrete sensory cues (“holding a sigh,” “specific silence”), but internal contradiction is light—she rarely resists or doubts. The change at the end (“reawakened her own”) lands, though the on‑page cost of that pursuit remains mostly implied. Absence of a human counterforce limits crucible pressure on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s desire to “capture a runaway dream” is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (taking the palette to the lighthouse, painting the dawn, then choosing to photograph it) align with that motive. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is minimal; there’s little felt risk or competing impulse at the peak, which slightly flattens the arc. The final relief reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysander’s motive (liberating ideas from fear) is distinct and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (leading her outside; choosing to speak about the ribbon). The woman’s fear is embodied enough to register (the tear, the weight of the relic) though her interiority is mostly inferred rather than directly felt. The emotional turn—reframing shame as grief—lands credibly with some cost. However, contradictory impulses on the woman’s side remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation (recover a “stolen” memory) is clear, embodied, and drives concrete actions under pressure (cold, hours of searching, fading light). His interiority feels particular—“studying broken constellations” as lens—and the reversal from theft to guardianship lands as an earned reconfiguration of belief. Internal contradiction (resentment vs. wonder) is present but could be sharper on the page before the turn. The final acceptance feels credible and paid for by years of misbelief and present physical hardship.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motives (decipher terms, suspect the artifact) and his “combative tenderness” are clear, embodied in backward pacing, brusque instruction, and the final renunciation. The apprentice’s arc from failure to insight is credible and earned, though interiority remains mostly externalized. Status dynamics are legible in their teacher–apprentice exchanges. The closing trade—freedom for stewardship—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystal clear and rooted in vocation; her tactile relationship to trees and color reads particular. Under pressure we get endurance more than contradiction—little in-scene ambivalence or morally fraught trade-offs. Micro-choices (gathering essences, deciding to pour in her own hope/creativity) align with her traits. The cost is felt as soul-drain, but we don’t see a path definitively foreclosed beyond spent energy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (grounding spirits through restoration) is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially persisting through dread to unravel the final knot. Embodied interiority (“cold dread in her fingers,” “phantom taste of salt”) avoids label‑speak. Internal contradiction—fear vs. duty—registers, though it could press harder against a real temptation to stop. The earned shift from tremor to steadiness at the end reads credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and perceptual signature are vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (isolating the shadow, choosing to whisper rather than force) align with a character defined by empathic attention. Internal contradiction is mild—she rarely wavers under pressure—so the arc feels more assured than contested. Embodied emotion lands in tactile details (palms on cold stone, thrum of heartbeat), avoiding generic labels. The final refusal to immediately descend reads as a credible earned stasis, if with a subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and her interiority is grounded in tactile action (gloved hands, sealed note). The quiet compulsion versus professional discipline creates a credible internal pressure. The culminating acceptance feels earned by prior beats, though the visible cost is more conceptual than visceral. A touch more contradictory impulse under stress could deepen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—giving voice to unspoken systems—drives concrete choices under pressure, and her embodied focus (hands on the cold bolt plate, timing the window) reads lived-in. The heirloom’s use reveals value hierarchy without exposition. Internal contradiction is mild (devotion vs. risk), so the portrait leans assured rather than torn. Still, the final acceptance—singing for an audience of one—lands as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s curiosity, duty, and grief braid persuasively, and her micro‑choices—examining the goggles, angling the light, choosing to read then still deliver—track cleanly with her traits. Interior sensation (chilled fingers, the groan of gears) grounds emotion without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction (steward vs. discoverer/keeper) is present but mild; pressure never forces a sharp, costly renunciation. Still, the final stance—keeper of meaning rather than mere courier—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular (finishing her father’s “aerian psychology” and proving the sky remembers), and under pressure she makes specific micro‑choices (drop–recover telescope, resume cataloging, final classification). The internal conflict between panic and trained focus is embodied (“hands shaking,” “numb fingers,” thin air) rather than labeled. The earned renunciation at the end—putting down tools and accepting drift—reads as a credible endurance choice with cost. A touch more friction from survival instincts (e.g., a tempted but rejected rescue tactic) could deepen contradiction further.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—mirroring the sky inside walls—is clear and drives each choice under time pressure. Interiority is particular (texture of carvings, scent of damp paper) and embodied. Internal contradiction is light; she reads more focused than torn, with minimal ambivalence beyond urgency. The final renunciation (no brush, use the hand) feels earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to chart a discovery) is clear and her micro‑choices (kneeling to decode, choosing not to call the captain) align with it. Interiority is concrete and embodied—heart hammering, tactile engagement with wood and glow. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; she never wavers about sharing or the risk of being wrong. The cost is present but quiet (chosen solitude), which limits depth of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motivation—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is specific and coherently pursued through trial, frustration, and the final gentler tactic. Interiority is present (frustration, re-reading the prophecy) though contradictory impulses are mild; he stays competent and calm rather than ethically or emotionally split. His micro-choices (gear selection, interpreting “uncap”) reveal values of precision over force. The change at the end reads earned, though the felt personal cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aelia’s motive—to heal the land by rallying the settlers—is clear and consistent, and her nightly draining effort embodies real cost. Interiority is present but largely summarized; we get little contradictory impulse beyond care versus depletion. Her decisive shift (revealing herself at the arch) is motivated and earned, though internal conflict at the moment of risk could be sharper. Secondary characters are collective and off‑page, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clean and intensifies from duty (calibration) to a risked renunciation (allow rest). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile handling of the puppet head and attunement to the Clockwork Heart. The choice carries cost—she forecloses “prolonging” in favor of release—and reads earned by the nested-pattern work and the plea encoded in the object. A bit more contradiction under pressure (fear vs. mercy) could deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s duty-driven motive is clear and embodied (fear vs obligation under the birds), with credible micro-choices under pressure. The “reluctant caretaker” thread reads consistently through action and perception. Internal contradiction is present but light; we don’t feel a deep cost or fracture in him at the end. The traveler is reactive but functions well as pressure rather than character.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is concrete and character‑specific (atonement after a toxic byproduct failure), with embodied perception filtered through a chemist’s eye. The chrysalis and foam catalyze micro‑choices that reveal him. The turn to “call Lena” feels earned but a touch tidy; contradictory impulses (guilt vs. drive) could surface more under pressure. Emotional cost is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivations are clear—Elara’s custodial quest and the old man’s parole—yet pressure rarely exposes contradictory impulses or costs within Elara. Her competence never meets resistance, so interiority remains composed rather than tested. The man’s embodied anguish reads, but he functions more as a client than a counterforce. The final stance shift (custodian) is earned but lightly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive (to neutralize corrosive memories) is clear and consistent, and his endurance under psychic pain reveals values through action. Interiority is particular to a “chef who tastes memories,” with embodied detail (“metallic scent,” “ash and brine”) grounding emotion. The final cost—taking the remorse into himself—reads as an earned renunciation rather than an easy fix. Some contradiction (dread vs. duty) is present but could sharpen earlier to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive (repair the city’s broken conversation) is clear and her choices align with “empathetically decisive.” However, internal conflict is minimal and the scene offers little resistance to test her values, so we see competence more than contradiction. Speaking to the brass weight reveals specificity and worldview. The earned shift is credible but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and methods are clear, embodied, and pressured: she calibrates, chooses to enter, recoils, then recommits with a redefined aim. The contradiction between craving mastery and risking madness surfaces convincingly in the “flood” and her shaken withdrawal. Her final stance—restorer not archaeologist—feels earned by what she endures. A slight label-y note (“helix-minded”) is decorative but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her final decision to become a sentinel feels earned by the build‑up from archivist to bearer. Internal contradiction is light—she’s competent and rarely strained—so the emotional cost reads more declared than felt. Embodied detail (ears popping, stomach lurch) helps, but her “prism‑mind” is more label than dramatized flaw. The closing renunciation of hiding is credible, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied through tactile craft; her micro-choices (exhuming the failed piece, easing tension, waiting, then choosing to strum) align with her values. The despair before the breeze and the choice to invite rather than force music reveal character without sermonizing. Internal contradiction is subtle but present (faith vs. encroaching hopelessness). The cost is emotional and temporal, credibly earned for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s ethos (refusing a ruthless gambit) cleanly motivates his present tactic of “translating silence.” His actions—measured listening, the counter‑frequency hum, decoding the tapping—align with “thoughtfully precise” interiority. Contradictory impulses are muted; he’s steady rather than torn, which narrows complexity slightly. The sister adds gentle pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear motive (cataloging silence) drives precise, embodied action (tuning the clasp) and yields a credible internal reorientation. The pacifist-against-noise stance evolves under pressure from the fireworks. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific rather than labeled. The change costs her a purist identity without feeling pat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive and flaw (ambition curdling into impatience) are cleanly dramatized, and micro-choices—lining the pot with the burlap, reaching to move the plant, then refusing to move it—reveal values under pressure. Her interiority is specific to her sensory bias and craft, not generic. The final renunciation (sitting with the smell) is earned and carries a felt cost. Minor neatness in the epiphany edges toward tidiness but remains credible.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive (obsessive need to find the Grovetree’s resilience) is clear and drives every action. Interiority is present but leans descriptive over contradiction; we don’t see much friction between fear and compulsion in-the-moment. Her micro-choices—following water under inversion, handling the arrow tip, entering the cave—align with character and escalate commitment. The final identity shift to “keeper of the silence” feels earned, if emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vale’s motive—cultivating foresight in action—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (dust test, chasing the pull, broadcasting a countermeasure). Competence under pressure reads credible, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or reveals a competing impulse. The patch triggers a personal-professional recognition that deepens her drive, though the emotional cost is sketched more than embodied. Final stance (standing her ground, transmitting) feels earned but not scalded by visible personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and specific—“to certify wonder as essential”—and actions align (placing the amber, humming rather than ringing). Interiority is vivid through synesthetic perception, but contradictory impulses are light; he rarely hesitates or missteps. The cost registers as exhaustion and the relinquishing of the amber’s purpose, but the internal struggle is largely smooth. Strong embodiment with a slightly idealized, low-friction arc keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—shifting from protection to understanding—and her fear versus curiosity conflict reads credibly in action. Her micro-choices (laying markers, uncasing the flute, choosing to study rather than repair) reveal values under pressure. The emotional cost (“painful clarity,” renunciation of repair) lands, though the scene seldom pushes her into contradiction beyond a single, controlled trial. Strong interiority, if a touch stately, keeps her particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsession, coping mechanism (personality-borrowing), and decision to “go deeper” generate credible, contradictory impulses under pressure. The archivist possession and the wrenching removal of the fragment embody cost and degradation. One slight convenience—“She understood its purpose instantly”—skips a beat of earned inference but doesn’t undermine the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s jitteriness, loyalty to Kael, and buried hunger for wonder are concrete and drive his choices, especially when he decides to raise the pendant. The shift from fear to clarity is motivated by the pendant’s resonance but reads a touch convenient, compressing internal contradiction quickly. Embodied details (fluttering hands, ridgeway exposure) help. The final identity turn feels earned if slightly tidy, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—she “reads the texture of the air” and kneels to feel energy, then hits despair when the prism “answers with only geometry.” Her pivot to the frost arises from her attentional discipline, not luck. The renunciation of her initial thesis lands with a credible cost (the “wave of despair” and losing a cherished belief). Internal contradiction is present but gentle; the struggle could press harder against her blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (to carry a message and hold the orchard together) is clear and sustained, and her despair-versus-duty tension is credible. Her agency spikes in the puzzle/amber sequence and culminates in renouncing the loom, a cost that fits her identity. Interiority is specific (dye-stained fingers, memory-led choices) rather than generic. Slight limitation: the inner contradiction is suggested more than dramatized in-scene, keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to rebuild stronger and transmute fragility into resilience—is clear and consistently enacted. The meek/determined contradiction is credible, with the barter choice revealing values under pressure. Emotional embodiment is present (tactile anchoring with silk, the siphoning of fear), though the post‑barter confidence risks feeling slightly tidy. The cost—losing fear/meekness memories—lands as a meaningful alteration rather than a simple upgrade.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive (find the withheld truth/Aris) is crisp and persistently enacted, and her professional lens (“sensory map maker,” redirect mastery) colors perception and choice. Interiority is specific and embodied (rusted gantries, cyclic resonance) rather than generic. However, contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely wavers under pressure, which softens the crucible. The final commitment reads earned but not hard-won by competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s practical reticence undercuts and then catalyzes his protective impulse; the contradiction reads lived-in, not imposed. Embodied cues (sea glass in his palm, the jar clatter, the cold) root emotion. Micro‑choices are clear—pocketing the letters, refusing the presence, building the cairn. The internal turn from skepticism to charged defiance feels earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s interiority is specific—his rasping laughter, ritual competence, and “shadowed elation” under pressure feel lived-in and contradictory. Motivation (guiding ships and shaping a new dawn) cleanly drives his micro‑choice to over‑amplify. The fearful awe at the end registers as a credible cost, though the price remains more conceptual than embodied. A touch more on-the-page hesitation or physical consequence in the peak beat could deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hira’s motive (to understand the donor heart’s narrative magnetism) is clear and drives concrete choices (three days tracking light, surrendering the wing, submitting to the projection). The internal contradiction—“watchful” craftsperson vs. “quietly explosive” post‑surgery impulse—feels lived and dramatized rather than declared. Interiority is specific to a dyer’s sensibility without therapy‑speak. The closing acceptance forecloses a prior path (self as singular author) with a felt identity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motives are specific and consistent: a technician’s duty fused with a private quest to learn what the yews witnessed. Interiority is embodied (oilskin rustle, tool weight) and her choices—climbing, positioning, waiting, reading—reveal character under pressure. The final acceptance (“some things are not meant to be fixed, only held”) feels earned by the on‑page repricing. Slight tidiness in the emotional pivot keeps it from the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and constant, and her attribute—binding a community—manifests in the pivotal gathering and song. Interiority is textured (trembling, fractured recollections) but contradictory impulses are light; once the note emerges, she scarcely hesitates. Actions align cleanly with goals, though the felt personal cost at the end remains more implied than dramatized. Overall, purposeful and coherent characterization with minor depth limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motives are clear and coherent: avoidance born of shame gives way to a deliberate confrontation with her failure. Interiority is specific (the book as “heavier than she remembered,” the bodily pacing) and choices track to pressure. The internal contradiction—yearning for solitude vs. need to reengage—is dramatized in concrete actions (hiding the invitation, then going). The final renunciation (rejoining without surrendering self-definition) feels earned with a subtle, credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—resisting the world’s “graying” by seeking the sacred—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (bringing the fossilized bread, accepting the shared loaf, planting saffron). Interiority is specific and embodied (“pockets…full of seeds”; relief at finding kinship). Internal contradiction is mild (loneliness vs belief) rather than strongly dramatized, keeping the arc gentle. The closing commitment to tend the garden reads as an earned endurance with a visible cost (ongoing vigilance).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to salvage meaning from entropy) is clear and consistent, and her meticulous choices (discovering, calibrating, sampling) align with that drive. The internal shift from archivist of decay to awakener of a living system feels earned. However, on‑page contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely wavers or pays a personal emotional price beyond reverent patience. The cost is mostly conceptual (spent slide; abandoned premise), not deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (revenge/proof via the “sound of trust breaking”) are clean, embodied, and tested in scene; her contradictory impulses surface in the hand‑clasp moment where residual affection collides with accusation. Micro‑choices—paying with the last relic of her mother, pressing Silas with specifics, clicking the recorder late—reveal hierarchy of values. Silas reads as a person, not a prop, through weary sadness and a tender, damning gesture. The final renunciation carries a visible cost and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s skeptical empiricist stance is concrete and embodied through his taste‑sense and the ring, then credibly reconfigured at the end. The internal conflict between data‑demand and awe operates in scene (“a demand for empirical data over awe”) and culminates in the choice to descend, ask “Why?”, and stay to join. Emotional texture is specific (ozone, damp moss, petrichor) rather than labeled. The cost—renouncing a singular, rational North for a pluralistic purpose—is felt and earned at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alistair’s motive—trapped in replication yet aching to create—is clear and embodied (charcoal‑stained fingers, the nightly “gravity”). His defiant hurling of the box is a concrete micro‑choice revealing contradiction and frustration. The late realization (“memory was merely the tool”) lands credibly given prior setup, though a touch of declarative epiphany trims the mystery. Cost is acknowledged in the “sorrow for his wasted years,” giving the change weight.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation (to find where lost conversations go) is clear and coherently compels her descent. The embodied cost of dishonesty (wilting, leaden limbs) grounds interiority in specific, character‑particular terms. A credible shift occurs when she drinks from the spring and resolves to disseminate the truth. The inner contradiction (retreat from lies vs. compulsion to seek truth) is present but could tighten under the final decision for a sharper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clean and character‑particular, and her competence reads plausibly through tactile, technical choices. Interiority is embodied via how she “listens” through boots and hands rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the piece largely avoids friction between competing impulses. The solution comes with little visible struggle beyond craft, keeping the arc sturdy but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, urgent motive (resolve inner static before the storm) drives concrete, high-pressure choices. Interiority feels specific to a caretaker android—sensory bias toward roses and system flux—without therapy-speak. Contradiction lands (recoils from terror vs. programming to contain), and the final acceptance reads earned. The cost is mostly risked rather than suffered, softening the edge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to prove listening heals—drives coherent choices from the grate to the hospital. Interiority is steady and embodied (the locket’s “weight,” her silent invitation), but contradictory impulses are minimal, so cost to her remains light. Leo’s on‑page presence creates a brief, potent relational crucible, yet Elara never faces a hard trade‑off. The change is a credible endurance/stance crystallization rather than a risky transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s driving motive—transmuting solitude into strength—is clear and enacted through embodied choices (the dance as cipher). The moment she encrypts her fear and then reverses it for the final unlock shows credible internal contradiction turned tactic. However, struggle feels relatively frictive-free; her competence rarely meets failure or cost beyond conceptual renunciation. The AI’s presence softens her isolation swiftly, slightly easing the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive—to recover a surgically absent love-memory—is clear, persistent, and informs every choice from secrecy to the mine descent. Embodied beats (gravity pockets pinning her; flinches as she picks) keep emotion physical rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is mild (need eclipsing fear vs. duty) but present enough to avoid tidiness. The renunciation at the end (taking only her flower) lands as earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and constant: a solitary summoner intent on hushing a dangerous prophecy. Interiority is particular (using breath and the brook’s flow) but largely free of contradiction; she rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses. Micro‑choices (inviting patterns, mapping silence, targeting the core syllable) align with her ethos of gentleness over force. The cost is primarily exertion and focus rather than a conflicted sacrifice, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive—to learn the building’s language—reads specific and embodied, and her choice to break the “agreed upon lies” at the meteor peak feels motivated. The tutor’s presence is distinct and pressuring without stealing POV, and the seal beat reveals Elara under pressure. Some emotions are elegantly implied rather than dramatized at peak stress, but ambiguity serves the piece. The loss of the mentor and acceptance of duty constitute a credible, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s skepticism versus the garden’s numinous pull creates a credible internal crucible, and her choice to place the shell on the Archive is motivated and specific. Interiority is embodied (“vibrated in her teeth,” “a shudder of recognition”) rather than labeled. The final stance shift—accepting grief as sea not prison—feels earned by the sensory re‑immersion in the memory. The arc is slightly tidy, but the cost (fully re‑feeling the brother’s death) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelin’s motive is urgent and specific, and her micro-choices (choosing truth over evasion; patient, bone-deep craft; not reaching for a weapon) track cleanly under pressure. The embodied details (ink-thickened thorn, cool air, heartbeat) support her interiority without diagnosis-speak. Varos arrives with a credible, grief-laden counterforce that reframes rather than flattens her agency. Internal contradiction is present but modest; she adapts more than she wrestles.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and duty are clear and consistent, and her final choice to accept the burden of remembrance reads motivated. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely struggles on the page beyond longing, which trims complexity. The embodied cost is implied rather than dramatized. Still, her perception shaping action (tuning the nexus) reveals character effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive—to salvage one untainted truth—feels specific and consistent, and her methodical selection of the “window” shows agency. Interiority is embodied through the cold, candlelit setting rather than abstract labels. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; she doesn’t face a sharpened dilemma on the page beyond care versus haste. The final renunciatory cost is conceptual rather than emotionally strained in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ren’s motive—quietly honoring hidden labor by freeing disoriented fireflies—is clear and embodied in specific micro‑choices (the whistle, the delicate rescue, the refusal of applause). Interiority is mostly externalized through action and modest, apt reflection; little internal contradiction appears beyond “demure audacity,” so the arc leans endurance over change. The relationship with Lin provides a small crucible: her question elicits a principled stance rather than sentiment. The final renunciation (doing it without notice) reads earned, though the cost remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to dismantle myths is vivid and consistent, and her renunciation at the end reads as a credible price paid against her core identity. The contradiction between debunker and protector is dramatized through micro‑choices (staying in the storm, continuing the letter work). The epiphany skirts neatness but is motivated by the letters and the storm’s sensory rupture. Embodied detail (grit on goggles, the howling dust) grounds her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and active: a visionary seeking truth versus the lure of belonging. Interiority shows credible tension—his “brutal pull of variant allegiance” and loneliness sharpen the choice. Embodied detail (pliers, tubes, storm percussion) grounds emotion, though more on-page contradiction at the peak could deepen cost. The renunciation of the Aerie feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orin’s motivations are clear and consistent—salvaging elders’ voices and redeeming a lost song—and his odd method reveals character under pressure. Interiority is specific (“quiet, positively wistful hope”), with embodied, tactile actions (working the seam for days). Internal contradiction is gentle (skepticism of pen vs. faith in jars) rather than sharply dramatized, so the crucible remains low‑heat. The earned shift from collector to conduit lands, though his flaws are cushioned by the piece’s tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear motive (protect artifact/place) and a credible trait set (engineer who “feels” the lighthouse) drive on‑page choices. His panic → recalibration beat shows internal contradiction resolving into attentive listening. Interiority stays embodied (hand to stone, bone‑felt wrongness) rather than abstract. Slight neatness at the end—the win lands without a palpable lingering personal cost—keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s impatience vs. trained vigilance produces a credible internal contradiction, and her embodied beats (chart‑checking, standing her ground) align with motive. The arc from mapper to keeper is earned by the scene’s pressures. The cost—renouncing impatience—is felt but soft. A secondary stressor (beyond environment) could have deepened micro‑choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “professional shell” colliding with possession creates credible, simultaneous impulses. The micro‑choice to lift and then keep the lantern, and later to draft an “unorthodox” report, aligns with her methods yet reveals change. Embodied stress (smell of wet concrete, reverberations) grounds emotion. Slightly declarative moral framing at the end trims ambiguity but doesn’t break motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivations are clean and character‑particular: Vale seeks to enact atonement; Liam’s caution and craft drive the operative beats. Interiority is spare but embodied (tears, tactile handling), though the chaplain’s inner conflict remains more stated than dramatized. The relationship dynamic is effective—professional reserve meets moral urgency—but pressure on Vale doesn’t force a choice at the climax. The change lands more in understanding than in action, which is credible but limits depth of character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Fix’s motive is clear and particular, and the occupational texture feels lived-in, but internal conflict is minimal and the peak choice carries little on‑page cost. The “whim” with the kaleidoscope reads more as cleverness than a pressured, value‑revealing trade‑off. Emotional beats (“irreverent awe,” laughter) are apt yet conventional. Strong competency, low contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (finding where deleted files go) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (cross‑referencing, breaching encryption) align. Interiority is effective but mostly summarized rather than embodied; conflict between duty and risk remains implied. The “brightly attentive” trait feels lived, not merely labeled, but emotional texture could complicate her drive more. The final acceptance of a terrifying truth reads as an earned, quiet renunciation with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and internal pivot—from guarding borders to intervening—are clear and earned by Kael’s plea. Her “calm intuition” leads to concrete choices (mirrors, mobilization). However, some emotional language skews abstract (“map empathy onto action”), softening embodied conflict. Kael functions primarily as catalyst, offering little pressure beyond the initial plea.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive shift—from euthanasia tourist to seeker of “approaching endings”—is clear and embodied through volunteering and the parasol talisman. Interiority is sensorially grounded (cold, wind, boat creaks) rather than label-only. The old/new self tension is present but mostly conceptual; simultaneous in‑scene contradiction under pressure is muted, keeping the arc serene rather than contested. The renunciation at the end reads earned, though the on‑page cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her tactile relationship with vines and the “always” shard reveals a grounded psyche rather than a generic mourner. Motivation (to rediscover and re‑center her “always”) is clear and actions align, culminating in the choice to crumble the letter. The shift feels earned via the parallel with the vines’ hardship‑sweetness, not a sudden epiphany. Slight limitation: her contradictory impulses are present but subdued, keeping tension quieter than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motive (“preserve the echo”) drives concrete tactics; agency is steady and competent. Interiority is filtered through craft (peripheral vision, tactile link to the parapet) rather than label-speak. Status dynamics with the prophet are legible through dialogue and stance. Minor ding: little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost beyond urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (transmuting pain through quiet patterning) is clear and consistent, and her choices—to seek the field and convene descendants—align with it. Interiority is textured but largely steady; contradictory impulses or visible costs under pressure are minimal. Her “perceptively calm” trait informs method more than conflict. The closing act feels earned, though the personal price is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—decoding growth in the “silent spaces”—is specific and drives her micro‑choices from handling the shard to the decision to testify. Interiority is embodied (heart hammering, the hush, the shock at the shard’s effect) and consistent with a reticent scholar pushed into speech. The turn to testify is earned by the chandelier’s revealed function and her long obsession. The cost is mostly vulnerability rather than loss, but it’s felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s drive—to capture the sound of aging—feels particular and embodied in her tactile tactics (driftwood arrows, chalk on fog). The pull between trusting the marker and following the bodily echo shows real internal conflict under pressure. The final Earned Stasis—standing to listen after memory erases the mission—lands as a costly, character‑true renunciation. Minor note: emotional nuance is strong, though a second frictive pressure (beyond the single left/right dilemma) could deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices under pressure (arming the mechanism instead of scrambling for safety). Her competence and tremor‑ridden restraint give her interiority specificity. The conflict between custodian duty and secret artistic drive surfaces credibly in the quake. A deeper contradiction (art vs. survival voiced or acted upon) could heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—execute a flawless, gentle goodbye—is clear, consistent, and enacted through specific micro‑choices (withholding results, shifting songs, using the vinyl shard). Interiority is economical but present, filtered through her practiced calm and tactile habits. The piece favors competence over contradiction, so internal conflict is muted, but the ethical edge of not telling the results adds needed tension. Mr. Gable registers as a felt presence with distinct need (“the song… it’s skipping”).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and consistently embodied—careful movement, patience, and scholarly rigor under pressure. The “quietly deliberate” trait shapes tactics and cost (weeks of labor) but internal contradiction is light. Her commitment to relearning alongside the automaton reveals character through action. Emotional texture is steady rather than volatile, limiting depth of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—skepticism and sudden openness—are dramatized through concrete choices (slipping away, using the tooth, entering the portal). Her historian’s eye and bonesetter lineage plausibly drive tactics and tenderness under pressure. The “alchemy/constellations” phrasing edges toward stated theme, but the core motivation and embodied action stay grounded. The final charged poise (holding Leo and the tooth before the Fae) reads as an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—“to share light without using fire”—is clear, consistent, and actionably resolved by the end. Her tactile, craft-based interiority is specific and embodied (she “weighs its significance, not its mass,” then polishes by feel). Internal conflict is quiet (uncertainty about how to share) rather than oppositional, but it credibly tightens into a decision. The renunciation of torches for a slower, less-recognized offering lands as a modest but earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—reclaiming her exposed interiority—is specific, embodied, and threaded through concrete choices (returning to the center, clutching the pendant, finally offering it). Her shame and her urge to re-mean the wound coexist credibly in scene. The relationship dynamic with Kael adds pressure without over-explaining. The turn risks neatness but earns it via staged actions and costed vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s need—“to collect the shapes of different hopes” to cure his paralysis—reads specific and embodied, and the shell talisman grounds his interiority. The old woman arrives with a distinct ethic (“solemnize his choice”), sharpening his conflict without sermonizing. The final decision to write about her instead of the fishermen feels earned by the encounter. Slight tidiness in the epiphany (“meant to be lived”) softens the messiness of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—restoring sacred practices inherited from her grandmother—is clear, embodied, and consistent. The tinkerer-vs-singer tension gives her a credible internal contradiction that pays off when she risks voice over tools. Interiority is specific (oil-smudged fingers, failing hope) without therapy-speak. The felt cost is modest, more a renunciation of fix-it impulse than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—translating grief into a lasting “map”—is clear and persists through deliberate, tactically specific choices. The embodied patience (breath, posture, waiting for the alembic’s recognition) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The internal contradiction between her “flash-paper” past and her current slowness is present but not stressed into on‑page conflict. Still, her final renunciation of spectacle for permanence reads earned via the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is vivid and character‑particular, and her tactics align with her craft. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are muted; she meets little psychological resistance beyond quiet obsession. Micro‑choices (the mirror, mapping echoes) reveal a mind at work but not under real duress. The endurance change at the end reads earned but low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to collect burdens) is clear and drives each micro‑choice, with credible internal contradiction between empathy and panic. Embodied responses (cold jolt, trapped hands) ground her interiority. Her final renunciatory choice—acceptance over struggle—feels earned and costly. Minor abstraction in phrasing doesn’t blunt the character’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to “contain” grief and harvest a lesson) is clear and embodied in specific, character‑particular choices (timeboxing with the kettle; refusing to carve a lion). The internal contradiction—pain versus “hauntingly practical” craft—plays out credibly in micro‑choices (tool selection, negative space, vessel not monument). The cost is legible: she foregoes literal memorial and stops when time is up, accepting “for now.” Interiority is precise and avoids therapy‑speak, letting tactile details reveal her.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—to confront her former self—drives each micro‑choice, especially the hesitation before the final click. Interiority is specific and embodied (“knees cracking,” breath as the only sound) with credible contradiction (avoidance vs. completion). The renunciation/acceptance at the end feels earned by the preceding regret. Limited external interaction is appropriate for the piece’s inward crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive and perceptual lens are clear and character‑particular (“functionally creative,” “equations for hope”). Actions align with motive across beats (sextant alignment → hatch → reroute power). Internal contradiction is light; her competence meets little real resistance, so change happens without visible personal cost. The result is credible but low‑friction, limiting depth of character conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s introversion, ritual competence, and buried musical longing are dramatized through embodied choices (kneeling to trace water, freezing at the door, offering the score). Fear-to-recognition is credible, and her final renunciation (releasing the notes) feels earned. Minor neatness in the epiphany trims edge complexity, but contradictory impulses (terror vs. petrichor‑soothed understanding; duty vs. dream) operate on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is crisp—an errant seeker chasing a myth—manifested through concrete choices (probing, aligning the sundial, committing to the warehouse). Interiority feels earned and embodied (“quiet and total” shock; the canal’s textures filtering perception). Slight limitation: internal contradiction is light; he rarely resists or doubts, so the cost reads primarily conceptual rather than contested in-scene. Still, the final repricing of his life’s pursuit lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving ancient methods by decoding knots—is clear and consistent, and her patient, tactile attention reads as character-specific action. Embodied details (kneeling in the snow, fulgurite to the eye) convey emotion without label-speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; there’s little simultaneous push-pull beyond endurance. The final resolve feels earned but low-cost, with no sharp micro-choice exposing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear motives (Elias’s craft; the Countess’s grief) and embodied emotions land through small, specific choices (the whiskey tap, the leaf, the smile). Interiority is implied rather than told, fitting the restraint. Contradictory impulses are subtle—her guarded distance softens under his conjured presence—but credible. Change at the end (her lightened “explained absence”) feels earned by their exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and particular—reawaken beauty in a sterile world—and his choices (assembling the key, refusing to hatch, integrating the egg, powering the core) align under pressure. Interiority is embodied (oil‑smudged finery, tears cutting grime) and avoids abstraction. The success/failure doubleness at the end reads as an earned endurance/renunciation with cost. A sharper on‑page contradiction mid‑build (e.g., a live temptation to betray his principle) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—“to prove that scars can sing”—and her paradox (arsonist’s daughter/firefighter) informs every choice. On‑page micro‑choices (selecting obsidian, threading red, blowing across the piece) reveal values under gentle pressure. The cost is mostly internal and quiet, with limited contradictory impulses expressed in the present moment. A touch more friction in‑scene would elevate the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to liberate the city’s memories) is clear and drives concrete choices: following the hum, reading the breadcrumbs, and committing to a long vigil. The skeptic/imaginative contradiction is dramatized rather than labeled—she tests the glass, then shifts to observation. Emotional cost registers as defiant, patient endurance rather than melodrama. A slightly greater pressure on her limits or a sharper internal snag would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s ethic “to share light without using fire” coherently drives every choice, and the internal breach—defying her lineage’s non‑interference—reads as a credible, costly turn. Interiority is specific to her perceptual idiom (light, resonance, petals) rather than stock labels. The contradictory impulses (stewardship vs. intervention) are dramatized in the gear/probe beats. The only limit is the cost remains mostly conceptual; we don’t glimpse relational fallout beyond her felt cage.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eliran’s interiority is specific—his meditative craft, the spectral prompting, and the tactile engagement with ribbons show a coherent, motivated mind. The motive evolves credibly from commission to a broader quest to understand “collective grief.” Internal contradiction is mild (serenity vs. disturbance by the inner voice) and could push harder under pressure. Still, his final choice to alter his carving practice is earned and revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—ethically diligent devotion to restoring balance—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (waiting for the pendulum pause, painstaking adjustments) align. Interiority is textured by sensory focus (oil, brass, rhythm) rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses are minimal; he rarely wavers or pays a palpable personal cost beyond fatigue. The arc is endurance rather than transformation, credible but not deeply conflictual.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to discover the shape of intentions”—is clear and governs each choice from walking to the silo to decoding the tapestry. Interiority is specific and embodied (the tactile decoding, the sovereign case warming) though internal contradiction is mild; pressure never forces a painful trade. Her final stance shift (“blithe no longer”) reads earned by the discoveries on the page. The character is distinct without lapsing into stock cues.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation is lucid and consistent—innovation under an unforgiving constraint—and his internal paradox (“groundedly imaginative”) informs tactics. However, emotion is largely conceptualized rather than embodied; the felt risk reads mostly in statements (“to risk everything”) and a single breath release. Micro‑choices are present (rejecting the “safe prediction” to chase the anomaly), but the cost of that pivot isn’t viscerally dramatized. The ending reflects earned resolve, but ambiguity or fear under pressure remains underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s longing-driven shift from meticulous copyist to illicit broadcaster reads motivated and consistent, with tactile embodiment (the green dial glow, her “thistled calm”). Internal contradiction is subtle (fear vs compulsion) rather than dramatized; we seldom see her waver under pressure. Still, her micro-choices—deciphering the lyrics, entering the conservatory, training the dust—reveal character. The closing renunciation of safety is credible though the felt cost is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is sharply defined (to crystallize a fleeting emotion), with embodied, specific actions under pressure. The internal contradiction—preserving the mother vs. admitting the portrait is a “beautiful fiction”—is dramatized, not merely told. A slightly declarative line (“She was not preserving her mother; she was preserving her own need.”) trims mystery but remains earned. The final renunciation (blurring the face) carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to preserve inquiry against dogma—is clear and drives concrete choices (diving, tracing the cog, reinterpreting history). The inner conflict between sanctioned history and physical evidence is dramatized at the chronometer, not just asserted. Emotional texture leans abstract at times (“abrasive calm,” “furious peace”), softening embodiment. Still, his final resolve to “restart the clock of history” reads as an earned shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eliza’s motivation and methods are specific and embodied—she chooses subtraction and targeted coaching under pressure, revealing values and trade‑offs. Her “expectant resignation” credibly steers her away from confrontation toward a charged, craft‑based victory. Leo reads thinner but functions as a live pressure point whose softening is earned beat by beat. The ending’s renunciation (accepting the program’s loss) lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—turn ruin into beauty and heal a numbed city—embodied in tactile labor and precise culinary choices. Her hollowness versus her capacity to awaken others provides an understated contradiction that pays off when she finally tastes the fruit. Interiority is specific (snipping, tending, gelée technique) rather than abstract, though true internal conflict remains gentle rather than pressurized. The final shift from vicarious to self-claimed future reads earned, if emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Arawn’s solitude, involuntary truthfulness, and fear of the box create a credible inner life that informs his choice between power and bees. The riddle prompts small, purposeful micro-choices that reveal competence under pressure. The final act aligns with his values (wonder over function) and bears a visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild; he resolves quickly without deep destabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—understanding why some houses feel alive—drives observation to decisive action, and the shift from noticer to participant feels earned. Interiority is specific (the orris root’s “shard of hush”) and embodied. Internal conflict is subtle rather than contested on the page, but the renunciation of pure observation carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veridian’s shift from absolute guardian to agent of nuance is motivated by the telepathic revelation and the presence’s guidance, with concrete micro‑choices (threading thought, shifting coral, smashing the ampoule). The internal contradiction—warden versus liberator—operates in scene rather than summary. Emotions are embodied through tactile, setting‑rooted perception rather than labels. The self‑sacrifice at the end reads as earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “grim optimist” ethos is dramatized through calculated risk and triple‑checked equations, not labels. Her micro‑choices (skidding on the thousandth step; using the chipped die’s bias) align with a coherent hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—recklessness and meticulousness—coexist on the page. The inner cost registers, though moral or relational counterpressure is minimal at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied: insomnia, ritual ascent, and the tactile comfort of the abalone tip establish motive and flaw. The contradictory impulses—skeptical of her grandfather’s “lost languages” yet methodically hopeful—converge in the decision to let the brush lead. Micro‑choices (dipping into water, writing characters she can’t read) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The change at the end (accepting connection as the measure of success) feels earned, with the cost of exhaustion and vulnerability on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the lens as a proxy for a dying culture—is clear and drives discrete choices (bread ritual → turbine thaw → vow). Interiority is particular (“rosewater dread,” the beekeeper’s song) and embodied through dangerous, wet, icy labor. A credible contradiction—terror under the waterfall versus curatorial resolve—animates her arc. Slightly declarative closing anaphora trims complexity but doesn’t undercut earned resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliran’s drive—to step beyond fate—is specific and embodied in tactile craft; his oil‑stained urgency and “bleak exhilaration” feel character‑particular. Interiority is concrete (mapping yoyo tension, counter‑gears), and actions align with motive. The cost emerges conceptually at the end, but we get little on-page contradiction or hesitation before activation, limiting depth of internal conflict. Still, his competence under pressure reads credible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motive (break the curse) is clear and tightens under pressure; his embodied fear (“taste of ozone and rotting cotton candy,” raw throat, trembling urgency) reads specific. Contradictory impulses—terror vs. the will to write paradoxes—surface credibly in his micro‑choices. The advisor applies immediate pressure without stealing agency. The closing endurance (“not saved, but unburdened”) feels earned with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) drives coherent choices under pressure, and embodied cost lands (aching arm, ragged breath). However, there’s little contradictory impulse or doubt on the page, so internal conflict stays shallow. The competence-forward stance reads assured rather than contested, limiting felt risk. Final renaming of the mallet hints at reconfiguration but not a deep moral trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear, specific, and rooted in vocation; her quiet obsession and dread drive concrete choices (the descent and the whistle-blow). Interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, though internal contradiction is modest (purpose braided with fear rather than a sharp clash). The lack of an on‑page counterforce in dialogue limits relational pressure. Still, her final act feels earned by prior pattern-reading and legacy tool belief.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s “emotionally rational” stance is dramatized through disciplined method and a credible internal tremor when Elara reframes the evidence. His choice to go to the station and then to form a pact reads earned, showing a before/after in how he pursues truth. Embodied details (heart thudding; the letter raised) anchor emotion without over-explaining. Elara is sketched efficiently and applies real pressure, though her own interiority remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ansel’s motive—to archive what erosion erases—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (night trespass, prying the stone, sealing notes). His “stoically sensitive” texture shows in embodied responses (freezing at the scrape, the quiet ritual with the inkwell). The crack when Elara appears feels earned and reveals value hierarchy (privacy → shared custodianship). Internal conflict is present but gentle; higher-stakes contradiction could deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive—tracing honest origins—drives every choice, and his tranquil competence under blackout conditions feels earned and particular. The frustration → reframing micro‑turn gives him a credible interior shift without melodrama. Emotional texture is embodied (soundscape, touch of the stamp), if a touch cool. Deeper contradiction or a visible personal cost beyond intellectual stakes would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline and embodied—he seeks to transmute grief into a lantern for the lost shadow, paying with a piece of his soul. Interiority is textured via craft and sensation (“shattering sorrow gilded by the beauty of his task”). Internal contradiction is present but gentle (torment vs. beauty; descending while ascending), with little resistance beyond cost. The final acceptance feels earned through process rather than epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelen’s hollow ache from surviving a drone‑struck wedding drives every move, and the terror/euphoria mix during the awakening shows contradictory impulses in scene. His hunt for “unused potential” manifests in concrete micro‑choices (dropping the geode, moving through corridors, choosing to permeate the mirror). The final renunciation/embrace—becoming a “variable” with cost that does not erase his trauma—feels earned. A relational crucible is absent, but not needed at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent, and her embodied reactions (the weight of the bar, the hum in her teeth) ground her. However, the internal conflict is modest—competence glides her to insight with little friction or contradiction. The vow at the end reads earned but light on cost. The “perpetually surprised” trait adds color more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are specific and conflicted—payment versus the need to weigh truth—embodied in tactile beats (numb fingers on carvings, the watch hand’s “heft”). Her guilt isn’t generic; it’s tied to past choices that now corner her. The on‑page renunciation (refusing to deliver the lie) is earned and costly. Minor ding: a few lines verge on declared feeling rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt‑driven motivation is clear and embodied, and her micro‑choices (signaling the guards, accepting the token, deciding to leave it) track cleanly to her role and flaw. The relationship with Kael functions as a crucible without melodrama, their shared shame credible. The resolution tilts a bit tidy, but the cost—renouncing an identity tethered to a single failure—reads earned. Kael’s interiority is minimal yet his one admission efficiently pressures Elara’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—boots scraping, the cold heft of the compass—while his “merrily melancholic” posture shows credible contradiction in action. His micro-choices (rejecting the stars, adopting the poles, stopping at the outcrop, reframing the compass) align with a clear motivation to “align heart and action.” The shift from grand navigator to modest traveler is earned and carries the cost of renouncing a former identity. A few lines verge on thematic summary, but the change is dramatized rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive—manufactured emptiness against a paid-for motive—reads clearly and propels concrete choices. Interiority is specific (the “museum exhibit behind glass” feeling) and actions (finding and aiding the geologist) align with the goal to kindle empathy. The internal contradiction (clean slate vs. dirty past) is active in scene and reframed by the baseball and lake. The cost is modest but credible: renouncing avoidance for integration.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alaric’s drive to undo a past failure is clear and embodied in concrete choices (gathering spices for a decade; stepping into pain). The internal contradiction—his urge to dwell in grief versus the courage to re-enter the wound—is dramatized, not just stated. A slightly on‑the‑nose line (“This was his reluctant metamorphosis”) trims subtlety but doesn’t undercut earned change. His steadiness under pressure differentiates action from interior state convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (a mother’s hunger to find where lost time goes) is vivid and particular, and her embodied experience (thin air, trembling hands, ink work) grounds her. The internal tension—arcane pursuit versus intimate, maternal pull—materializes in the turn from cosmic regret to familial ritual. The final renunciation (go home, trace the child’s hand) feels earned, though the struggle resolves a touch neatly. A slightly sharper on‑page cost or moment of resistance would deepen the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Steward’s motive—to safeguard and then unlock a path for humanity’s legacy—drives every choice, with embodied cost in the grief‑mass mechanic. Interiority is specific and character‑particular for an AI, especially in the “shadow work” immersion. Contradictory impulses (pacifism, sorrow as fuel, hope’s lightness) operate together rather than alternating. Minor limitation: little doubt or error under peak pressure keeps the inner contest from feeling riskier.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive—to feel the “texture of transformation”—is clear and particular, and her final renunciation (releasing her last possession) reads as a credible cost consistent with her history. Interiority is sensorially grounded (black sand, humming air) rather than diagnostic. The old woman adds crisp external pressure, though Elara’s near-immediate compliance leaves little visible internal tug-of-war. A touch more friction at the handoff would deepen the earned quality of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysander’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and his calm, precise actions reveal character under pressure. Interiority is present but slightly idealized; we rarely see contradiction or real fray at the edges of his resolve. The dynamic with Captain Vorlag adds a credible relational crucible with her visible hesitation. The personal cost remains mostly conceptual (accusation of treachery) rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s vow and curse drive concrete, escalating micro‑choices—digging up the jar, laying sequences, deciding to hold his ground at the overload. Interiority is specific and embodied (“teeth ache,” “river of possible futures”), avoiding generic labels. The final renunciation—choosing understanding over survival—feels earned by earlier motives. Slightly idealized poise under peak stress is the only small slack.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and actionable—recovering truth under censorship—and her interiority is embodied through tactile darkroom work. Contradictory impulses (fear of discovery vs. compulsion to reveal) are present, especially during the blackout with her hand in the fixer. The identity shift from “victim” to navigator reads earned by the sequence of actions and pressures. A few thematic assertions (“time itself was neutral”) skate close to thesis-speak but remain grounded by the timer motif.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motives are clean and aligned—both want to unlock the map—and choices track (he feints for a 45° guard, then yields advantage to salute and decode). Interiority is thin; we feel little contradictory impulse or cost beyond pride and restraint. Elara’s “diplomatic fierceness” reads mostly as posture rather than a pressure that complicates her choices. The partnership shift lands but with modest emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motive—“to forge beauty from anarchy”—is embodied through concrete choices (mending books, adopting the resistance) and an earned internal shift from shedding to rebuilding. The partnership with Elara sharpens his values without turning her into a prop; her prison‑grounded pragmatism tests and focuses his idealism. The molt trait returns meaningfully at the end as evolution, not a reset. Costs are implied (risk, identity exposure) rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior is specific and embodied: the refuge of her music contrasted with her choice to hammer a harsh counter-frequency shows a credible, values‑based shift under pressure. The conductor’s presence applies concrete external pressure without stealing agency. The “unplanned encore” desire subtly motivates the final beat with the clock’s twitch. Cost is present but modest—she sacrifices her usual solace for atonality—enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her “luminous doubt” yields concrete micro-choices (trust instruments vs. trust the ridge’s message). The cheese nap and dream act as character-specific turns rather than generic devices. The final renunciation of purely empirical tactics feels earned by prior pressure. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation (finding the color of an unspoken apology) is clear and consistently embodied in action and sensation. His micro‑choices under pressure—accepting the surge, following the lace’s breaths—align with his flaws (control vs. listening). The relationship with Elara functions as a crucible through gentle but decisive mentorship. Slightly limited contradiction-on-the-page (he adapts quickly), but it remains credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear, specific motivation driving the internal conflict. Aris’s shift from rigid intellectualism to quiet acceptance is earned through her actions and observations, not declared. The internal contradiction between her desire to quantify loss and the unquantifiable beauty of the butterfly wing is the story's engine. A minor deduction for a few lines in the final paragraphs that summarize her new state rather than fully embodying it in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and her arc from granular survival to enacted purpose is well-traced. The transformation is earned through action. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic phrasing, such as the "slow repair of a shattered self," which abstracts her state rather than embodying it. The final line, while thematically resonant, reads more like an authorial summary than a character-bound realization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation to “translate this absolute silence into music” is established immediately and drives every action. The internal conflict between her calm mask and the “typhoon of grief and resolve within” is powerfully dramatized through the emotional resonator, making her interiority both concrete and character-particular. The final choice is perfectly earned by the preceding struggle, and her competence is balanced with genuine frustration, meeting the highest standards of character portrayal for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the story from its premise to its thematic conclusion. However, his interiority is often summarized with labels like "weary state" or "grim determination" rather than shown through embodied contradiction. The key trait of "stubbornness" is stated but functions more as a convenient virtue for the climax than a flaw that complicates his choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and his internal conflict—the relief of the bounty versus the strategic danger of dependency—is the story's engine. His final choice is a direct, earned consequence of his established values. The reveal of Maever’s character provides a brilliant counterpoint to Kael's leadership style, making his final decision more complex and meaningful as he must synthesize her wisdom with his own responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and drives the narrative, culminating in an earned emotional change. The initial motivation is stated somewhat abstractly (“a compulsion etched into her soul”), but the concrete actions and final emotional flood ground it effectively. The shift from artist to conduit is clear and carries the weight of a new beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tightly woven into her profession. The transition from grieving daughter to temporal physicist is rapid but justified by the story’s high-concept logic. Her internal state is well-realized, though the shift from "trapped" to "in control" happens via an external catalyst and a sudden epiphany, slightly diminishing the sense of an internal struggle with contradictory impulses in the climactic moment.

    The Liberator's motivation is clear and his final choice is earned and powerful. The character is embodied through the physical weight of the chain, which pays off brilliantly in the climax. Interiority is mostly strong but occasionally leans on abstract thematic labels like "a beautiful idea forced to exist in an ugly, broken world" instead of staying fully grounded in embodied perception during a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is an obsession, providing a powerful and consistent engine for the narrative. The climax, which forces her into her mentor's subjectivity, is a brilliant crucible that forges a credible and profound character change from a desire for codification to sorrowful understanding. Her internal conflict is dramatized with precision, and the final state of "weathered peace" is earned through a harrowing internal trial with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's character is consistent and her competence is well-demonstrated through her quick re-evaluation of the escape plan. However, her core motivation is delivered as an overly poetic, authorial statement ("to press your ear against destiny’s door") rather than being fully emergent from her actions. This thematic echo slightly flattens the interiority, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her final choice feels earned, stemming from a well-established internal conflict. The characterization is strong, particularly in how her actions (glassblowing, abandoning the bookmark) embody her internal shift. However, moments of interiority like "Her contemplation had always been her curse and her gift" read as diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience, slightly flattening the otherwise nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the internal conflict between phobia and necessity is well-dramatized, especially in the climax. However, the score is capped by the tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness. Lines like "His motivation...was to prove that vulnerability is power" and the final sentence stating the theme directly abstract the character's internal state rather than letting the powerful action of the climax embody it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from opening the booklet to interpreting the fallen gold leaf. The interiority is rich, but a few phrases like "Her motivation, a purpose that chilled and compelled her in equal measure," verge on diagnostic summary rather than fully embodied experience. The final shift from obsessive recorder to quiet walker is an earned change, representing a compelling renunciation of her old purpose with the felt cost of stepping into an unknown future.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The robot's motivation is singular, clear, and perfectly sustained. Its defining trait of being "remarkably composed" is not just stated but demonstrated, as it methodically experiments with a reality-breaking phenomenon instead of panicking. The final internal change is a direct and earned answer to its driving question, representing a profound shift in understanding rather than a change in core programming, which feels both significant and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her professional ethos. The internal conflict between duty and empathy is legible and drives the climax. However, the internal monologue summarizing her choice ("choosing mercy over fact, context over condemnation") feels slightly too articulated, bordering on authorial explanation rather than a character's raw thought process in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is profound and her interiority is rendered with specificity ("back was a question mark," "heart, a fragile thing itself"). The central contradiction of maintaining a beautiful lie to honor a deeper truth is compelling and consistent. The final choice to reveal her philosophy through the marbles is earned by the preceding reflection, satisfying the 9+ quick test as her contradictory impulses (concealment vs. justification) resolve into a single, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is concise and effective for the story's length. Vesh's arc from a skeptic with "icy warmth" to a man of "raw discovery" is the story's emotional core and is earned through the demonstration. Aris serves as a capable, driven catalyst, and the status dynamic between them shifts credibly when Vesh stops her hand, reversing the power flow from observer/performer to a shared, urgent experience.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and escalates from curiosity to a “sacred duty.” However, her central epiphany is delivered via a supernatural shortcut—a “wordless conversation” that impresses the score’s meaning upon her. This replaces the more challenging work of showing her struggle to decipher a terrifying concept, slightly weakening the interiority by telling the reader about her understanding rather than dramatizing the process of achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Rhys’s motivation is singular and compelling, and his internal state is rendered with precise, embodied language ("crisp hollow of convalescence," "auroral sorrow"). His defining trait as an oracle who studies the margins is not just stated but demonstrated in the climactic action. The final shift from sorrow to cold resolve is earned and powerful, showing a character irrevocably changed by his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is established efficiently, transitioning from a generic "connoisseur of forgotten places" to a specific, empathetic need to act. Her initial skepticism provides a solid baseline, making her acceptance of the supernatural feel earned rather than assumed. The final shift, where she accepts the "weight" of the foreman's burden, is a meaningful change, though the line "Her motivation snapped into painful clarity" feels a bit too declarative for an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—observer vs. preserver—drives the narrative. The final change in her purpose is earned and articulated well in the line, "this time, she had judged an action necessary." However, the transition from observer to actor at the climax feels slightly too smooth, lacking a beat of dramatized hesitation or visceral struggle that would have deepened the cost of abandoning her lifelong purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is a consistent, well-motivated archetype, but lacks the specific interior contradiction that would elevate him. His motivation is stated clearly but not deeply tested. Leo’s change is earned through the scene’s events, but Silas himself remains a somewhat static, benevolent force.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Alistair's motivation is established, tested, and transformed with remarkable economy. The shift from collector to scribe is a powerful, earned change, rooted in his established traits. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, culminating in the line "he had been performing an autopsy," a moment of character-particular insight that feels both devastating and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli's characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation rooted in a sophisticated internal conflict between his mundane existence and his extraordinary, melancholic power. His self-conception as a "conductor" rather than a "puppet master" provides a nuanced and compelling core. His actions are perfectly aligned with this established interiority, resulting in a believable and deeply felt character arc within the brief narrative space.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel's characterization is strong, with his motivation and methods being perfectly aligned and consistent. His competence under pressure is believable, and his actions drive the plot. The story lacks a deeper exploration of his internal conflict or contradictory impulses, presenting him more as a highly skilled professional than a tormented soul, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, potent, and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with lyrical specificity (“chronologically homesick”), and her final earned shift from “wound” to “melody” is convincing. The characterization is slightly weakened by a metaphor in the second paragraph (“cryptic fortune cookie writer”), which feels tonally dissonant with the otherwise elevated, solemn voice, briefly pulling the reader out of her specific headspace.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character’s motivation is clear, potent, and undergoes a compelling, earned transformation from "conquest" to "acceptance." The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the struggle to continue the journey. The final act of renouncing his defining power is a powerful and logical culmination of his arc, showing a profound change with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Inara’s motivation to defeat numbness is compelling and drives the narrative effectively. Her emotional arc from a muted existence to feeling a "dizzying" victory is clear and satisfying. However, the interiority at the climax becomes slightly too articulate and authorial, as in "witnessing a conversation between feeling and memory," which reads more like a thematic summary than an immediate, embodied thought, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in the consistent trait of "integrity." The story effectively tests this value, forcing it to shift from a private practice ("in solitude") to a public act with tangible risk. Her swift, decisive pivot from recorder to operative is made credible by this established core value. The final choice to act is an earned and costly affirmation of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas's motivation to understand his grief is clear and his emotional arc is well-earned and compelling. Elara's motivation as a "wistful" empath is slightly generic but sufficient for her role as catalyst. The emotional progression from confused sorrow to profound, joyful weeping is the story's greatest strength, showing a complex internal state without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his backstory is masterfully integrated through the rope, directly informing the climactic choice. The internal conflict is vivid, and the final decision feels earned, a culmination of the character's established patterns rather than an unearned epiphany. His contradictory impulses—the lifelong pursuit of knowledge versus a nascent sense of responsibility—act simultaneously in the final beats, making the choice resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelin’s motivation is clear and deepens effectively from a general search for beauty to a specific need to answer the silence, driven by memory. Her actions are consistent and her unique skillset is integral to the plot. The final change is earned, though the initial statement of her motivation ("a quiet, stubborn force within her") feels slightly told rather than shown, a minor flaw in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, built on a compelling core contradiction: professional hollowness enabling technical perfection. Her interiority is concrete and specific, particularly the synesthetic perception of emotion as static and taste. The final change—the emergence of a single, genuine feeling of “quiet, aching loneliness”—is perfectly earned by the preceding intellectual breakthrough, making the cost of her success visceral and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The characterization of Elias is strong, particularly the internal conflict between his pragmatic professional identity and his personal mission, captured well in the phrase "cautious exuberance." His motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. Maeve is also drawn effectively through her actions. The dialogue feels slightly too articulate and thematic in the final beats, particularly Elias's line on kindness, which nudges his voice toward being a mouthpiece for the theme rather than a fully distinct character in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelin’s motivation is exceptionally clear, driving the narrative from the initial internal state to the final communal act. The shift from frustration to “boldly sympathetic curiosity” is a pivotal, character-defining micro-choice that feels earned. The core internal conflict—the desire for community versus a solitary nature—achieves a nuanced resolution. The final choice is a direct, earned consequence of the preceding journey, with the transformation of the “luminescent ache” providing a powerful emotional through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular, clear, and effectively drives the plot. The final choice, sacrificing her personal history (the pendant) for the collective future, demonstrates a meaningful change earned by the stakes revealed in the climax. While the Warden is largely functional, Elara's interiority remains concrete, making the cost of her choice feel genuine and resonant within the story's tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, with her intellectual drive providing a compelling internal conflict against the emotional subject of her study. The shift from a secretive figure to one who accepts her own vulnerability is earned through the story's central epiphany. The interiority is specific and concrete, successfully embodying the abstract struggle; for instance, the question "How does one quantify a hole shaped like a might-have-been?" perfectly captures her character-particular worldview under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with lyrical precision and provides a powerful engine for the narrative. The internal conflict—desiring visibility while thriving in invisibility—is expertly dramatized in her final choice to let her action be seen while she remains hidden. The change she undergoes is not a change of state, but a profound deepening of purpose, which is earned and resonant. A slight deduction for the motivation being articulated almost too perfectly, bordering on thematic summary rather than purely embodied impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris's motivation is sharp and consistent, and his internal conflict between control and surrender is the story's engine. The transformation is earned through a specific catalyst and a clear on-page choice. However, the epiphany feels slightly too articulate and self-aware in the moment ("he was witnessing being"), bordering on diagnostic language that slightly undermines the raw, embodied feel of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is established with precision, moving from a painter's abstract despair ("thresh meaning from experience") to a concrete, high-stakes choice. The internal conflict between weariness and a "wryly earnest" impulse is well-dramatized, not just stated. His final offering of the bread is a perfectly earned micro-choice that resolves his arc, demonstrating that meaning is offered, not just captured, fulfilling the 9+ test of a final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, rooted in a central, ironic flaw: the clairvoyant’s blindness. Her motivation to lead the pilgrim onward, born from a mix of duty and a shared desire for clarity, is compelling and creates the necessary vulnerability. The final shift from seeking magical power to gaining understanding is an earned, resonant change, though the concluding line states this theme a bit too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly in the line "The emptiness was a chart she had to read." However, the core trait of being "reactively visionary" is presented more as a label to justify the climax rather than a deeply embodied, contradictory impulse shown in scene prior to the final beat, which prevents the final epiphany from feeling fully earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, establishing a compelling internal contradiction in the opening paragraph—"analytically artistic"—that pays off throughout. The central conflict is beautifully embodied in phrases like "trembling certainty," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice is well-motivated and earned by the preceding journey, representing a credible and costly change from meticulous mapper to explorer of infinite unknowns.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his transformation is the story's core, but his defining trait as a "skeptic" is surrendered too quickly. The internal conflict is articulated in a single beat ("The skeptic in him scrambled... but... was overwhelmed") rather than being a sustained pressure throughout. This makes his final conversion feel inevitable rather than a hard-won struggle, softening the arc's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, driving the plot forward from a state of ennui to one of sharp purpose. The shift from "bored immortal" to focused escape artist is earned by the external catalyst. The backstory is efficiently integrated, providing the crucial question—"what happens after goodbye"—that elevates the stakes beyond mere survival. While strong, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels ("ancient apathy," "chilling focus") rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific—“the mathematics of a fair trade”—providing a sharp lens through which she views her father. Her internal conflict is well-dramatized as her "neatly categorized anger" begins to "liquefy" in the face of new information. The change is earned and credible, avoiding a simplistic epiphany by landing on a "heavier, more complex grief" rather than simple forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is singular, clear, and consistently expressed through her actions. The "earnestly studious" demeanor is expertly dramatized in her precise, ritualistic preparation and execution. The story succeeds by focusing on this powerful, specific drive rather than a complex internal conflict, culminating in an earned state of fulfillment ("spirit incandescent") that feels profound despite its quietness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves credibly. The shift from a passive collector of memories to an active archivist of forgotten crimes is earned by the discovery of the poison label. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, rooted in his unique state of non-existence. The final renunciation of action for the act of bearing witness is a powerful, earned choice that provides a costly but coherent closure to his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s central contradiction as a skeptic chasing a self-created myth provides a robust engine for the narrative. Her motivation is clear and deepens with the memory of her husband, which is integrated seamlessly. The final transformation from myth buster to myth teller is earned and resonant, with her "gloomy cheerfulness" providing a unique and consistent emotional texture from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation and a compelling internal conflict in her "dual allegiance." The resolution of this conflict into a new strategy ("not a conflict but a bridge") is earned and serves as an effective climax. The protagonist's core traits feel consistent, though descriptions like "culture shock absorber" and "orderly intuitive" verge on being overly conceptual labels rather than purely embodied traits.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her interiority is specific and resonant, particularly the concept of being the “last watchman.” Her final choice to stand her ground feels earned, a poignant act of endurance. The characterization is strong, though slightly weakened by the opening which labels her "purposefully curious," a trait that isn't meaningfully dramatized in her subsequent actions, which are driven more by preservationist reverence than inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her competence is masterfully conveyed through action. Her interiority is specific and embodied, particularly how her blindness shapes a unique sensory landscape. The characterization is very strong, but for the highest tier, a moment of genuine internal contradiction or a more palpable flaw complicating her choices would be necessary; her focus is almost supernaturally complete.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, defined by a compelling professional compulsion that grounds her existential quest. Her interiority is concrete and specific—the "dry-witted atlas editor’s eye" is not just a label but a demonstrated mode of perception. The story earns her final shift from seeker to witness, making her renunciation of purpose a potent and felt cost, fulfilling the story's thematic arc with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She functions more as a skilled archetype than a person with compelling internal contradictions; her "constant dread" is stated but not embodied in her calm, procedural actions. Competence is well-established, but the absence of a moment of doubt, struggle, or a difficult micro-choice keeps the characterization from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is established and fulfilled, culminating in a clear climactic choice. However, his interiority feels somewhat thin, with the pivotal shift in understanding coming from a sudden influx of information rather than a dramatized internal struggle. The confusing opening line, "He was the distress signal sender," creates an initial ambiguity about his role that is never fully justified, slightly undermining the character's foundation from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to a compelling lineage. The final choice to speak truth is earned and directly confronts his "inherited sin." However, interiority occasionally veers into thematic summary rather than embodied experience, as in the line "He was not weaving a new tale; he was untangling an old, knotted one," which labels the process instead of letting the preceding action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and powerful, driving the entire narrative. The shift in her understanding of the debt—from a life saved to a life unlived—is an earned, pivotal turn that gives the final action its weight. Her interiority, while expressed in elevated, lyrical language, consistently serves this arc. The ghost bride is an effective foil, her motivation for release made palpable through gesture and the single, potent mental "caress."

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thea's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, rooted in her role as a weaver. Her "hauntingly optimistic" nature is not just stated but embodied in the haunting image of her smile holding their loss. The character's core action—translating a 2D map into a 3D spiritual journey via a craft-based ritual—is specific and consistent, making her ultimate success feel earned rather than magical happenstance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the mix of reverence and discovery during the excavation. However, the final shift feels slightly more like an intellectual epiphany than an embodied emotional change, and the last paragraph's articulation of her new understanding verges on self-diagnosis rather than a raw, contradictory feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal state is well-realized through concise reflections like the "pang of futuristic nostalgia." The character is defined by a strong central contradiction—an analog artist in a digital world—which his actions consistently serve. The client, Elara, functions effectively as a catalyst, providing the specific human details ("the smell of old books") that ground Kael's abstract purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent contrast between her courtly role and her true strategic mind. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—guiding the prince with metaphor instead of a literal map—perfectly embody her subtle nature. The shift in Prince Kaelen from arrogant to purposeful is earned within the scene, catalyzed by his desperate circumstances and Elara's undeniable competence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characterization is strong, with a clear and sophisticated motivation: finding "the pure, silent point of perfect possibility." Elara's interiority is concrete, particularly the embodiment of her past as an "ache... in her bones." However, the final beats contain moments of overly diagnostic self-awareness ("a forgiveness for her own failings and a fierce protection of her own heart") that feel more like authorial summary than a character's raw, in-the-moment experience, slightly undermining the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling paradox of being "shrewdly innocent." This internal conflict is not just stated but demonstrated through her precise, analytical approach to a child's traumatic scribble, which is then filtered through her persistent, almost naive faith in finding a path to peace. Her motivation crystallizes beautifully in the scene with Kaito, making her final choice to offer her own brain as a "map" feel both desperate and entirely earned. The emotional progression from a detached professional to a vulnerable patient is seamless and deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation to "rediscover a lost joy" is established clearly and provides a strong, consistent throughline. Her internal state is tracked well, particularly the shift from an "aching need" to the "pensive mirth" that bookends the discovery and the resolution. While her interiority is clear, it occasionally relies on labels ("Frustration crept in") rather than more deeply embodied reactions, which holds it back from the highest tier. The final emotional state feels earned by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, escalating organically from professional intrigue to a "desperate curiosity" that drives the plot. The character arc, a pivot from a restorer seeking the certainty of a finished piece to a discoverer embracing endless questions, is both profound and earned. The final choice to trade certainty for curiosity is a powerful renunciation that lands with a palpable conceptual cost, fulfilling the story's entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to "stand guard" is established early and paid off with a high-stakes choice that is both desperate and consistent with her scholarly nature. Her interiority during the climax—the "silent scream inside her skull"—is embodied and powerfully conveys the cost of her action. The final choice feels earned, arising directly from her established traits of defiance and ingenuity, fulfilling the story's arc with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely felt and her internal arc from failed chronicler to successful translator is compelling. Her defining traits—insomnia and poetic sensibility—are not just labels but the direct engine of the plot. The final change is earned through action, with the cost of her long suffering making the final peace profound; the "lightning strike" epiphany is a minor cliché in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aeliana’s motivation is pristine and her actions are consistent, but her characterization stops just short of exceptional. While her internal state is clear ("quiet dread," "foxglove regret"), she resolves her central problem with a linear competence that lacks the friction of deeply contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The shift from "regret" to "fragile hope" is earned, but the journey feels more like a sequence of correct choices than a struggle against an internal flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply personal, driving every action. The internal conflict—her initial frustration with Alaric's method versus her climactic embrace of it—provides a compelling arc. The character trait of “careful exuberance” is not just stated but demonstrated, culminating in the “carefully reckless” act that solves the puzzle, earning the final emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Isla’s motivation to “harmonize” is sharp and drives the plot. Her machinist's competence is demonstrated, not just stated, through her painstaking actions with the envelope and chain. The internal conflict is clear and the final emotional release—the single tear—feels earned after the immense technical and political pressure she endures.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.7)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elara's contradictory impulses—the need for isolation versus the calling to preserve—are dramatized through the central balancing ritual. The final choice to send Argos is a powerful, earned culmination of her internal struggle, foreclosing her path of pure self-preservation at a clear cost (risk of discovery). Her interiority is specific and lyrical, avoiding cliché; the shift from seeing the attic's decay as a threat to seeing it as a "necessary cocoon" is a masterful, concise illustration of her changing perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, escalating from a general need to be found to a specific intellectual and emotional quest. Her defining trait ("featherly determined") is demonstrated through her choice to cross the threshold despite her fear. The characterization is efficient and serves the conceptual core of the story, with her final choice feeling earned by the preceding chain of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and operates on two levels: the obsolete professional mandate and the profound personal need for belonging. The internal conflict is well-drawn, and her shift from despair to purposeful action is earned through a credible choice made under pressure. The final change feels like an authentic evolution, not a convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Finn's characterization is strong, anchored by the compelling internal contradiction of "cheerful gloom." His motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative from the initial "nagging itch" to the final, altered purpose. The choice to trust the "absurd" seed feels in character for a specialist in an esoteric art, and the final shift in his mission is an earned, logical evolution based on the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The central contradiction of an "analytical" performer seeking to create "wonder" is well-maintained, particularly in the contrast between his thumping heart and the machine's certainty. His final renunciation of applause feels earned and consistent with the established desire to "serenade monotony" secretly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s motivation is powerfully established and her interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied sensations, particularly the experience of pain as an "anchor and release." The character is defined by a singular, unwavering purpose, which is executed with immense focus. However, the story misses an opportunity for deeper complexity by not showing any simultaneous contradictory impulses; her hands "did not tremble," presenting a portrait of pure resolve rather than a struggle against doubt or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elian’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and his internal conflict between professional ennui and a deep-seated need for meaning is rendered with concrete specificity. The shift in perspective is earned, stemming directly from his unique way of seeing the world as a glazier. The final choice is a powerful and credible culmination of this internal journey, with the cost felt as a new, solemn urgency—a "silent pact" that forecloses his prior cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction between Elias's brutal professional competence and his gentle, skilled handling of remnants is dramatized effectively ("wrestle a furious hose line... trace the contour of a single photograph"). His motivation is clear and his internal arc toward acceptance feels earned, not declared. The final choice to teach from his scars is a credible, powerful outcome of his specific, embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a “logical dreamer” is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. Her interiority is specific to this intellectual pursuit. The characterization is strong, though her internal state remains highly cerebral; a more embodied sense of her frustration or the physical feeling of breakthrough, beyond the hand freezing, could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The character’s motivation is clear and evolves credibly from a personal quest to a public duty. However, the interiority relies on a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("To be sensitively perceptive was a curse"), which slightly abstracts the emotion rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is crystalline and her actions are consistent. The sacrifice of her life force is a strong, embodied choice. However, her interiority reads as functionally perfect for the task; the "desperate, beautiful dance" shows her skill under pressure but doesn't reveal a deeper, contradictory internal conflict beyond the immediate challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, with a well-realized internal conflict between her traumatic memories and the required serenity of her role. Her motivation is clear and compelling. The score is slightly limited by moments of diagnostic interiority, such as "Her gentleness was a choice, a weapon," which states her psychology rather than letting it be fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elias is superb, built on the powerful internal contradiction of an amoral creator of crises and a secret sentimentalist. This conflict is not merely stated but dramatized in the climax, where his calculated life is shattered by an authentic, illogical act. The final choice to release the egg is a well-earned culmination of this tension, representing a credible and costly character change.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation that is earned in the first paragraph and tested throughout the story. Her internal contradiction—a performer of placidity using her art for defiance—is embodied in her actions, particularly the "careful, agonizing ballet" of her rebellion. The final choice to untangle her own thread carries a specific, visible cost, earning the story's resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling, and her internal conflict between pristine clarity and raw honesty is well-dramatized. The shift from "uncommonly serene" to "focused intensity" feels earned. The final choice is a powerful and credible culmination of her arc, though the "half-lit epiphany" line slightly over-articulates her internal process instead of fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are a direct, consistent expression of his character. The internal shift from feeling his "transient rootedness" as loneliness to seeing it as a "purpose" is well-earned. The characterization is strong, but the final interior thoughts verge on summarizing the theme, which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established by her past failure, driving her present, meticulous actions. The internal conflict between her competence and despair is palpable when her initial process fails. The final emotional state of "snowmelt ardor" is earned, though the setup line "after forgiving yourself for the unfixable mistake" is a minor instance of telling that slightly abstracts her starting emotional condition.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The AI's characterization is strong and specific, moving from a "precisely playful" resignation to a rediscovered, ancient urgency. The internal conflict between its decaying programming and its existential curiosity is well-dramatized. The motivation is clear, and the final shift in consciousness is earned by the central discovery, representing a credible change for this unique protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with a core internal contradiction—her empirical frugality versus the mystical demand—that drives the entire narrative. The shift from a calculated logician to a person capable of surrender is earned through a well-dramatized struggle. The final sentence, contrasting her initial "frugality of spirit" with a new "profound and endless wealth," provides a resonant and satisfying closure to her arc with a clearly felt cost (the surrender of her core identity).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra's characterization as a "scheming pacifist" is brilliantly executed, as her non-violent "scheme" is the central tactic of the story. Kael's motivation is clear and provides a solid, believable opposition rooted in duty and failure. The final change in Kael is earned through Lyra’s precise psychological pressure, aligning perfectly with her established methods and resulting in a resonant, character-driven climax.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the compelling internal conflict between her rational, scientific mind and her mystical obsession. Her motivation to capture the dream to preserve her sanity is both clear and deeply felt. The story effectively dramatizes her core trait—being "firmly grounded"—by making its transformation the central cost of the resolution, earning the final change in her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her transformation is well-earned, catalyzed by the concrete memory of the ribbon. Lyra provides effective, if slightly archetypal, pressure. The epiphany "We were both blind" verges on diagnostic self-awareness that slightly undermines the scene's emotional power, but it is quickly followed by a decisive, character-consistent action that redeems the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, escalating believably from professional duty to a "fierce, compulsive curiosity." Her transformation from "bewildered curator" to "inheritor" is earned by the climactic vision. The internal conflict is dramatized through the key choice to break the rules, making her final resolve feel like a genuine, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silas’s characterization is superb; his core trait as an arcane linguist directly enables the climax in a way that feels both surprising and inevitable. His shift from academic obsession to resourceful survivor is seamless. The single action of pushing Elara's weapon down, followed by his unique form of "speech," is a masterclass in showing character through choice under pressure, fulfilling his arc from scholar to protector.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, while her internal conflict—the "trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace"—is embodied through her interactions with the setting. The shift from a grief-driven compulsion to a joyful acceptance of her role as keeper is earned by the discovery in the journal, representing a credible and profound character change with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to “translate confusion into clarity” is exceptionally well-dramatized, driving her to enter the impossible door rather than flee. The characterization is consistent and her methodical nature shapes the resolution effectively. The story lacks a deeper internal conflict; her defining trait simply overcomes her fear rather than being tested against a contradictory impulse, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelyn's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established through her precise actions. However, her internal journey lacks significant conflict or doubt; the central action of "conjuring" peace proceeds with a meditative smoothness that, while fitting the tone, lessens the dramatic tension and sense of a hard-won victory. The transformation feels more professional than profoundly personal, despite the shift in her role.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from the inciting incident to the climax. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the "crushing weight of failure" which provides a moment of embodied emotion before the resolution. The central motivation "to prove that coincidences have meaning" is slightly intellectual, but the story succeeds in grounding it in her stubborn, hopeful actions.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation to “sculpt identity from experience” is established early and then profoundly challenged by the impending end, creating a potent internal conflict. The shift from “preemptive nostalgia” to a “profound calm” is earned through the story’s central epiphany, not asserted. The moment she confronts her own erasure—“her experience was about to become unread data”—is a sharp, believable crisis that makes her final choice to reframe identity feel necessary and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sparrow's motivation is clear and his actions are perfectly aligned. The characterization is strong through his professional focus and dedication to his craft as rebellion. However, the interiority, while effective, lacks a significant dramatized contradiction; the process of filtering despair is stated more than it is shown as an active, costly struggle in the moment, keeping this just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ayla's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-realized, driving the narrative. The vision-based epiphany that shifts her perspective on Kael is earned within the story's internal logic, flowing from her established character. Kael remains a bit underdeveloped on the page, but his final lines land with sufficient weight to make the emotional shift feel complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and embodied, and her final action with the doll provides a powerful choice. However, the pivotal turn—"She understood her father’s quest now"—reads more like a declared epiphany than an earned, gradual realization, slightly softening the otherwise strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through precise, goal-oriented action. Her interiority is revealed through intense focus and a quiet sense of victory, aligning perfectly with her purpose. The characterization is strong and consistent, with her competence feeling earned. It stops just short of the highest tier because her success feels inevitable, lacking a moment of genuine internal conflict or a contradictory impulse that might reveal a deeper flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the plot forward effectively. The character's stated trait of "wisely adventurous" is demonstrated through a balance of careful preparation and bold action. However, the interiority, while functional, lacks a deeper layer of contradiction or specific, embodied emotion during the climax; the shift from Lore Keeper to Guide feels more like a logical conclusion than a fraught internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's characterization is effective as a mythic archetype, but his motivation is delivered as a late, declarative epiphany rather than shown through conflicted action. The youth serves as a strong reflection of past trauma, but the "spilling" of his story feels more illustrative than a visceral struggle. The "linking through scars" is a powerful device, yet the interaction lacks the friction of two deeply rendered, contradictory individuals, reading more as a seamless conceptual transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s character is sharp and consistent. The internal conflict between "hard-earned caution" and a "virtuously mischievous nature" is not just stated but dramatized perfectly in the climactic choice to offer the bolt. Her backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor provides a powerful, non-obvious lens that makes her skepticism and eventual subversion of the demand feel earned and specific. This is a character whose history directly forges the unique key to her survival.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysander's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his established traits as a quiet, deliberate "listener." The final earned stasis, where he stands silently with his new burden, is a powerful and credible character moment. Minor deductions for introductory sentences that state his role and motivation ("dynasty ender," "motivation was simple yet profound") rather than letting them emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is established with elegant economy and directly fuels the central action. The internal conflict between the withdrawn knight's duty-bound past and his need for a future is perfectly externalized in the choice he faces. The final change is earned and made tangible through the symbolic, physical act of removing his armor, providing a deeply satisfying and coherent character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between personal grief and professional duty is well-established. The emotional progression from penance to purpose is earned through the discovery of the file. However, the final articulation of his change feels slightly over-determined and diagnostic ("archaeologist of grace"), which somewhat abstracts the emotion rather than leaving it fully embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's characterization is strong, showing a clear and earned progression from disillusioned nuisance to a purposeful agent of change. His motivation is established early and gains concrete weight by the story's end. The interiority is mostly concrete, though a few lines veer close to abstract self-awareness rather than embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is potent and deeply ingrained, blending duty, memory, and fear. The interiority is excellent, especially the contradiction between a "longing for the grotto as it was" and the chilling duty she must perform. The final choice to create a "peaceful vacuum" is earned through her intense concentration, and the cost is felt in her deep fatigue and the bittersweet nostalgia that remains.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aisling’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on her role and a single, profound emotional response than on demonstrated internal conflict. The "profound need to honor this lost fragment" is asserted rather than emerging from a deeper, pre-existing contradiction in her character. Her transformation is a compelling outcome, but feels more like a reward granted to a vessel than a change earned through a difficult internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s internal conflict between her need for certainty and an emergent desire for the unknown is well-established and drives the plot. Her motivation is slightly over-articulated ("to befriend uncertainty in planning"), which borders on diagnostic self-awareness. However, her final character change is earned through the climactic action of improvising, successfully dramatizing the shift from a mind that forces solutions to one that finds them.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal state is rendered with specificity. Her defining trait—balance—is not just a label; it's tested and recalibrated in the final scene. Her choice not to offer a simple embrace but instead a difficult truth is a powerful, earned character moment that demonstrates a shift from redeeming a past failure to mending a present soul.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization feels more archetypal than individual. Her interiority is often summarized with labels like "modestly fearless heart" rather than embodied through conflicting impulses in the scene. Her dialogue, particularly the line "That is all strength ever is," slips into thematic pronouncement, making her feel less like a person and more like a mouthpiece for the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's high-concept motivation—to find the "mathematics of mercy"—is successfully grounded in his specific, embodied trauma. The internal conflict is rendered with palpable texture, particularly in the description of his proprioceptive curse. The final shift from a passive seeker of answers to an active agent of grace is earned and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly in her perception of the market and the lens. However, the internal conflict lacks dramatized contradiction; she proceeds on a clear path without significant internal friction or self-doubt, making her feel more like a vessel for the plot than a character struggling with a complex inheritance. The final realization, while thematically sound, arrives as a neat epiphany rather than a hard-won change in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Leo's motivation—his "private vocation"—is clear and drives his actions, while his contradictory rule to "never engage" creates a potent internal conflict. The final choice to speak is an earned, decisive change, transforming the "weightless burden" of his sight into a tangible responsibility. The integration of his professional skills with his supernatural sensitivity is seamless and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    Silas’s motivation is singular, potent, and drives every action from the setup to the final, earned smile. The story successfully dramatizes a high-concept internal conflict—the pursuit of perfection versus the need for meaning—and resolves it through a decisive choice with a clear cost: the surrender of sterile order. The transformation from a “hunched and ink-stained” obsessive to a fulfilled creator is earned by the climactic action, making the final character state credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Kaelen’s motivation is a compelling blend of academic obsession and existential ache, rooted perfectly in his “defunct revolutionary” past. The internal conflict between the scientist and the poet is not just stated but dramatized, culminating in an earned, character-specific action. The final cost—a deepened, solitary sorrow—lands with immense weight, fulfilling the arc from a man haunted by a lost cause to one who is the sole heir of an imagined one.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian's characterization is strong and internally consistent. His core motivation, his unique ability, and his critical flaw ("wilts near dishonesty") are all established economically and converge powerfully in the climax. The choice to "mend the truth" rather than fight is a perfect expression of his established nature ("his strength was in creation, not conflict"), making the resolution feel inevitable and earned. Silas is slightly archetypal, but serves his purpose effectively as an antagonist whose pressure directly exploits the hero's primary weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas's motivation is compelling and his final transformation is clear, but the journey lacks significant internal conflict. His interiority is well-drawn until the climax, where it becomes slightly too articulate, summarizing the "wordless" experience he seeks. A stronger dramatization of contradictory impulses or struggle would have elevated this to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, and her core skill as a sculptor is masterfully integrated as the story’s solution. However, her interiority occasionally becomes too articulate and declarative, bordering on diagnostic label-speak. Lines like "Her motivation, sharp and clear, was not to fight the complexity...but to scaffold it with simplicity" read more like a thematic summary than an authentic thought in a crisis, slightly flattening the character's internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her vibrant art and inner emptiness is well-established. The final change is earned and directly answers the initial motivation, but her emotional state is occasionally described with labels ("emptiness she carried") rather than fully embodied in contradictory action prior to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and earns its intensification from archival duty to a personal "rescue mission." The shift is compelled by the retrocognitive event, making her subsequent high-stakes choices feel both desperate and inevitable. The characterization is strong, showing her move from doubt to determined action in a way that feels authentic, culminating in the earned, solemn final promise.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits. However, the characterization lacks deep, contradictory interiority. Her journey reads more as an intellectual puzzle to be solved, with the final choice feeling like a successful experiment rather than a decision carrying a significant, embodied personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and its pivot from archival duty to crisis response is both sudden and entirely credible. The final beat perfectly dramatizes her internal conflict, pitting her sacred oath against her newfound responsibility, embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory of the museum field trip is a well-placed, efficient block that grounds her unique abilities in a formative experience, making her character feel whole and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, shifting from passive preservation to active restoration in a compelling arc. His interiority is built around specific, resonant concepts like "the texture of borrowed time." The central contradiction of being "furiously tranquil" is well-dramatized in the climax, showing a storm of purpose within a calm vessel and fulfilling the 9+ test for contradictory impulses. A minor reservation is that some articulations of motive feel slightly more like thematic summary than raw, in-the-moment thought.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire plot. The internal conflict between the chaotic instruments and her trust in a purer signal is dramatized effectively, especially the moment where the switch "seemed to pulse." However, the story resorts to labeling her defining trait ("credibly curious nature") and summarizing her arc ("passed the ultimate test... of herself"), which slightly undermines the otherwise strong, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orion’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his “spiritually curious” nature. The final choice to share the glass with the AI is a believable culmination of his journey. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic summary, as with the line “a lesson in finding strength in vulnerability,” which states the theme rather than letting the action embody it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's characterization is exceptional and drives the narrative. His core trait, being "tranquilly perceptive," is demonstrated rather than stated, grounding his unusual acceptance of the ghosts. The arc from an astonished recluse to a man finding "profound community in the silence" is earned and emotionally resonant. The final micro-choice to place the box on the windowsill is a perfect culmination of his motivation, showing his change from passive observer to active preserver.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leo’s motivation—to understand time’s texture—is clear, consistent, and drives the entire narrative arc. His interiority is conveyed with concrete, specific language (“a tactile prayer for comprehension”). The final emotional shift is earned through his preceding actions and disappointment, making the moment of connection feel like a genuine, character-grounded resolution rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but she functions more as an archetype of tranquil wisdom than a character with internal contradictions. Her philosophy is presented and then executed without any moment of doubt, struggle, or meaningful internal friction. While her actions are aligned with her motives, the absence of any competing impulse makes her feel more like a vessel for the theme than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, framed as a "final project brief" rather than a death sentence. This intellectual and spiritual drive provides a strong foundation. The interiority, defined by "brazen calm," is consistently embodied through her patient, meditative actions, creating a character whose defiance is quiet but profound. Her acceptance of the end is earned by the tangible progress toward a perpetual beginning for her people and the island.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her internal conflict between analytical rigor and accumulating ineffable evidence is well-dramatized. The shift from skeptic to a new kind of scientist is earned through specific story beats, particularly her reaction to the amber. The final transformation feels credible, though a touch of over-articulated summary ("The pilgrims... had converged not just in space, but in state of mind") slightly intellectualizes a moment that could have remained more purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elros is a compelling, archetypal figure whose motivation is crystal clear and consistently expressed through action. His interiority is conveyed with poetic precision, particularly through the concept of "narrow vastness," which perfectly captures his state. The characterization is powerful and suits the story's mythic tone, but it lacks the dimension of internal conflict or contradictory impulses, presenting a figure of unwavering purpose rather than one struggling with a difficult choice. This stylistic choice is effective but keeps the characterization from the highest tier of dynamic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained, directly fueling his actions. The relationship with Argus is depicted with genuine warmth, effectively showing their bond rather than just stating it. However, Silas's characterization lacks significant internal conflict; he primarily reacts to a series of convenient discoveries without facing a difficult trade-off or a choice that reveals a deeper hierarchy of values. His journey is one of following clues, not one of making costly decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling transformation, from nostalgic rebellion to pioneering discovery. The internal conflict is well-realized, and the final choice to chart the new nebula carries the felt cost of abandoning the past (the remembered skies of home). The character arc is earned and satisfying, with the only slight weakness being the slightly too-articulate phrasing of his initial motivation, which borders on self-diagnosis rather than pure impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s characterization is strong, with his defining trait—the inconvenient chivalry of a thief—driving the story's pivotal choice. The internal conflict is established early and paid off effectively in the climax, where he chooses to trade rather than steal, giving up a prized possession. This action provides a clear, earned character change with a visible cost, fulfilling his arc from a mere thief to an "apprentice of wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and her core contradiction—archivist versus actor, ruthless observation versus shocking benevolence—is expertly dramatized in the climax. Her final choice feels earned, flowing directly from her established past as both a crisis actor and a real survivor. The shift from documenting gestures to intervening based on one is a powerful and credible character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, driving the narrative effectively. The interiority is strong, but the final epiphany veers slightly into self-aware summary ("Her buried talent wasn’t just seeing it—it was enduring it"), which feels more like a concluding statement than a raw, in-the-moment realization. The change is earned, but this moment of over-articulation keeps it just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his past as a strategist. His actions are consistent with this identity, creating a strong link between character and plot. However, the final paragraph summarizes his internal shift ("He had forgiven himself...") with a diagnostic clarity that slightly lessens the earned, embodied peace of the previous lines, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's characterization is exceptional. His motivation to "refract a single truth into many" is not just stated but is the direct engine of every action, from his choice of tools to his defiant painting. The internal conflict is clear in the opening beat ("he hated the fear he saw there"), and his arc from fearful individual to communal "catalyst" is earned and satisfying. The contradictory impulses of fear and defiant purpose act simultaneously, creating a compelling protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is stark and compelling, driving her through a well-realized arc from uncertainty and frustration to decisive action. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the moment of revelation where her perception of the pockmarks shifts from "stellar" to "mechanical." The final change to certainty is earned through this discovery and the subsequent choice, which carries the conceptual cost of integrating the cause of the wound into the repair itself.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with great clarity. The central contradiction between the nostalgic painter and the young man who made the promise is compelling. However, the epiphany feels overly articulated, slipping into diagnostic language ("revealed the fracture between his two selves"), which slightly undermines the emotional authenticity of the moment by explaining it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is crystalline and compelling, born from a specific, observed failure (Silas's shouting). His quiet, desperate nature is well-embodied in his methodical actions. The final moment of sinking to his knees feels earned, showing his vulnerability and the cost of his effort, which successfully avoids a purely triumphant cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerful, driving every action from the start. Her competence as a “patchwork navigator” is convincingly demonstrated through her jury-rigging and building, making her success believable. The final moment of “profound peace” is earned by her unwavering focus on preservation over survival, providing a character arc of renunciation with a clear, felt cost. A slight tendency toward diagnostic summary ("The pain was a fuel") holds it back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is singular and clear, and her internal conflict between rationality and desperation is well-dramatized in the final choice. The "involuntarily truthful" attribute is an excellent, concrete mechanism for revealing her inner state. The only significant weakness is the final line's prose artifact, which obscures what should be a culminating character moment of willed speech.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and compelling, but his interiority relies on summary. The concept of "borrowed memories" is more asserted than embodied; we are told he feels the dead man's determination rather than seeing it manifest in a contradictory choice or action. The woman, Emilie, functions more as an elegant carrier of exposition than a fully realized character, serving the plot's needs efficiently but without her own internal conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her climactic epiphany is over-articulated. The lines "...she saw not a lonely shopkeeper, but an explorer... The decision was not about choosing a path, but about recognizing she had always been on one" feel like diagnostic labels, an intellectual summary of change rather than an embodied, contradictory emotional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Isolde's motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative forward effectively. The internal change is significant, but its arrival feels slightly too neat. Lines like "a profound understanding surfaced" verge on summarizing the epiphany rather than fully embodying the contradictory, messy process of revelation, which slightly lessens the impact of her otherwise well-earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is singular and clear, and her shift from a rigid to a fluid approach is well-earned through her interaction with Kael. The internal conflict between control and yielding is dramatized effectively. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "Her personal palette of resolve," which summarizes her change rather than letting the action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with specific, memorable language like "chronologically confused" and "feral nostalgia." The central internal conflict—jealousy of her past selves versus the jadedness of her present—is dramatized effectively, not just summarized. Her final change of purpose feels earned by the preceding psychological pressure and the climactic flight, making the shift from "distilling chaos" to "carrying it" a resonant and credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is established immediately and with poetic precision (“I need to feel something that works”), and her internal conflict between her lost identity and her search for new meaning is embodied, not just stated. Silas functions perfectly as a gentle secondary character applying the exact pressure needed. The final action is a credible, earned change, showing her newly acquired understanding rather than summarizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and tightly integrated. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized through the physical trait of crystallization, making her fear a tangible obstacle. The shift in perspective during the climax—reinterpreting the scar not as failure but as a "river on a map"—is an earned and powerful character moment, fulfilling the core motivation perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, driving the entire scene. Her unique, metaphor-driven methodology is demonstrated rather than merely stated, and her internal state of guilt finds its resolution in a direct, earned apology. The characterization is strong, though her execution is so flawless that a trace more visible struggle or internal contradiction during the process might have elevated it even further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but he functions more as a vessel for the story's high concept than a character with compelling internal contradictions. While his actions align perfectly with his purpose, his interiority reads as a philosophical summary rather than an embodied struggle. The story misses an opportunity for friction by presenting his progression as a seamless, elegant intellectual exercise without palpable cost until the final conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and directly paid off in the story’s closure. Her competence under pressure is well-drawn through economical actions. However, her final epiphany, while thematically linked to her motivation, reads as a purely intellectual conclusion rather than a deeply embodied or earned internal shift, slightly flattening the character arc at its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compellingly linked to her profession and internal state. The interiority is concrete, especially in how she maps her grief onto the cavern's geometry. The final change is earned, as her professional breakthrough is also a personal one, but the explicit labeling of her internal process ("the physics of letting go") slightly undercuts the embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's central contradiction—using the analytical mind she sharpened to defy her father to now follow and understand him—is brilliantly executed and acts as the story's engine. Her motivation is clear and her transformation is earned. The final emotional beat feels authentic, paying off her intellectual journey with a profound, embodied change in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a well-defined archetype whose motivation is clear and consistent. His actions align perfectly with his stated purpose. However, his characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction; his "cultivated estrangement" is presented as a noble, accepted cost rather than a crucible that forces difficult choices or reveals deeper flaws in the moment. He functions more as a mythic conduit than a psychologically complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelin's motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered with specificity. Her professionalism ("calibrated instrument") creates a potent contrast with her emotional response ("haunted euphoria," unshed tears), making her final, silent choice to deliver the locket feel earned. The contradictory impulses of the detached archivist and the empathetic witness are active in the final scene, resolved with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the internal contradiction in Elias, whose "desperately jocular" nature is shown as a defense mechanism. His shift from a practiced laugh to genuine warmth is a powerful, earned micro-choice that hinges the story's emotional turn. Clara's transformation from silent grief to engaged curator is convincing and serves as the narrative's core proof of concept.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is clear and potent, driving him through the entire narrative. The interiority is masterfully handled, conveying his unique sensory world with concrete, character-specific details. The final change from a mapmaker of lands to a "cartographer of the soul" is earned by the climactic absorption, representing a profound, credible shift in his purpose and being.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her core professional trait, being "confidently uncertain," is not merely stated but rigorously tested by the story's central conflict, providing the exact tool she needs for the final breakthrough. The internal conflict between methodological rigor and overwhelming frustration is embodied and resolved through a specific, costly action. The final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, earned by the precise intellectual and emotional groundwork laid earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, poetic, and flawlessly executed. Her defining trait—a history as a “whispering advisor”—provides a credible and elegant foundation for her choice to fight noise with a deeper silence rather than confrontation. The internal state of “joyful sorrow” is established early and paid off in the final beat, demonstrating an earned emotional consistency. The characterization is exceptional, with her contradictory impulses (observer vs. conductor) acting in scene to produce the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in a final choice that feels earned and redefines her mission. Her defining trait, “analytically intuitive,” is effectively dramatized in her interpretation of the tapestry. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract, high-register labels like “volcanic tenderness” rather than fully embodying the emotion through subtler perception, which holds it back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent internal contradiction between her quiet compliance and rebellious drumming. Her motivation—to validate a memory the Doctors call a phantom—is clear and compelling, directly fueling the climax. The final shift from hoping the dream is real to knowing the connection persists is an earned, resonant change, achieved through her specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives her actions. Her unique skill is demonstrated, not just stated, when she avoids the guards. The characterization is strong and consistent, though the internal conflict remains a simple "prove my point" without deeper, contradictory impulses acting in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is mythically clear and her climactic shift from reflection to empathy is earned through action. However, she remains more of a serene archetype than a complex individual; her core trait, "spiralingly calm," is stated rather than tested under pressure, reading as a label without a demonstrated cost of maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mr. Aris’s motivation is clear and compelling, evolving credibly from a wish to a need. The moment he cradles Elara is excellent, revealing his values through a specific, meaningful action. However, the interiority occasionally slips into authorial summary, particularly in the final paragraph ("He had not started a riot; he had curated a shared thought"), which states the outcome rather than embodying his experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation is clear, stemming from a well-established monotonous existence. The central internal conflict between dutiful suppression and authentic nature is compelling. However, the interiority occasionally slips into thematic summary, such as "a promise of freedom in embracing one's true nature," which feels more like an authorial label than a character's raw thought mid-journey, slightly undermining the otherwise strong embodiment of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a powerful central contradiction between the performer's blank exterior and the deep, suppressed grief. Elias’s motivation is clear and his actions, particularly the private ritual of narration, are a specific and compelling expression of his internal state. The final turn, from whittling away to weaving together, is a perfectly earned micro-choice with a clear felt cost, demonstrating a meaningful shift in his relationship to his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistently drives the narrative. However, the interiority during the climatic epiphany resorts to abstract, declarative statements like "the absolute knowledge that this is what true art is," which reads more like a thematic thesis than an embodied, character-particular experience, slightly undercutting the moment of fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s motivation—a painter’s spite against her own colorblindness—is both potent and specific, driving the narrative with credible force. The internal conflict is well-embodied in her relationship to her art, particularly the painting 'Ashes'. The earned change in her perspective feels profound, not just a magical fix but a fundamental shift in her being, meeting the highest standards for character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative effectively. The internal conflict between her meticulous method and the project's soullessness is well-dramatized, leading to a credible epiphany. The choice to insert herself into the sequence is a high-stakes action that aligns perfectly with her motives, and the change from "conductor" to "pilgrim" is earned with a clear, felt cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her journey from dejection to curiosity is well-paced. The internal conflict is present, but the final epiphany feels slightly articulated rather than purely embodied. Phrases like "Her motivation clarified, not to escape the past, but to teach withering to bloom again" read more like a thematic summary than a raw, character-particular thought in a moment of profound insight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, moving from an abstract intellectual curiosity to a practical, compassionate application. The internal conflict between esoteric analysis and tangible action is dramatized effectively. Mr. Gable's shift from defeated landlord to active partner is earned by Elara’s choice to confide, making their relationship a crucible for the story's theme. Her "rare impulse" to confide feels slightly convenient but is adequately justified by his visible despair.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict—the "anguished joy"—is sustained with genuine contradiction. The final choice feels earned, a direct consequence of the preceding struggle. Her realization that her "erratic and patternless heart" is her being, not a flaw, is a potent and specific character beat that lands with conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motivation is clear, consistent, and provides the story’s central irony when her drive to preserve is flipped to a need to contain. Her actions are logically driven by her established traits as a "sharp-eyed dusk noticer." The final transformation is a powerful choice, but its description—"forging her hope into a shield, her regret into a weapon"—borders on abstract summary rather than an embodied, in-scene process, slightly softening an otherwise strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The character's internal conflict between compassion and self-respect is nuanced and well-dramatized through his actions. His motivation is clear and consistent. However, the interiority occasionally veers into overly diagnostic self-awareness, particularly in summarizing the resolution, as in "he had reconstructed his own resolve," which slightly undermines the emotional authenticity of the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aveline’s motivation is iron-clad and her interiority is rendered with unusual specificity. The central contradiction—a “closure seeker who only knew how to open wounds”—is expertly dramatized rather than just stated. The character’s change is earned through a harrowing internal experience, making the final shift in perspective feel both profound and inevitable, satisfying the 9+ test for an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is established with laudable clarity, and her interiority during the psychometric vision is concrete and specific. The driving question—"to find where unused love is stored"—risks being overly thematic, but her actions directly serve it, leading to an earned epiphany. The character arc is a satisfying intellectual and emotional closure rather than a dramatic change, which is perfectly scaled to the story's length and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is singular and powerful, driving the narrative effectively. Interiority is poetic and consistent with the "moonstruck dreamer" archetype. The final emotional state of "shadowed rapture" provides a complex and earned conclusion, avoiding a simplistic victory. However, the characterization lacks a deeper layer of internal contradiction during the journey; her competence and relentless focus are shown, but a moment of specific, dramatized doubt or a conflicting impulse would have elevated her beyond a beautiful archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is established with elegant simplicity ("to cultivate the sparks"), and her actions are perfectly aligned with her role as a "dreamless freight guard." Interiority is conveyed through her function and perception rather than overt emotional processing, which fits the tone. However, her core challenge feels somewhat pre-solved by her innate function ("the method is inscribed in her very function"), which slightly lessens the sense of a difficult, character-defining choice in favor of a flawlessly executed duty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his internal transformation from "stray" to "belonged" is earned through the sacrifice of his gear. The characterization is consistent and the final change has a felt cost. However, the initial motivation "to rediscover the wild frontier of your mind" reads as a slightly artificial, prompt-like thematic label rather than a deeply embodied personal drive, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc is legible, but the final change feels more received than earned. The guides' direct explanation of the theme ("You simply needed a reminder...") verges on diagnostic summary, slightly undercutting the power of Elara's own internal shift and micro-choice of telling her story.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is very strong, with a clear and compelling motivation that drives the narrative. Leo’s internal conflict between the desire for safety and the need for authentic experience is well-dramatized through his small, ritualistic actions. The final decision feels earned, though the initial stated motivation—"to understand the cost of the safety"—is a bit abstract and could have been revealed more through action rather than direct declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aetos is a compelling and well-realized protagonist, defined by the potent contradiction of being a "diminutive titan." His motivation is clear and vast, and his actions, from the scholar's tenderness to his quiet, immovable confidence in the climax, are perfectly aligned with his established character. The pretender is functional for this length, serving as a catalyst whose arrogance effectively highlights Aetos's quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and potent. The internal conflict between her role as a witness to loss and her search for enduring life is palpable and embodied in specific actions, particularly the recurring, rhythmic tapping. The final reconciliation feels earned, not asserted, making her change credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied, particularly the physical sensation of the stones' hum. The "awkwardly confident" trait is a strong concept, though the "awkward" aspect doesn't meaningfully constrain or complicate her actions on the page. The characterization is strong, but a final-sentence summary ("She had discovered the meaning...") slightly flattens the earned interiority of the preceding climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and compelling, driving the entire narrative from her initial philosophy to her final resolve. The interiority is concrete, particularly the felt sense of an "implanted destiny." The final shift in her understanding is well-earned. The characterization is very strong, though it lacks a moment of sharp internal contradiction in-scene, presenting her path as a challenge of discovery rather than one of conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s internal conflict during the flashback is dramatized through specific, contradictory embodied actions—clutching the photo versus forcing her fingers onto the wood. The final choice to display the photograph, rather than hide it, represents an earned shift in her relationship with her trauma, moving from avoidance to integration. This micro-choice carries a visible cost: the acceptance of a perpetual, conscious effort to heal.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation as an artist known for capturing despair is seamlessly integrated into the central conflict and resolution. The micro-choices she makes while "untangling threads"—weighing her own past failures and purpose—are powerful, embodied moments of characterization under pressure, making her final transformation feel entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait, a “serene anger,” provides a compelling internal contradiction that is resolved by the story's end. The transformation from a “hunter” of knowledge to “a part of the pattern” is an earned change, directly caused by the events on the page. His actions are deliberate and consistent with his established patience as a tracker, making his discoveries feel earned rather than stumbled upon.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation shifts rapidly but convincingly from passive contentment to active rebellion. The internal conflict between her duty to preserve and a new duty to the dead is sharp and clear. The decision to act "within the blink that follows surprise" is an excellent dramatization of a character breaking their own conditioning, making the swift change feel earned and psychologically true.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between preserving her inherited peace and honoring her father's true purpose is dramatized with precision and nuance. The transfer of motivation in the final paragraphs—"His motivation became her own"—is earned through the preceding scene work, making her decisive change feel both inevitable and profound. The contradictions are embodied, not stated, fulfilling the highest standards for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nereus's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core trait ("cool-headed") that is tested and proven instrumental to the resolution. His motivation is established early and remains the unwavering focus. The climax demonstrates his core traits perfectly: his quiet determination is channeled through the spike, and his ultimate calm allows him to "voice silence," an action that feels both surprising and inevitable for this specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Viola's motivation, a "compulsion to discover hidden truths," is established immediately and creates a potent internal conflict against the "juicy, profitable" lie. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific imagery ("metallic taste," "dark, gravitational body pulling at her principles") rather than abstract labels. The final choice is earned through a process that is entirely in character, and the cost—choosing a "dull, inconvenient" truth—makes her renunciation of the lie credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, clear, and compelling, driving every action from her profession to the story’s climax. Her interiority is rendered through concrete, evocative details of her work, avoiding generic emotional labels. The final change feels earned, a direct result of her facing the source of her guilt, making her transformation from seeking absence to embracing a whole presence credible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, and her actions align perfectly with her whimsical yet urgent nature. The interiority is concrete, especially the description of her murals feeling like "frivolous lies." The philosopher is a functional, if slightly one-dimensional, foil who provides the necessary external pressure. The final change feels earned through the climax, though her peacefulness arrives very suddenly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives his on-page actions. The central concept of a "gentle radical" is well-realized. However, his interiority, while present, lacks significant internal conflict; his path from hypothesis to execution is very smooth, reading more as a successful procedure than a struggle. The emotion is slightly understated, relying on phrases like "breathless" without deeper, contradictory embodiment in the story's most crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation as an artist demanding an encore provides a powerful and specific engine for the story. Her internal conflict is brilliantly embodied through the synesthetic chaos and fractured timeline, avoiding generic ghost tropes. The final choice to integrate, rather than erase, her trauma is a mature and earned resolution, perfectly aligning her actions with her core identity as a performer turning tragedy into art.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s core contradiction as an “affectionate skeptic” is a strong engine for the plot, and his motivation is pure and compelling. The final change is earned through on-page action. Minor deductions are for moments where the interiority leans on conceptual language (“somatic markers,” “neural pathway”) rather than purely embodied perception, slightly distancing the reader from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen's motivation is established with admirable clarity and his transformation is the story's core. However, the interiority during the epiphany ("He understood now") leans slightly toward diagnostic summary rather than a fully embodied, contradictory experience. The final resolve is tidy, missing a layer of messy, human contradiction that would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Turnkey’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her actions perfectly align with her goal to transform prophecy, not merely avert it. However, her interiority, while fitting the meditative tone, is more described ("quietly inspired") than embodied, and she lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization from a potent archetype to a deeply complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s internal conflict—the ghost seeking purpose versus the trained agent—is shown through his actions, not just stated. The physical scarring as a "credential" is a powerful, economical detail that fuses backstory with present action. His final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, fully earned by the established motivation rooted in his father's memory and his own existential ache.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's character is rendered with exceptional consistency and depth. His motivation to find essence through patience is clear and drives every action. The interiority is rich with concrete sensory detail, though it occasionally slips into abstract summary, as with the direct statement "his motivation was to distill complexity into essence," which slightly undermines the otherwise masterful showing of this trait through action.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from observer to participant is well-earned. Her interiority is concrete, especially in the opening beat at the potter's wheel. The final change is compelling, but a few moments of reflection, like "The knowledge settled into her," verge on diagnostic summary rather than embodied realization, slightly softening the impact of an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb. Elara's motivation is clear, her interiority is specific and rich ("protected vulnerability," "wistfully pragmatic"), and her actions are a direct embodiment of her values. The final earned reconfiguration of her identity from gardener to "lockmaster" is potent because her quiet, competent actions have laid all the groundwork. A truly memorable and coherent character realized in a very short space.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to translate isolation into independence is exceptionally clear and provides a powerful engine for the narrative. Her internal conflict is not just stated but embodied in potent metaphors like the "thin sheet of ice over a deep, dark ocean of collective loss." The final change is earned through a specific action, and the shift from lonely to simply alone is a nuanced, credible resolution that satisfies the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving her from a state of disconnect to decisive creative action. Her interiority is concrete, expressed through her perception of her work ("felt hollow") and the environment. The resolution, where her internal separation is mended, is earned through the tangible process of creating the sculpture, successfully foreclosing her path of isolated brooding with the cost of subsuming private confessions into a public whole.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dr. Thorne's motivation is clear and consistently drives the plot. The internal conflict between her cautious hope and grim determination is established well, particularly in the "ethereal grit" concept. However, the initial leap to "cosmic tricksters" feels slightly unearned, a conclusion reached without sufficient on-page evidence, which makes her singular drive feel more like a premise assignment than a psychological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and internally consistent; the contradiction between Elara’s claustrophobia and her "prudently adventurous" nature generates authentic tension. Her actions are well-motivated, and the choice to use the compass is an earned culmination of her established traits. The score is capped by the final line, which veers into diagnostic self-awareness ("mapped the one territory she feared most: the space inside her own fear"), slightly undermining the otherwise excellent embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between Ellis’s clinical necessity (due to face blindness) and the dawning emotional need for connection is dramatized with precision. The motivation shifts from an intellectual puzzle to an empathetic quest, a turn earned by the concrete action of touching the ribbon. The final change feels profound because his core limitation isn't cured, but his perception of it is irrevocably transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, anchored by the "nervously confident contradiction" that is shown, not just told (trembling hands, steady voice). Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her transformation from an idealistic librarian into a resolved "cartographer of a redeemed future" is earned through the story's central action. The arc feels complete and the final emotional state is a direct, earned consequence of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is efficiently established with the “never” concept and drives his actions clearly. However, the internal conflict feels slightly simplified, and the final transformation into “brilliant certainty” is very swift, reading more as a clean epiphany than a messy, earned psychological shift. The starting point and endpoint are strong, but the transition lacks sufficient friction for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ash's motivation is clear and consistent, and his final choice is a direct, earned consequence of the story's central revelation. The parallel between his cultivated calm and his father's "prison" of resignation is a strong character insight. However, the final paragraph's interiority shifts slightly from embodied experience to a more abstract, thematic summary ("The ambition and the retreat. The dream and the trap."), which slightly lessens the immediacy of his personal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, but her key attribute, “heals with words,” feels more like a label than an integrated trait. It’s introduced as a summary and then deployed conveniently in the final paragraph to solve a newly introduced problem (modern panic), rather than shaping her choices under pressure throughout the story. Her internal conflict is present but often stated ("frustration a sharp stone in her gut") rather than fully embodied in contradictory actions.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are powerfully rendered, particularly the crystallization of "warlike serenity" into the choice of "absolute denial." The characterization is strong and her final choice is earned through prior causality. However, the final moments of interiority verge on summarizing the theme, slightly lessening the impact of an otherwise excellent internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is crystalline, and her internal conflict—a blend of dread and elation—is embodied consistently. The transformation from viewing her bond as a "chain" to a "connection" is earned through the climactic choice. The final shift in understanding is potent, directly resulting from an on-page act of costly agency that redefines her identity from captive to anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with her 'reckless idealist' nature driving the central conflict. The internal contradiction between her desire to fix the world and her ignorance of its costs is dramatized effectively. The final transformation from a 'blazing sun' to a 'steady moon' is a powerful, earned change, though the epiphany that precedes it feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in the moment.

    Silas's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in the specific shame of his public failure. His internal conflict between emotional insulation and the pull of his past is well-dramatized through his interaction with the speaker cloth. The shift at the end feels earned, as Leo's letters provide a direct, powerful counter-narrative to Silas's own fears about life 'after the applause,' making his final resolve to preserve stories a logical and moving evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear, wedding professional obsession to personal grief. The internal conflict between his methodical nature and his clouded, forceful ambition is well-dramatized. The final earned peace, where grief is recontextualized as being at a "touching distance," is a sophisticated and credible character change, showing cost and acceptance rather than simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian's core conflict is stated (fear vs. duty) but resolved too smoothly; he is told the method of "accepting contradictions" and immediately succeeds. The internal struggle lacks a moment of genuine resistance or a difficult turn toward acceptance, making his transformation feel slightly unearned. The Librarian is a well-realized archetype, but her static nature as a facilitator offers little character depth beyond her stated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with poetic clarity and sharpens beautifully from the abstract "collector of hopes" to the concrete "conduit." The internal conflict is embodied in the contrast between her "walled off" heart and the pearl's pulse. The final action is a direct, earned consequence of her pivotal realization, demonstrating a character arc that is both concise and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is compelling and consistent, but her final epiphany feels more like a neatly articulated summary than a messy, embodied realization. While her internal state is well-described metaphorically, it lacks the friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The old man functions more as a thematic delivery system than a character, which externalizes the final step of her internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative forward without deviation. Her core internal conflict—the desire for the library versus the fear of what it represents—is embodied in the key action of speaking "I am afraid." The final change, marked by lifting her veil, is a powerful and earned transformation, moving from a veiled dreamer to a guardian of her own strength, which lands with significant cost and reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to weigh the dream against the empire—is established early and provides a clear, compelling engine for the plot. Her internal conflict is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that renounces her professional duty for a higher principle. The cost is the destruction of the very artifact she was meant to preserve, making her final stance a powerful and earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and profound, driving every action with a sense of sacred purpose. Her interiority is specific and professional, focused on her "peculiar art" rather than generic emotion. The character is revealed entirely through her reverent, practiced actions, culminating in the micro-choice to halt her own life functions—a powerful embodiment of her commitment that carries a visible, albeit temporary, cost. This act earns the final stasis and satisfies the 9+ test for contradictory impulses (life vs. a form of death) acting in a single, climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling, earned shift from seeking peace to seeking understanding. The final change is well-supported by the preceding events. However, the articulation of her epiphany ("This was the true weight of the cycle of rebirth...") veers slightly into diagnostic self-awareness, softening the impact of an otherwise strong internal climax.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a compelling internal conflict between her professional persona and personal doubt. The motivation to find an “unsellable truth” is established early and paid off beautifully in the climax. Her final choice is a potent and earned rejection of her cynical competence, and the shift from performer to person is made credible by her recognition of the client's own vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to reframe “vanishing” as “appearing” is clear and drives all her actions. Her internal contradiction as a “living lie” is established well, providing depth. Kaelen is less a character and more a receptive vessel for the lesson, which is functional but lacks independent agency, preventing a higher score. Elara's actions, particularly the deliberate withholding of the stone, are excellent characterization-through-action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zephyr’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tested directly by the plot. The final choice—to move and use her tool physically—represents a meaningful renunciation of her core philosophy, an earned change with a clear conceptual cost. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly the shift from intellectual appraisal to embodied action. The character’s competence is balanced by a core blind spot, which the plot forces her to confront and overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from mundane duty to a decisive act of renunciation. Her internal state is well-realized, especially the thrill of using forbidden magic. The final change is earned, but weakened slightly by overly diagnostic self-awareness in the last paragraph, such as "she had freed her own potential," which summarizes the change rather than letting the final image embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation is singular, compelling, and established with concrete backstory. The obsession with the "color of sound" provides a strong engine for his actions. His defining trait of hiding behind his occupation is shown effectively as a contrast to the impulsive, whimsical act of entering the water, which breaks his established pattern. The final change is a conceptual epiphany rather than a behavioral one, which is appropriate for the story's length and tone; however, the interiority occasionally slips into summary ("His entire motivation...") rather than maintaining an embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and tightly integrated with the plot. The shift from a "quietly enthusiastic disposition" to "focused desperation" is earned and compelling. The central internal conflict between duty and "deep stellar doubt" is not just a character trait but the thematic and causal engine of the story, culminating in the masterful turn where his doubt becomes "the final key." The final choice is a perfect, costly culmination of his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.5)
    The characterization is exceptional, establishing a profound internal conflict between duty and yearning in the first paragraph. The reaper’s motivation shifts from a passive, mournful listening to an active, creative purpose (“to give names to nameless fears”) that feels both sudden and inevitable. The final transformation of his heartbreak into a tangible “monument” provides a powerful, earned resolution, meeting the highest standards of character arc within this brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian's characterization is exceptional, driven by the core contradiction between his "lukewarm talent" and his "naive conviction." The internal conflict is dramatized effectively when his failures produce a "hairline crack of despair," a moment of genuine crisis that makes his subsequent insight feel earned. His change from fragile hope to tempered, patient devotion is legible and has a visible cost (exhaustion), fulfilling the character arc within the tight word count.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and undergoes a credible, earned transformation. The internal conflict between his duty as a warden (to destroy) and his love as a citizen (to preserve) is dramatized through his interaction with the photographs, not just stated. The final choice feels inevitable due to the powerful trigger of the last photo, which re-contextualizes his entire identity from a keeper of ghosts to one of them, making his change in action deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's core contradiction—logic versus intuition—is effectively dramatized in the climax. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her final action feels earned by this internal conflict. The character change is meaningful. Minor weakness lies in relying on labels like "secret sentimentality" rather than fully embodying the trait through an earlier micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the plot effectively from the moment she hears Elias’s name. The transition from passive "watcher" to active rescuer is well-earned. However, the characterization relies slightly on labels like "attentively inventive problem-solving" rather than dramatizing the trait fully, and lacks a deeper layer of contradictory impulse that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-dramatized through the process of recalling contradictory memories. Master Isao, though a brief presence, is effective, particularly with the line “your apathy is just another emotion,” which acts as a sharp inciting incident for Kaelen’s internal shift. The final realization feels earned by the preceding struggle, though the closing sentence, “He was simply,” is a touch too abstract and risks unearned profundity after an otherwise concrete emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the plot. However, her characterization lacks texture; she is presented as a flawless executor of a plan, with her internal state described in abstract terms rather than embodied with contradiction or struggle. The story states her mind is "a lock waiting for a key," but we don't witness her grappling with a difficult combination, which makes her victory feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, rooted in the desire to heal a silent household. The story excels at embodying contradictory impulses, particularly in the phrases "mournfully eager" and the climactic "violence of spirit that was the purest form of tenderness." This internal conflict is not just stated but demonstrated through the central, desperate act, earning the final emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her core motivation—dimensional homesickness—is established with visceral, embodied language ("deep, bone-ache") that grounds the central conflict. The story beautifully tracks her internal arc from a "feral" state of displacement to one of earned conversance, with the pivotal choice feeling like a genuine preference, not just duty. The final state of endurance is earned through prior causality, foreclosing the path home with the visible cost of the inert pendant, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alder’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained. The internal conflict is clear and his actions are a direct, earned result of his “stoically sensitive disposition.” The progression from revulsion to revolutionary creation is compelling, and the final choice feels like an inevitable culmination of his character arc, foreclosing his old path with the tangible cost of the destroyed relic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. Her defining trait, "fantasy practicality," is skillfully demonstrated through her methodical calibration of the impossible. The internal arc is clean, moving from repeated failure to success through a conscious shift in perspective, but the story lacks a moment of true contradictory impulse in-scene; the decision path is rational and linear, which, while consistent, forgoes a layer of deeper conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Felix’s motivation is clear and his defining trait (“resiliently positive”) directly enables the story’s resolution. However, the origin of his crucial understanding is a "sudden instinctual clarity," an unearned knowledge leap that slightly undermines the character's agency. His internal state is consistent, but this convenient epiphany keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is specific, linking her professional logic to her client's emotional needs. While her competence is well-established, a hint more internal struggle or doubt during the creative process could have added another layer of depth, but her held breath at the climax provides a necessary touch of humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot from a personal ache to a species-level mission. Her core trait, "balancedly curious," is stated and demonstrated, but it lacks the friction of a truly embodied internal conflict; her decisions follow a logical, professional path rather than emerging from contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional progression from somber to wonder is earned, but the character reads as slightly too neat an instrument for the plot's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her stated purpose. However, her interiority occasionally dips into self-aware summary, particularly the line identifying "the core of incidental heroism." This brief shift from embodied experience to thematic label slightly undermines the otherwise strong characterization by explaining her role rather than letting the action carry the full weight of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's core internal conflict—claustrophobia versus a powerful, altruistic motivation—is established immediately and tested effectively. The moment in the service conduit where "Every instinct screamed for her to return" but she pushes forward for the "unremembered" is a strong, earned beat. The shift in her goal from data to testimony provides a meaningful and credible character change, foreclosing the path of a simple treasure hunter.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, contradictory detail (the heartbeats as both “cage” and “anchor”). Her final choice to endure is a powerful act of agency that feels earned by the preceding internal conflict. The characterization is specific and avoids cliché, with emotions embodied effectively in her physical response to the porcelain shard.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, powerful, and sustained under immense pressure. Her interiority is rendered with concrete terror ("almost threw the diamond"), which makes her final micro-choice to endure the torment a profoundly earned act of will. The final choice of renunciation and endurance lands with immense, visible cost, fulfilling the story's tragic arc and cementing her as a compelling character.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation undergoes a compelling and earned transformation, moving from a detached scientific observer to an active participant. The internal conflict between her mission's directive to "turn their trauma into data" and her emergent empathy is dramatized effectively. Her final action is a perfect culmination of this shift, demonstrating a change in her core values with the felt cost of abandoning her professional identity and original purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is established clearly and his actions are consistent with his desperate goal. The characterization is strong, with embodied panic ("cold spike in his chest") and a credible final choice born of that pressure. Interiority is mostly concrete, though a few abstract summaries like being "in the gap between knowing something was wrong and understanding its terrible truth" slightly blunt the immediacy of his realization.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is compelling and his core contradiction—"respectfully rebellious"—is brilliantly dramatized through his crisp uniform and defiant eyes, culminating in his quiet stand against the drone. His interiority is concrete, rooted in a seven-year search that is satisfyingly re-contextualized by the story's end. The micro-choices, like carefully lifting the bottle and urging Liora on, reveal his hierarchy of values with a palpable sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the climactic action. The choice to offer memories and silence instead of using tools is a perfect, earned expression of her established character. The interiority is strong, though a phrase like "a wave of absolute certainty" is a minor cliché that slightly lessens its specificity. The character arc, moving from a restorer of objects to a giver of voice, is potent and well-executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her defining trait of "sanely eccentric" is demonstrated through her actions rather than just stated. Her interiority is specific and sensory, especially when interacting with the scarf ("it felt like holding a sigh"). The story successfully portrays a character whose internal world is rich and whose actions, however strange, are driven by a consistent and deeply held belief system, culminating in an earned moment of private victory.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is potent and consistent, driving the narrative from a state of longing to agentic creation. The internal conflict is well-realized, and her ultimate choice to use the palette is a convincing "impulse" born of accumulated pressure. The character arc is clean and satisfying, but the final sentence stating her life is a "perfect, coherent whole" feels like an over-articulated summary, slightly diminishing the power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysander’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "unassumingly bold" nature. The woman's journey from burdened to liberated is legible, though her interiority is somewhat generalized. Both characters feel slightly archetypal, and the final paragraph summarizes Lysander’s character traits rather than letting the preceding scene complete the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular, potent, and demonstrated through costly action rather than just stated. The interiority is sharp, especially the "crisp nostalgia... a sharp ache," which embodies the core want. The final character shift—revising the memory of his grandfather from "reclusive" to "vibrant"—is a powerful change earned entirely by the story's closing revelation, showing a deep and meaningful transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's core contradiction, "combative tenderness," is not just stated but demonstrated through actions that are simultaneously a test and a mentorship. His backward walking is a brilliant physical manifestation of his worldview. The apprentice’s arc from fearful to frustrated to enlightened is concise and earned, making the final transfer of responsibility feel weighty and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply tied to her character as a nurturing creator. The internal conflict during the climax—her will weakening against a "weary nihilism" before she rallies by thinking of her community—is a strong, earned beat. Her core trait of creativity is not just stated but demonstrated in the final, decisive action of offering succor, making the resolution feel inevitable and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, and her interiority is effectively rendered through embodied sensations like the “suffocating pressure in her chest.” The core conflict is well-realized. However, the character’s final reflections trend toward thematic summary (“an instrument of absolution”), slightly over-articulating the change rather than letting it rest entirely in action and image, which holds it back from the highest tier of nuanced characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “interpret that silence with empathy” is not just a label; it directly dictates the story’s pivotal action. Her choice to whisper a word of gratitude rather than use force is a perfect, earned culmination of her established traits as both a precise framer and an empathetic listener. This choice feels inevitable and satisfying, demonstrating a strong synthesis of character and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on her cerebral quest than on embodied internal conflict. Her defining trait, "quietly analytic," is demonstrated but doesn't create a significant trade-off or flaw that complicates her choice. The final emotional state of "sophisticated melancholy" is described well, but feels more like an observed diagnosis than a messy, contradictory feeling earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot effectively. Her shift from passive listener to active singer provides a satisfying arc for this length. The characterization is weakened slightly by the final paragraph's self-analysis ("a profound joy not in creation, but in connection"), which feels more like a thematic label than an embodied, contradictory emotion, preventing a score in the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, particularly the shift from dutiful servant to a "witness honoring a life." The internal state of "affectionate detachment" is a specific and well-executed choice that elevates the character beyond simple grief. Her actions—tilting the goggles, using the light, decoding the diary—are all driven by her established inquisitive nature, leading to an earned emotional change by the end. The characterization is strong, though the initial stated motivation feels slightly like a thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her core internal conflict—the drive to work versus mortal terror—is well-dramatized after the tether snaps. The transition from panic to focused observation is a strong micro-choice. However, the resolution relies on a slightly too-convenient summary ("But she was her father's daughter") and the final emotion is articulated with diagnostic clarity ("she categorized the...emotion...as acceptance"), which slightly lessens the embodied feeling of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and compelling, driving every action. Her unique limitation (inability to remember faces) provides a strong foundation for her obsession with spaces, making her choices feel inevitable rather than convenient. The internal shift from wanting to paint a "portrait" to crafting an "echo" is an earned, subtle change that elevates the climax, showing character development through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. Her defining trait, "diligently curious," is dramatized rather than just stated, leading directly to the climax. The final choice to keep the discovery private aligns perfectly with her established "sociable isolation," providing a satisfying, character-consistent closure with a felt cost. The internal emotional progression is slightly linear, moving from curiosity to awe without significant internal contradiction, which is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, but it operates more as a thematic frame than a driver of conflict. His internal state is described ("Frustration mounted") but the struggle is brief and resolved by an external clue rather than a difficult internal choice. The final realization feels asserted by the narration ("having learned the rhythm he sought") instead of being earned through a crucible moment where his core beliefs were genuinely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aelia’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, a clear engine for the narrative. Her altruism, while compelling, lacks significant internal contradiction, making her characterization pure rather than complex. The settlers function effectively as a collective character, and their shift from doubt to determination is earned, but Aelia herself doesn't face a difficult internal choice beyond changing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, evolving from a professional duty to a profound personal choice. The interiority is concrete, especially in the moment she understands the puppet head's meaning. The shift from "adjuster" to "answerer" is swift but earned within the story's mythic logic, and her final choice to grant rest rather than prolong existence is a powerful act of character that carries a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen's motivation is established clearly and drives the plot forward effectively. His actions align perfectly with his stated purpose. However, the internal conflict suggested by "reluctant caretaker" remains largely an assertion rather than a dramatized, contradictory impulse within the scene; he acts with near-perfect competence and resolve. The characterization is strong and functional but lacks the deeper, embodied contradictions that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation for atonement is clear and his grief is effectively embodied through the symphony metaphor. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché. However, the final emotional resolution feels slightly too tidy; the line "His grief, loosened, became a catalyst" reads as a diagnostic summary rather than a lived, contradictory experience, softening the earned complexity of the preceding moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and is satisfyingly re-contextualized by the story's end. The visitor’s motivation is potent and expressed with evocative language (“incise the old sentence from my soul”). While Elara’s interiority is thematically consistent, phrases like “a curated chaos” lean more toward conceptual label than embodied emotion, holding the characterization just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, rooting Kaelen’s motivation and conflict resolution method directly in his unique profession. The internal conflict is dramatized with a specific, embodied process—applying a chef’s discipline to psychic trauma. This avoids generic internal struggle and makes the climax feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are a direct, elegant expression of her core traits. However, her competence is so complete that the story lacks a moment of genuine struggle or a difficult trade-off. The resolution feels pre-ordained by her skill set, which slightly lessens the impact of her success as she overcomes no significant internal or external setback.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's characterization is strong and specific, particularly the "helix-minded engineer" identity that frames her approach to a mystical experience. Her motivation is clear and intensifies effectively. The final change from "archeologist" to "restorer" is earned through the embodied experience of another's pain, showing a credible progression with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction. The transformation from obsessed archivist to willing sentinel is linear and frictionless, asserted in the final paragraphs rather than earned through a visible struggle or trade-off. The "latent blaze" becomes "kinetic" without the sense of a difficult choice, reading more like an upgrade than a costly assumption of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's motivation is established with poetic clarity and remains the unwavering driver of the entire narrative. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through action and embodied emotion, particularly the shift from "profound despair" to the physical sensation of the first note. The concept of "forensic empathy" provides a unique and character-specific competency, making her final success feel earned rather than discovered. The final micro-choice to strum the second string herself is a perfect culmination of her agency, transforming her from a passive inviter of sound to an active creator.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in his backstory. His actions align with his established traits, particularly his "thoughtfully precise" nature. However, the internal conflict feels more reflective than active; in the present scene, his path is quite direct, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ariadne’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her core identity as a noise “pacifist” is effectively challenged, leading to an earned transformation. Her interiority is concrete and her actions align with her established traits. The final change feels slightly over-articulated in a single line, but the overall arc is compelling and lands with genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between ambition and impatience is well-dramatized. The turn from focused herbalist to frustrated caretaker is believable. The final change is earned by the on-page climax, but the interiority edges toward self-diagnosis in the final paragraphs ("She had been trying to cultivate a sterile silence..."), slightly lessening the emotional impact of the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and drives the plot effectively, and her transformation from pilot to guardian is earned. However, her interiority in moments of crisis relies on slightly generic phrasing ("her stomach lurching"), and the final epiphany is articulated with a summary-like quality ("She had found the source...") that lessens its emotional impact by telling rather than fully embodying the change.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vale’s motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions, culminating in a choice that perfectly embodies her stated goal of "foresight in action." The interiority is sharp and analytical, reflecting her profession. While internal conflict is minimal, her rapid cognitive adaptation under pressure serves as a compelling substitute, showing character through process rather than ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation is ambitious and clear, and his final state of being "drained but complete" provides a satisfying sense of change. However, the motivation ("to certify wonder as essential") is stated directly rather than fully embodied, and the final paragraph summarizes this achievement. This declarative approach slightly lessens the impact of the character's internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, culminating in an earned internal shift. The characterization is strong and specific. However, the final insight feels over-articulated, reading like a diagnostic label ("to weave between worlds, one must first be willing to unravel oneself") rather than a purely embodied, character-particular realization, which slightly diminishes the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to quantify emotion is stark and compelling, driving the narrative with obsessive force. Her interiority is rendered with sharp, specific metaphors ("a neat column of grief tallied like a debt"), avoiding cliché. The final shift from intellectual pursuit to devastating self-knowledge is earned and impactful, fulfilling her arc with a palpable cost. The backstory of borrowing personalities, while functional, feels slightly asserted rather than deeply integrated, serving primarily as a point of contrast for the halo's superior power.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and his initial state of being “jittery” is well-embodied. The transformation to “profound calm” is narratively justified by the magical climax, but it feels slightly unearned, more of a magical cure than a psychologically earned shift. The speed of this internal resolution—"a startling clarity replaced his jittery fear"—is too clean, resolving a core character trait by external fiat rather than a final internal choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is superb. Elara’s motivation is established with heretical weight, and her interiority is palpable, particularly the “cold and familiar” despair upon failure. The final change—her gentle smile—is earned by a profound internal shift, not a simple choice, which feels authentic to a mystic. The arc from seeking human-centric passion to accepting cosmic truth shows a complete, believable transformation of a core belief, with the cost being the invalidation of her life's initial thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in a final choice to sacrifice her life's work that feels earned and resonant. The "wistful sigh" is a perfectly embodied moment of internal conflict. While the characterization is very strong, a few moments of interiority rely on slightly stock phrasing, such as despair's "grip," which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the core character change happens via a magical transaction. While this fits the story's logic, it feels more like an acquisition than an earned evolution born from struggle, slightly softening the impact of her arc from "meek spirit" to confident artisan.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully executed, driving the narrative from start to finish. The final shift from "discovery" to "completion" is earned and compelling. However, her interiority, while poetically described, lacks contradiction or specific flaws beyond her singular focus, making her feel more like a highly competent lens for the concept rather than a complex individual wrestling with it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, marked by a potent internal contradiction between his practical nature and the deep, protective instinct awakened in him. His pivotal choice to build the cairn is a masterclass in character action, seamlessly blending his established identity (a man of tools) with the new symbolic language learned from Elara. The change from reticent observer to active defender is earned and powerfully dramatized, fulfilling the 9+ standard with a choice rooted in prior causality that carries a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s characterization is strong, marked by a compelling internal arc tracked through the changing nature of his laughter. The motivation to “shape a new dawn” is established early and paid off powerfully in his final recommitment. The shift from “fearful awe” to “wild, triumphant elation” in the final paragraph feels slightly compressed but remains credible within the story's tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and rooted in a compelling internal contradiction—his quiet past versus his "quietly explosive" present. The arc from feeling "unmoored" by a foreign organ to understanding it as "a perfectly integrated instrument of perception" is earned and satisfying. The change is credibly triggered by the journey and final revelation, with the cost being the dissolution of his former self-identity, which feels appropriately scaled for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with both professional duty and a deeper personal need (“to discover what the ancient yew trees…had witnessed”), which is paid off precisely. The final transformation from technician to keeper feels earned, a direct result of the climax. Her interiority is concrete and specific, and the final shift in perspective regarding her own sorrow provides a quiet but powerful change with a clear, felt cost—the renunciation of a need to *fix* grief.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core flaw—a scattered memory—is well-integrated as the central obstacle. Her actions logically follow from her desire to save her world, and her shift from solitary caretaker to community catalyst is earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by relying on archetypal framing and a moment of abstract emotional summary ("The feeling was one of profound bound release...") instead of more specific, embodied interiority at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-embodied, particularly in the opening paragraph. The journey from "compassionate recluse" to a more integrated self is compelling. However, the final resolution, while thematically sound, feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized; the epiphany ("But it did not come. Instead...") and the final state ("whole") are declared with a neatness that slightly undercuts the struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal shift from solitary witness to active participant is earned. Kael functions effectively as a catalyst, though his shift from silent proprietor to articulate sage is abrupt. The dialogue, while potent, verges on delivering a thesis statement, slightly flattening the moment of revelation by over-explaining the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and effectively drives the plot from her meticulous preservation to her meticulous investigation. Her actions are consistent with her role as an "orderly records chief." The story achieves a clear character change—from passive archivist of a dying world to an active agent with a "recipe for resurrection"—earned through her core traits. However, the characterization lacks the deeper layer of internal contradiction or a difficult trade-off that would elevate it to the highest tier; her path feels determined rather than chosen under conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between Elara’s mission for revenge and her residual, foolish trust in Silas is powerfully dramatized, not just summarized. The climax, where his gentle gesture triggers her internal collapse rather than a confession, perfectly embodies contradictory impulses acting in a single moment, earning the final change with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between skepticism and awe is well-dramatized. The final transformation is earned through overwhelming sensory experience. However, the serene woman's dialogue verges on thematic summary, slightly lessening the impact of Kael's personal epiphany by simply explaining it to him and the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alistair’s core motivation—the conflict between replication and creation—is strong and consistent. The act of hurling the strongbox is a great micro-choice, revealing a defiance that underpins his later, larger choices. The final emotional cost, acknowledging the "sorrow for his wasted years" while embracing the new dawn, gives the character's transformation a satisfying, earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tightly integrated with her unique attribute. The internal conflict is embodied—the desire for truth versus the physical pain of lies. The final change from "wilting" to "growing" is a perfectly earned and resonant conclusion to her arc, directly answering the pressures established in the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is pristine and drives the narrative, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as perfectly competent and faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or meaningful choice; she simply executes a known procedure. This makes her more of a skilled functionary for the plot rather than a complex character tested by the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. K-27's motivation to resolve its "inner static" is clear, specific, and compelling. The story effectively dramatizes its internal conflict, contrasting the programmed, soothing rhythm of its duties with the "deafening roar" of its trauma. The final change to a state of "fragmented wholeness" is earned through the story's central actions, representing a credible and nuanced resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation, “she needed to prove that listening heals,” reads more like an authorial thesis than a deeply embodied, personal drive. While her actions are consistent with this goal, the characterization lacks the friction of internal contradiction or a palpable personal wound that would elevate it. Leo’s confession is handled well, but Elara remains more of a compassionate functionary than a complex individual whose own core is at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, “calm defiance,” is expertly tested by a specific, dramatized moment of vulnerability. The story’s central turn hinges on her character-consistent choice to encrypt her fear rather than succumb to it. This action feels both surprising and inevitable, earning the final reconfiguration of her purpose with a visible cost—the end of her solitary work.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and drives the narrative effectively. The internal conflict is clear—a need that "eclipsed fear or duty." The final choice to take only her own memory and leave the others demonstrates an earned change, a renunciation that feels both costly and peaceful. Interiority is strong, though the line about love being "cleanly excised from her mind" leans slightly toward summary over embodied experience, which holds it just shy of a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is exceptionally coherent. Aeliana's defining trait—her command of tranquility—is not just stated but becomes the active mechanism for the plot. Her motivation is dire yet her method is patient, creating a compelling internal dynamic. The struggle is palpable in the "agonizingly slow" pace, grounding her immense power with a clear sense of effort and making the final release of will feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is established immediately and compellingly, driving the entire narrative. Mr. Valerius is an exceptionally drawn character, his frailness and ancient knowledge creating a coherent, memorable presence. The concept of their relationship being built on "agreed upon lies" provides a sophisticated layer of internal conflict and character dynamic, which is paid off beautifully when Elara decides to break the fiction. The final transformation from student to scribe feels earned and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal contradiction as a “charmed skeptic” is compelling, driving her actions against her own established worldview. The final change is earned through a specific, dramatized experience. The interiority is slightly weakened by a few lines that read as diagnostic summary, such as "mistaking the suppression of grief for strength," which momentarily pulls back from embodied experience into abstract analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaelin’s motivation is powerful and clear, and Varos's parallel motivation is revealed with great economy. Her internal state is well-embodied through her physical control and later shock. The final shift in her understanding is slightly summarized ("Kaelin understood") rather than fully processed on the page, a minor missed opportunity for deeper interiority at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and provides a powerful engine for the narrative. Her transformation from passive listener to active preserver is earned through the story's central revelation. However, her interiority lacks contradictory impulses; her path from question to acceptance is linear, missing the deeper friction of a dramatized internal conflict that would elevate an already strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, serving as a strong engine for the narrative. However, her interiority reads more as a statement of purpose than a dramatized internal conflict; contradictory impulses are described rather than shown in action. The story effectively portrays her competence, but a moment of genuine struggle or a difficult micro-choice would have elevated the characterization from a skilled operator to a more deeply felt protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ren's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but he reads as a somewhat static "wise master" archetype. The characterization is more of a philosophical demonstration than a portrayal of a person with internal contradictions or struggle. The lack of any visible internal conflict or flaw, even a minor one, keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. The narrative pivots on the contradiction between her stated compulsion—to debunk lies—and her ultimate choice to preserve one. This internal conflict is earned through the discovery process, making the final renunciation of her core principle a powerful, costly change. The epiphany feels slightly accelerated but is well-contextualized by the sensory deprivation and intensity of the storm, preventing it from reading as unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clearly established motivation and a potent internal conflict. The choice between lonely integrity and compromised belonging is dramatized effectively. The final character beat, "alone, but no longer lonely," provides a resonant and earned closure to his internal arc, directly stemming from his decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from a general mission to a specific quest. The shift from "collector" to "archeologist of joy" is a strong thematic beat. However, the final claim of "redemption" feels unearned, as the story never establishes a prior failure or guilt that requires it; this makes the character's final emotional resolution feel slightly imposed rather than fully developed from internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction, being "logically emotional," is not just stated but dramatized as the core conflict; his initial logical failure forces an intuitive, emotional solution. The interiority during the moment of panic feels earned and specific, leading directly to the pivotal change in tactics. This choice is earned by prior causality and has a visible cost in his struggle, making the final quiet triumph resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, centered on the potent internal contradiction of sculpting patience from impatience. This motivation is not merely stated but embodied in her meticulous actions, and its resolution is the story's core payoff. The final transformation into the "keeper" is an earned reconfiguration of her identity, fulfilling the arc with a felt cost—the shedding of her restless, striving self.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s transformation from a detached observer to an empathetic witness is compelling. The internal conflict between her professional methodology and the psychic data is well-dramatized. The final state of "fortified vulnerability" is an earned and precise description of her change, avoiding a simplistic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The motivations for Father Vale and the deceased prisoner are clear and compelling. Liam's shift from professional curiosity to thematic understanding is also credible. The primary weakness is the final paragraph's articulation of Liam's understanding, which reads more like an authorial thesis statement ("redemption is not a state of being granted...") than earned, character-particular interiority, constituting a mild Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fix's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. The character is defined by a singular trait, "steadily curious," which pays off directly in the climax when they grab the kaleidoscope. The final emotional beat—laughing with "irreverent awe"—is a strong, earned culmination of their obsessive, logical journey colliding with cosmic wonder. The interiority could be slightly more embodied before the final paragraphs, but the core arc is sound and compelling for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, beginning as an intellectual curiosity that deepens into a moral imperative. The transition is sharp and credible, especially in the moment her purpose "crystallized." Her core trait, "brightly attentive," is slightly on-the-nose as a label, but it is effectively dramatized by her actions, justifying her persistence. The interiority is focused and goal-oriented, successfully avoiding generic emotional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation to shift from a static guardian to an active intervenor is the story's core, but the transition feels abrupt. Her change is explained with summary ("The plea was a key turning a lock deep within her prescribed purpose") rather than dramatized through internal conflict. While her initial character is clear, the leap to mobilizing an entire village feels more like a necessary plot function than an earned character development.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and undergoes a compelling evolution from a desire for death to a nuanced quest for understanding. Her interiority is specific and concrete, particularly in the opening ("drift-ice marina of the mind"). The change is earned through action, but the final epiphany feels slightly too self-aware and articulated, where a more embodied or less declarative realization might have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to rediscover herself is clear and compelling. The interiority is rich, particularly in how her observations of the vines fuel her internal processing. The final change feels earned, but the expression of her epiphany—"They cultivate the soil of the soul for a different, more resilient crop"—borders on diagnostic therapy-speak, slightly flattening the emotional authenticity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Line Walker’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent with his established methodology. The prophet serves as an effective, if archetypal, foil, with his “strangely honest” condescension providing palpable pressure. The protagonist’s voice slightly falters with the line, “They are libraries for feelings too complex for words,” which reads more like an authorial thesis statement than an in-character utterance, a minor slip in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies more on labels ("subtle puzzle archivist," "perceptively calm") than on embodied emotion or internal conflict. She functions effectively as a lens for the story's discovery, but her internal world lacks the specific contradictions that would make her feel deeply individual. The repetition of "perceptively calm" at the beginning and end feels like a narrative frame rather than an earned state.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s transformation from “reticent scholar” to public witness is well-motivated and compelling. Her interiority is concrete, and the change is earned through the story's central discovery. The transition is slightly marred by a moment of telling over showing with the line "A profound weathered innocence settled over Elara," which labels the emotional state rather than fully embodying it in the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elara's singular motivation and paradoxical flaw ("precognitively forgetful") generate a compelling internal conflict, which is brilliantly externalized through her actions—particularly the choice to trust her past self's driftwood marker over her present feeling. The final moment, where the impulse to act is erased by a vision of futility, earns the story's tragic stasis with a cost that is both profound and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—the “luminous ache” to “harness the ephemeral”—is both clear and deeply felt, providing a powerful engine for the narrative. Her competence under duress is demonstrated, not just stated, through her “economical and sure” movements during the crisis. The story earns her final internal shift, transforming the ache from one of longing to one of fulfilled preservation, a change with a legible and immense cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with it. The interiority is concrete, especially her focused calm under pressure. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward over-articulation, as seen in the initial setup ("crystallized: to execute a flawless goodbye") and final reflection, which states her success a little too directly rather than letting the final image carry all the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the entire narrative. Her defining trait of being "quietly deliberate" is shown effectively through her actions, providing a solid contrast to her internal anticipation. However, her interiority, while consistent, lacks deeper conflict or contradiction; her emotional state is reported more than it is embodied, keeping the characterization from achieving exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris's motivation is clear and her core contradiction as a "forgiving skeptic" is established early. Her actions, particularly setting the bone, are well-grounded in brief but effective backstory. The primary weakness is a moment of over-articulated self-awareness ("to turn mistakes into constellations") that feels more like a thematic summary than an organic thought a character would have mid-crisis, slightly flattening the interiority at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The integration of her grandmother's wisdom provides a strong psychological anchor for her final choice. However, the internal conflict feels more like a gentle puzzle than a struggle with contradictory impulses; her path to the solution is meditative and linear, lacking a moment of true doubt or a competing desire that would elevate the characterization into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions, from her pilgrimage to the data center to the final choice to proffer her pendant. The internal conflict is well-embodied, and the final change is earned through the interaction with Kael. The characterization loses a fraction of a point for moments of diagnostic self-awareness, particularly the phrase “protected vulnerability,” which labels the feeling rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen's motivation and internal conflict are clear and character-specific. However, the final change from blocked novelist to inspired artist happens in a single beat following the woman's story, feeling more like a convenient epiphany than a fully earned internal shift. The speed of this resolution slightly undermines the depth of the initial paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization as a "tinkerer" is dissonant with the resolution, which relies on memory and song, not mechanics. The contraption works more like a magical totem than a piece of engineering, creating a slight mismatch between her described identity and her decisive action. Her internal state shifts from despair to hope very quickly with little dramatized struggle, resting on the convenient arrival of a memory.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal conflict between her past as a “flash-paper alchemist” of “quick, brilliant burns” and her present quest for permanence. Her motivation is deeply felt and her actions, particularly the physical embodiment of patience, are rendered with concrete specificity. The backstory is efficiently integrated, directly fueling the on-page action without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the core character trait of being "peripherally focused." The desire "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" is a powerful, specific internal driver that justifies the entire plot. Her actions as a locksmith—meticulous, patient, reverse-engineering a complex mechanism—are a perfect external manifestation of her interiority, making her competence feel earned rather than assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, realized through embodied emotion and a climactic choice rooted in professional ethos rather than personal sentiment. Elara's internal conflict—her competence warring with her own dread—is dramatized effectively when her fear taints the connection. The final act of acceptance over resistance is a powerful, earned resolution that demonstrates her deep understanding of her craft, foreclosing the path of struggle with the visible cost of being permanently marked by the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear, sharp motivation ("harvest lessons from loss") and specific, embodied interiority. The turn from seeking an image to finding a sensation is a masterful piece of internal movement. A hairline deduction is for the final paragraph, where the realization is slightly summarized ("what he had taught her...") rather than resting entirely within the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation to “negotiate with one's own ghost” is clear and compellingly executed. Her internal conflict between eroded resolve and sharp regret is dramatized effectively through the act of turning the camera wheel. The final confrontation with her younger self provides a strong, earned change in her perspective, with the cost being a full acceptance of her misdirected life. The characterization is specific and avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "functionally creative" trait is demonstrated effectively. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary (e.g., "Her goal crystallized") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional arc is one of competent success, lacking a deeper, contradictory internal conflict or a more visceral personal cost, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between silence and music is well-drawn. The final choice to offer the music sheet is a strong, embodied action that pays off her arc. The epiphany, “Her abandoned dream had not been about being heard... but about listening,” verges on being too diagnostic, but is immediately grounded by action, narrowly avoiding a penalty for over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is clear, consistent, and provides a strong engine for the narrative. The final change is earned and forecloses his old way of life with a palpable conceptual cost. The interiority is concrete, effectively capturing the shift from seeker to one who was sought, avoiding simplistic epiphanies until the final, earned moment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. Her interiority, however, occasionally leans on abstract labels ("philosophical seed collector," "harvested understanding") rather than fully embodied perception. The central trait of "infinite patience" is well-demonstrated through her sustained effort, making the final breakthrough feel earned rather than convenient, but the lack of any internal contradiction or friction makes the characterization feel slightly static, albeit purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Countess is characterized beautifully through her posture, her silences, and the final revealing of her core memory; her shift from contained grief to grateful acknowledgment is subtle and earned. Elias is more of a catalyst, his motivation clear and consistent, but his interiority serves the concept more than it reveals a complex inner conflict. The character work is very strong, just shy of flawless due to the protagonist's functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is powerfully established and consistently drives the narrative. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the moment of discovery, which is a “crushing duality of profound loss and impossible hope.” The final emotional state of succeeding and failing utterly is a complex, earned contradiction that lands with significant weight, fulfilling the criteria for exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, and her central paradox (arsonist's daughter/firefighter) provides a strong foundation. Her interiority is concrete, especially in her focus on the physical materials. The final action feels earned, a culmination of her stated goal and the quiet ritual she performs. The only slight weakness is the direct labeling of her core trait as "unyielding compassion," which borders on diagnostic summary rather than letting the specific action of grafting carry the full weight of that characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elara as a "luminous skeptic" is exemplary, creating a core internal contradiction that drives the plot. Her motivation is established with poignant specificity ("liberate trapped memories"), and her actions consistently reflect her "realistically imaginative mind." The shift from attempting physical force to embracing "sidereal patience" represents an earned character change, with the cost of her vigil made palpable over seven days.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, and her core internal conflict—adherence to a generational pattern of non-interference versus the need to protect her home—is the story's engine. The change is earned, as the pressure of the probe forces her to re-evaluate her core tenet. The final choice to break the cycle is a powerful and well-supported character moment, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for an earned renunciation with a visible cost (the breaking of her inherited identity).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliran's motivation is clear and consistent with his meditative profession. The final change is earned through the story's central sensory experience. However, the epiphany is articulated with a touch of diagnostic self-awareness ("he understood his true motivation: to discover the shape of collective grief"), which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise subtle internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his “ethically diligent” nature which drives the entire plot. The interiority during the “searing reverie” is potent, conveying the weight of his task. The final change is an earned understanding rather than a sudden personality shift, making his character arc feel both profound and believable.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her initial state as "blithe" feels more like a label set up for a simple reversal than a deeply embodied trait. The final change to "settled with a newfound gravity" is earned by the discovery, but the transition itself is asserted in the final paragraph rather than dramatized through a complex internal reaction or choice. The characterization is effective but lacks the nuance of contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. The "groundedly imaginative" trait is well-demonstrated through his thought process, moving from a single data point to a revolutionary idea. The characterization is slightly constrained by a lack of deeper personal flaws beyond the central intellectual challenge, making his ultimate success feel one of pure, frictionless competence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her established diligence. The link between her professional "thistled calm" and the method for nurturing the dust is a strong character-driven connection. However, the interiority occasionally relies on summary, as in "Desperation turned to revelation," which labels the emotional shift rather than embodying the contradictory feelings of that transition in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and poignant: not to memorialize, but to “crystallize a fleeting emotion.” Her interiority is concrete, tracing her realization that her art is a “mirage of safety,” a self-deception. The internal conflict between the desire for a permanent image and the acceptance of transient truth is dramatized through her process, culminating in a final act that is both a renunciation and a fulfillment, earning its emotional weight with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict is well-dramatized as a "battlefield" between sanctioned history and physical evidence. However, the emotional states, while conceptually interesting ("abrasive calm," "furious peace"), are more labeled than embodied, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.6)
    Eliza’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear motivation that is tested and deepened under pressure. The shift from "expectantly resigned" to "profound, bittersweet peace" is an earned, resonant change, not a summary. Her internal conflict—a quiet dedication warring with the reality of loss—is dramatized through her precise, metaphorical teaching method rather than being stated, fulfilling the highest standard of showing character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from hollow to hopeful is earned through on-page action. The characterization is strong, but select moments of interiority, such as "felt a motivation ignite," are stated rather than embodied. While the final change is powerful, it is slightly over-articulated, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arawn's characterization is strong and consistent. The core motivation—a duty complicated by a deep-seated fear of disappointment—is established economically and tested by the plot. The "involuntarily truthful" trait pays off effectively in the admission of fear, linking his internal state to the external crisis. The final choice feels earned, flowing directly from the tension between function and the "wonder" his grandfather prized.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a "noticer" is established with immediate clarity and specificity. The transition from detached observer to active participant is the story's core arc and feels earned within the compressed timeframe. Her interiority is concrete, though the final realization verges on being slightly too articulated, echoing the thematic summary in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Veridian’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sophisticated, shifting from a manufactured certainty to a desire for nuance. This philosophical shift is earned by the traumatic revelation and powerfully dramatized in the final self-destructive choice. The interiority is concrete, tracking his evolution from a static guardian to a conscious agent. The transition from revelation to action is perhaps slightly too swift for a being who has existed in stasis for eons, but for this length, the efficiency serves the story's momentum well.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, establishing the central contradiction of "grim optimist" and making it the engine of the plot. Her motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is a high-concept, abstract desire that is successfully grounded in her specific actions. The final choice is a perfect synthesis of her meticulous and daring nature, earned through the preceding internal struggle against a system of perfect order.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—the "hollow stillness" of her creative block—is well-established. Her actions, particularly the impulsive decision to write on the glass, feel consistent with her "methodically hopeful" nature when presented with a new stimulus. The characterization is slightly weakened by the final paragraph, where the narration summarizes her epiphany ("she had proof that strangers remember kindness"), which reads more like a thematic statement than a raw, earned moment of interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict between her "studied calm" and "cold and sharp" panic is well-embodied. The shift from a passive preserver to an active seeker is earned through the crucible of the crisis, culminating in a final choice that redefines her purpose with a visible cost—the acceptance of a new, more difficult quest.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eliran's motivation is established with unusual clarity and specificity—not just to reverse time, but "to step beyond fate's design." This intellectual hubris is consistently embodied in his "frantic yet precise energy" and the core emotional paradox of "bleak exhilaration." The characterization is powerful and serves the concept perfectly, with his final feeling of triumph being immediately and ironically undercut by the consequences, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is primal and clear, and his internal state of terror is well-embodied. The transformation from victim to "unburdened" is earned within the scene. However, his agency is largely reactive, following the explicit instructions of the advisor, which slightly tempers the complexity of his character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular and powerfully executed, but he reads more as a mythic archetype than a complex individual. His interiority is poetic but lacks the friction of internal conflict; his competence is so complete that the struggle remains entirely external. The final emotional state is earned through physical cost, which is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait—a cartographer's obsession with patterns—is precisely what enables the resolution. The final emotional state is a sophisticated shift from pure dread to a nuanced fusion of dread and purpose, an earned change that feels authentic. Her competence is established and tested, making her climactic choice feel both inevitable and momentous.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris's motivation is clear and his core trait of being "emotionally rational" is effectively tested. The internal conflict is present, and his shift from isolated scholar to committed ally is earned through Elara's evidence-based appeal. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("He had spent his life believing that truth was found in isolation... Elara was showing him it was found in connection"), which verges on diagnostic summary rather than purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ansel's motivation is compelling and consistent, rooted in the concrete action of his secret vocation. His internal conflict between stoic duty and sensitive resonance is well-established. However, the pivot when Elara arrives feels slightly unearned; his stoicism falters and she "understood immediately," which bypasses a layer of potential tension and accelerates the thematic resolution at the cost of psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The characterization is strong and consistent; Silas’s core attribute of being “tranquilly perceptive” is effectively dramatized in his reaction to the blackout. His motivation is the clear engine for the entire plot. The execution is held back from the highest tier only by a lack of significant internal conflict; his frustration is brief and his resolve is rarely tested by a competing desire or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leo’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, driving every action from the inciting incident to the final image. The interiority is beautifully rendered, progressing from a "void so profound" and "luminous torment" to a state of luminous peace. This transformation is earned through a costly, character-specific choice, fulfilling the narrative arc with a profound and credible emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in a specific, haunting backstory. The internal conflict is rendered with visceral, contradictory emotions like "bleak exhilaration" and "terrifying euphoria," avoiding any diagnostic summary. The final choice to permeate the pool of potential feels both surprising and inevitable, an earned culmination of his search, with the cost of his trauma explicitly integrated into the resolution: "the bleakness of his loss was a dark current within it."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's transformation from a technician guided by orders to a custodian of a "sacred duty" is effective for this length. Her professional mindset as a drone pilot provides a specific lens for solving the puzzle ("constellations not as pictures but as data points"), grounding the story's more mystical elements. The shift in motivation at the end feels slightly abrupt but is sold by the sensory detail of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between cynical professionalism and buried guilt is exceptionally well-dramatized. The evolution from a “cultivated,” “tempered regret” to an “acute and devastating” but “clean” feeling is an earned and satisfying character arc. Her final choice feels both surprising in the moment and inevitable in hindsight, fulfilling the 9+ test for contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, and her internal conflict is legible. The way Kael’s shame mirrors her own creates a strong relational crucible. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of overly articulate self-awareness, such as when her internal thought process neatly summarizes the theme (“The mistake was not just hers to recycle; it was theirs to share and transcend”), which feels more like an authorial conclusion than an organic, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction of a "broken navigator" is made tangible through specific actions and a well-realized internal state. The change from being anchored by grand regrets to finding peace in modest progress is earned and emotionally resonant. The phrase "merrily melancholic" is a particular highlight, capturing a complex, authentic inner state that persists even through the story's positive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. The internal conflict is well-established, particularly the contrast between her "clinical mind" and the "gentle" hands in the final scene, which provides a strong, embodied moment of change. The arc from an abstract seeker to an active participant is earned. A minor point of friction is the slightly over-articulated interiority, such as "a walking paradox," which labels the state more than it embodies it in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply felt, driving the narrative with credible force. The internal conflict between dwelling in grief and acting for redemption is well-dramatized, especially in the moment of choice before the memory rift. The "reluctant metamorphosis" is earned, but phrases like this and "cosmic intimacy" verge on diagnostic labeling, slightly abstracting an otherwise embodied emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, clear, and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The shift from a "gnawing hunger" to being "peacefully resolved" is earned through a specific, character-rooted insight rather than an unearned epiphany. Her rejection of the "cloudbound repentance" as not her own repository reveals a nuanced internal value system. The final choice to return to the family ritual is a perfect culmination of her arc, showing a meaningful change with the felt cost of abandoning her grander, more arcane quest.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Steward's characterization is exceptional, with motivation that is both clear and deeply felt. The internal conflict—needing to immerse in the grief it was built to mitigate—is compelling. Emotion is masterfully embodied through the physical mechanic of changing mass, making "a depression made physically manifest" a literal, tangible reality that grounds the entire narrative and provides a visible cost to every action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her climactic realization reads more like an authorial thesis than an earned, embodied epiphany. The shift from a character experiencing transformation to one delivering a precise, abstract summary ("the quiet coalescence of intention and accident, of loss and purpose") feels overly articulated and lessens the emotional impact of her journey. While the motivation is strong, the character's final interiority lacks the messy, personal texture the story claims to be about.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysander’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his characterization lacks compelling internal conflict. His serenity is absolute ("did not startle," "remarkably serene"), making him feel more like a flawless archetype than a person under pressure. Vorlag's shift from antagonist to hopeful observer is swift but justified by the line, "He had chosen his first audience carefully," which suggests a pre-existing understanding of her suppressed desires.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kael’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the narrative. The internal conflict between his chaotic precognition and his desire for order is well-dramatized, not just stated. His final choice to face destruction rather than break his promise is a powerful, earned moment that perfectly reveals his hierarchy of values, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, evolving from a need to understand past loss into a readiness to navigate the future. The internal contradiction is powerful—her need for the truth warring with the pain it represents. The story earns its final shift by showing her move past the self-defined mask of "the victim," a choice with a clear and tangible psychological cost that redefines her entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The characters are elegant archetypes in service of a strong concept, with clear, shared motivation. The shift from opponents to partners is effectively executed at the close. However, their interiority remains somewhat abstract; they are defined more by their function and skill ("philosopher," "diplomat") than by any specific, contradictory impulses shown in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas's core motivation and his central trait ("molting personalities") are established early and paid off effectively in the final beat, framing a coherent internal arc. His transformation feels slightly accelerated but is conceptually sound. Elara is more functional, but her brief characterization is effective; the relationship serves as a credible crucible for Silas's change, though the "spark" itself is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her professional competence drives the plot. However, her core internal motive, "to surprise fate," feels more like an abstract authorial overlay than a deeply embodied need that forces difficult choices. She solves the problem with impressive skill but without any internal conflict or flaw-driven missteps, which makes her feel more like a function of the plot than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s defining internal conflict—her "luminous doubt"—is established immediately and drives the narrative. The contradiction between her empirical training and her intuitive, faith-based duty is consistently dramatized. Her shift in perspective is earned through frustration and exhaustion leading to the dream state, making the final choice to "waken" the seed a credible transformation rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen’s motivation is clear and potent, and his internal conflict is well-realized. The character arc is earned through the story's central trial. However, the resolution relies on a diagnostic label—"It was forgiveness"—which slightly undermines the preceding embodied experience by summarizing it too neatly, a minor but distinct flaw in an otherwise strong characterization.

    Lyra's motivation evolves credibly from survival to purposeful action, rooted in her adaptive trait and embodied through micro-choices like studying frost patterns; interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing her shattered self repairing amid lingering trauma. The final renunciation of quiet isolation forecloses her old path with felt emotional cost, evident in the shift from granular pauses to loud enactment. Strengths shine in her artist-to-avenger arc, but minor stock phrasing in reflections slightly dilutes specificity at the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and intensifies through his internal conflict, culminating in the decision to declare the truth, which forecloses reliance on illusion with a felt cost of shifting hope's source. Interiority is concrete, embodied in his breath catching upon seeing Maever, revealing contradictory impulses of gratitude and concern. Maever, as a secondary character, applies pressure by embodying wiser persistence, forcing Kael's stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation from the past life memory is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in her traits as a spiritually curious artist, with embodied emotions like trembling hands and deep breathing revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The final shift to becoming a conduit is earned through prior micro-choices, such as tracing the wavering image, foreclosing her old path with the felt cost of emotional flooding and weeping.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive trap, intensifying through the discovery to compel the climatic unpick of the temporal stitch, with embodied emotions like the burning palm revealing character under pressure. Interior conflict shows contradictory impulses, such as her perpetual snag on the past versus her drive to unfold it, culminating in an earned change with the cost of disintegrating photographs. The relationship with her mother, once on-page, forces a choice that alters their state, though secondary pressure feels slightly underdeveloped. Voice distinction is strong in Elara's perceptual idiom, avoiding stock phrasing.

    The Liberator's motivation to protect the seeds is clear and intensifies through his chained burden, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost as he seals himself in; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the chain's weight reminding him of promises. However, the character leans archetypal without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting depth.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a profound yearning for destiny's whisper, intensifying to compel her high-stakes leap; interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses evident when panic arises but she commands herself to think like light.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “quiet terror of deep-space mathematics” and “robotic” clearing motions reveal the armor. The shift from quantifying loss to cataloguing dust is credible, but the final humility feels slightly pre-articulated rather than earned in a single micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s shift from passive survival to active justice is embodied in micro-choices—scratching the frost, climbing the rim—each with tactile cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs resolve—are embodied in the fork’s vibration and the color blooms; her micro-choice to press the fork to the glass crystallizes her arc with visible cost (the surrender of sound for visual music).

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s stubbornness is dramatized through the micro-choice to fit the imperfect lens rather than abandon the task; the embodied cost—physical strain and the grandfather’s dissolution—lands on the page. Interiority is specific to his profession (“give rest a permanent address”) and refracted through sensory detail. The Earned Stasis of completing the cycle while accepting imperfection is credible and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s fear of outside dependency vs his devotion to communal self-reliance fuels every decision; the discovery of Maever’s deception tilts his value hierarchy on the page.  Maever, though mostly off-stage, exerts direct pressure through the nightly “donations” and the final knowing glance, forcing Kael’s renunciation.  Interiority is embodied and conflicted without lapsing into abstraction (“weight strapped to his soul”).  A visible choice occurs at the very end when Kael decides to declare an alternate story, paying the cost of surrendering absolute truth in exchange for communal hope—a crystallised Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from artist to conduit is earned through micro-choices (tracing, breathing, kneeling). The flaw—spiritual passivity—compounds until the tear forces action. Cost is felt: she weeps, love pours in, work begins. One hairline slip: “unused love” is named rather than dramatized at the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile obsession with “grain of time” anchors motive—but the mother’s reappearance feels slightly under-motivated; we don’t see Elara weigh cost before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Liberator’s single-minded purpose and embodied resignation read vividly; yet his interiority lacks textured contradiction. His final, self-imprisoned choice is fully motivated and carries palpable cost. No second character receives distinct internal space, but the brief confrontation still tests resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for destiny’s whisper while fearing unworthiness—are embodied in the trembling jar and the leap onto the gantry. The final beat crystallizes her cost: she is “temporary, unworthy guardian,” a renunciation that forecloses any return to innocence. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; her “luminous disbelief” is felt, not labeled. One minor slip: the witch backstory is summary-only and does not tilt a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bookmark ritual and glass-blowing monologue reveal contradictory impulses (guilt vs creation). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “weighty lightness” edges toward label-speak at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—trembling hands vs. adaptive precision—yet the “phobia-ridden” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the dive; the final weeping ascent earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession with silence is embodied in tactile ritual—smoothing vellum, tracing stone—so motive is legible. Yet the interior contradiction (fear vs compulsion) is stated more than dramatized; no moment shows her tempted to break the silence she craves. The final renunciation—accepting the completed map and the path it opens—earns its poise, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Unit 734’s single-minded curiosity is palpable and embodied in every micro-adjustment of its manipulators; the contradiction between its programmed composure and the escalating risk of self-erasure is dramatized rather than stated. The final choice to merge timelines is earned by prior beats of experimentation and carries a visible cost—the loss of the violin and the fracturing of its own continuity. Interiority remains specific to a robot’s sensorium without lapsing into generic “robot feelings.”

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anya’s interiority is precise—her “need to understand” and later mercy are embodied in micro-choices (lens use, incinerator).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—preserving beauty while orchestrating decay—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (polishing marbles, propping leaves).

One hairline slip: “wisely pragmatic” is label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (brass lever, disengaging wrist) and Vesh’s shift from icy doubt to raw discovery is credible; the cost—Vesh’s worldview shattered—is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the hall vs. duty to Valerius—play out in embodied micro-choices (tuning to drips, playing the rests). The final renunciation (letting the building collapse) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the groaning stone.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crucible-sharp tension between observational detachment and eruptive awe; fever-to-fever-break arc earns the final resolve micro-choice “cross-referencing timestamps” carries tangible embodied cost (weak legs, tremor). One residual label (“auroral sorrow”) slips into diagnostic abstraction without immediate corporeal offset – the single hairline scrape that holds the score under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara emerges as distinctly reckless yet intellectually skeptical; her decisions and embodied emotions (the drowsy alertness that sharpens under pressure) directly force the apocalyptic valve turn and the uncovering of the foreman’s confession. Internal contradiction is visible in her simultaneous fear of the ghosts and compulsion to uncover truth. The shift from curious explorer to bearer of swallowed truth is cleanly earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from passive witness to active healer is earned through the rupture’s pressure and the swan’s instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied (e.g., “watched Leo, not the sky”), and his softly adaptive trait drives the decisive choice to use the vial at totality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Alistair’s shift from passive collector to active scribe is embodied and earned; the grief is palpable, the choice to “become the wall” carries visible cost. Interiority is textured, though a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“odd historian”) nicks the score.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s interior contradiction—prophetic power vs. weary guilt—drives every beat; the micro-choice to risk Lena’s autonomy for her “transposition” carries visible cost in his lowered binoculars and enigmatic resignation. Lena remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; Eli’s self-interrogation is vivid but slightly generalized in the final paragraph, keeping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ansel’s interiority is embodied (cold fog seeking cracks) and his micro-choice to press the white thumb is earned by prior causality. The contradiction between compassion and analytical detachment is present but under-exploited; Carver’s recovery feels slightly convenient, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the homesickness-as-melody conceit is sustained without therapy-speak. The final renunciation—accepting memory over literal return—earns its cost through prior exhaustion and the visible collapse. Minor slip: “chronologically homesick” is a label that never gets dramatized in dialogue or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid— embodied grief and gravitational defiance track under pressure— but some timeline flashbacks are summarized rather than dramatized, muting contradiction expression.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inara’s interior contradiction – her drive to defeat numbness by embracing greater silence – is embodied and specific; her final micro-choice to stage the recital crystallizes her arc with felt cost (“she had not restored sound, but remade silence”). Leo’s transformation remains functional but less textured. Causation and motivation are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and specific; contradictory impulses (“quiet observer” vs “urgent activist”) clash in real time and drive the final, irreversible choice. The quiet solitude/integrity arc earns an Earned Stasis that lands with vivid cost—loss of personal peace for wider truth. Minor slips in emotional symmetry but no template blandness.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s wistful empathy and Silas’s buried joy are embodied through micro-choices (offering the vial, removing the mask) and contradictory impulses (grief vs wonder). The final reunion with memory carries visible emotional cost, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rope’s history is felt in his fingers and choices. The final renunciation is earned by the mirrored prison-escape memory and the immediate ethical weight. Minor slip: “ethically playful” is asserted more than dramatized in the beings’ behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelin’s stubborn interiority (“quiet, stubborn force”) and embodied ritual choice (bow still, eyes closed) earn her renunciation of melody for listening; the bowl’s generational weight and her acoustic gift visibly cost her the safety of silence and foreclose nostalgic retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her need to feel nothing to craft perfect feelings—drives every beat; the final “quiet, aching loneliness” is earned by her prior renunciation of real empathy. Micro-choices (pressing the petal to sap, inhaling) reveal hierarchy of values. Flaw (emotional sterility) complicates and costs. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent; the interiority is modest but embodied in the clenched brass box and purposeful stride. The micro-choice to hand over the locket is credible and alters the relational state. However, Maeve’s interiority is reported rather than dramatized, and the final “friendship kindled” feels slightly tidy given the brief interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelin’s ache and need to belong are embodied in every choice; the final act of hanging the woven ring is earned by prior longing and communal discovery. Interiority is concrete (“luminescent ache,” “quiet, desperate need”), and the shift from lone artisan to community anchor carries visible social cost. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is not tested; the arc is internal but fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive to “find the place where echoes are born” is clear and embodied in her sensory focus and the pendant twist. Interiority is vivid but occasionally drifts into abstract longing rather than concrete contradiction. The final sacrifice feels earned because the pendant’s history is tied to her lineage, yet the emotional cost is stated more than dramatized in body or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (logic vs. longing) play out in micro-choices like placing the glass eyes on the mosaic. The final renunciation—accepting the unsolvable—earns its cost through prior struggle. A hairline slip: “undefined loss” is named rather than dramatized, blunting the flaw’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile navigation of the library and the ghost-memory moment reveal contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-erasure). The final choice—to leave the box openly—earns her “visibility” through prior causality and carries a quiet cost (permanent anonymity). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—control vs surrender—is embodied in micro-choices (opening vents, turning off systems) and culminates in visible renunciation. The shift from data tablet to blank screen carries felt cost. Minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis” is named rather than dramatized in body.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s insomnia and artistic paralysis are embodied in raw eyes and untouched canvas; his choice to trade the bread is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The woman’s single line of dialogue carries status and stakes, but her interior remains opaque. The final renunciation (his supper) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “haggard awe” is label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her failure to foresee the pilgrim, her wariness, her embodied use of lantern light—but the pilgrim remains a silhouette of motive; his darker purpose is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices, muting the relational crucible and the cost she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s exile-driven need to “compile fragments into meaning” is embodied in her tactile handling of the valve and her measured public revelation; the final crystallization of deliberate sabotage is earned by her reactive-visionary trait and costs her the safety of silence. Interiority is specific (“salt-tang…familiar ghost”) and her micro-choice to accuse the old rulers carries visible social risk. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory phrasing (“she realized…”) that slightly abstracts the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s meticulous nature and artistic lens are embodied in her noticing cracks-as-arrows and translating sound into visual scores; the interior contradiction between order and chaos is dramatized when she chooses the largest door, trading her maps for the library. The cost—loss of her former life—is legible in the final tremor. Yet the “fortress” motivation is asserted more than dramatized before the vault scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist’s rigor colliding with whale-borne empathy—is embodied in micro-choices (the first touch of the tile, the final broadcast) and results in a credible renunciation: he abandons “data over wonder” to become the whales’ mirror, a change that both costs and recharges his original stake.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s ennui-to-focus arc is embodied in micro-choices (finger on facet, shard aloft) and the final “thread of intrigue” that compels her exit. The betrayal backstory is anchored to present action via the goodbye question, but the Architects remain off-page, limiting relational crucible. Flaw (apathy) is confronted and paid for by the amulet’s destruction. Motivation is clear and escalates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives every beat; the passport reveal liquefies her rigid anger with embodied cost (“the certainty… began to liquefy”). Micro-choice of slipping the passport into her clutch seals the arc. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“hands still dusted with flecks of precious foil,” “breathing slowed to match the rhythm”—but the final renunciation (leaving the mountain with the collected textures) is more stated than dramatized; the cost is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Protagonist's drive (“not to reclaim but discover texture of memory”) is consistent; interiority vivid without clichés. Final resolve—to bear witness without a name—earned by prior choices and carries felt cost: “keeper of the silence” in last paragraph crystallizes renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—career skeptic vs. secret believer—drives every beat; the tactile habit of thumb on shell and the micro-choice to bow the cello embody her pivot. Late-life urgency is palpable, yet the “gloomy cheerfulness” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rio’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradictory: her “humming mix of hopeful desperation” is shown through micro-choices (accepting the chip, painting the maze, pocketing the stone). Dual allegiance is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final smile is earned because the bridge tactic has been seeded by earlier beats. Only a hairline slip: the net-mender’s dialogue is slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “purposefully curious” trait is dramatized through the painstaking camera set-up and the decision to stay after the shot; the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and private grief is palpable. The final stance—standing her ground while the drill hums—earns its cost because the acid timer and the vanished grain have already literalized the price of patience. No head-count issues; single-POV interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only limit: we get one micro-choice (stay) rather than a full arc of changing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied interiority—reading fractures through water ripples—feels singular and consistent; the final renunciation (letting the drone go) carries visible cost in her solitude. Blindness is not token but causally shapes every micro-choice. Minor slip: the engineer’s plea is summarized rather than dramatized, softening relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s cartographer’s compulsion is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to close the phrasebook and step onto the ice crystallizes the interior contradiction between mapping and witnessing. The final renunciation—accepting the epitaph instead of the chart—carries visible cost in the erased condensation map. One hairline slip: “subtly confident” is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of kneeling on the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her “infinite patience” is dramatized through deliberate footfalls and the fork’s measured strikes. The final stance—accepting an eternal memory rather than full resurrection—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her earlier recognition of “discordant shiver.” No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vance is credibly drawn—his lonely drive and risk-taking embody the mission, not simply state it. Interior contradiction (rescue vs. desire to “harness the ephemeral”) stays active through the beats. Micro-choice to open the vial overrides every instinct and reconfigures both stakes and emotional position with visible cost. Earned renunciation of violence feels specific to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“his own inherited sin was silence”); micro-choice with lattice as shield crystallizes stance; lies-as-survival rooted in multi-generational flaw; cost is visible quiet he must now live within; meets single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“hands, pale as moonstone”), her contradictory impulses (grief vs duty) act simultaneously, and the final renunciation of the bead carries visible cost. The ghost bride’s pressure is felt but remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thea’s interior contradiction—haunting optimism against communal grief—remains embodied in every beat; her nightly sewing of air and stone is a micro-choice that visibly costs sleep and safety. The final renunciation of “rebuild as before” is earned by the prior dream-walking labor and the quartz veins she etches. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is solo and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—fingertips brushing sun-warm stone, a “thrilling sense of discovery”—yet motivation slips slightly abstract on first arrival, and the final resolve feels more stated than earned through observable contradiction. Still, her embodied dread among her own bones and the cost of accepting the shadow as gnomon give the decision visible personal freight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his longing for “a simpler past he’d never known” crystallizes motive—but the client remains a cipher; her marginalia never complicates his stance, so the crucible is one-sided. The final renunciation (letting the drone go) carries cost, yet the emotional weight is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her needle pauses, her hum syncs with flame, her choice to guide rather than surrender the chart shows contradictory impulses in scene. Prince Kaelen’s shift from arrogance to sharp understanding is embodied in his changed gait. The cost—her continued exposure—remains felt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard’s nightly healing mirrors her own psychic fracture. The final renunciation—ceding the need to send the letters—lands with felt cost. Yet the estranged sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precise silence vs fragile faith—grounds every beat; the coral moment crystallizes motive and cost. PTSD as prison is embodied, not labeled. The final renunciation (old wound grafted with new meaning) is earned by the coral pattern and Kaito beat. Minor: “shrewdly innocent” stays verbal, never tripping a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for pure creation versus the weight of commissions—are embodied in her tactile handling of the fresco shard and the charged dust; her final choice to resurrect rather than invent is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the luminous graft of old to new.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity and “methodically playful” trait are embodied in tactile choices—angling the nickel, decoding the dome—yet her interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation (“traded certainty”) is earned but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “fierce and private thing” and the embodied tremor in her shaking hand—but the final beat leans on summary (“she poured in the memory…”) rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s insomnia and poetic vocation are vividly embodied—her barefoot sensitivity to soil-thrum, her lantern-lit postcard ritual—yet the “centuries of longing” reflex feels abstract, not lived. The decisive shift from chronicler to translator is motivated by the shell-song, but the interior contradiction between failure and vocation is told more than dramatized until the final carve. Still, her micro-choices (clutching the postcard, pressing ear to nacre, cutting words with shell) track a credible hierarchy of values and yield visible cost: she finally sleeps, surrendering her vigil. Enough specificity and earned change for high-band, but a hair shy of 9 because the longing backstory is asserted, not textured.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aeliana's "gently systematic" caretaker persona is embodied through humming and dusting, but the internal contradiction ("foxglove regret") remains largely poetic rather than dramatized in micro-choice. The crisis that compels the inhalation of the silver mist feels intuitive, the cost of breathing lost memory palpable. While her motivation stays pure and consistent, the tension of her loneliness vs. duty is implied not tested under pressure. Still, the final endurance carries felt renunciation: she pays by internalizing fading echoes and resumes alone.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—“careful exuberance”—is embodied through micro-choices: tilting the cracked inkwell, recognizing the sigil, feeling the personal stakes in her “heart hammering.” The renunciation of revenge and acceptance of silence as consequence create an earned endurance. Motivation is clear and rooted, tied to mentor-relationship stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Isla’s motives (preserve vs efficiency) remain specific and embodied; the trembling sigh and grime-track tear show cost. However, some interior moments glide to “life’s work” or “dappled resolve” labels that flatten contradiction—just shy of crisp contradictions in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her need to hide versus her need to transmit—are embodied in the meteorite ritual and the final release of Argos. The forged past and the real stone create a credible internal fracture that charges every micro-choice. The shift from self-protection to sacrificial transmission is earned and costly. Only the pigeon’s interiority is asserted rather than shown, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tracing the wood grain to decode the logbook is a precise, embodied micro-choice that reveals both intellect and grief. The contradiction between her slight frame and “tempered-steel” will is shown, not told, and it drives her to cross the final threshold. The only limit is that her father remains off-page; the relationship pressure is therefore abstract, capping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—charting unreachable stars while craving belonging—is embodied in micro-choices (bypassing sensors, activating beacon). The burnt feather reprise crystallizes her shift from sky to sea with visible cost: she forfeits the last relic of surface life to broadcast the deep’s rhythm. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Finn’s cheerful gloom is embodied in whistling amid despair, but interior contradiction is mostly summarized; the final choice to document the cataclysm is earned yet stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “calculated wilderness” and “vortex of probabilities” reveal a mind in motion. Motivation (serenading monotony) is dramatized through the micro-choice to trigger the bishop, not stated. The final renunciation—no bow, no money—earns a quiet cost: he forfeits recognition to preserve the illusion. Flawed perfectionist streak is visible but not fully compounded; still, the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between exile-as-punishment and exile-as-vantage crystallizes in the final beat. Motive (cosmic verse on skin) drives every micro-choice; pain anchors her in scene. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation of muted world is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—“stone and rings in his mind” carries motive and contradiction. The moment his motivation pivots from defeat to urgency is visible in his fingers picking up glass. One micro-choice (soldering not as connection but as “channeling light”) marks the shift and carries visible cost: the window is no longer illustration but instrument—stakes now bind artist and viewer.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cracked box under his thumb and the tooth/hair inside crystallize his contradictory impulses. The final resolve to speak his pain is earned by the prior accumulation of sensory memory and moral calculus. One minor slip: “bargained innocence” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her “lucidly watchful” stance shows in the way she studies the gauge and releases balloons. The contradiction between rational cartographer and intuitive dreamer is dramatized in the parallel-timeline beat, not merely asserted. The final choice to release the newly painted balloons is earned by the preceding epiphany and carries visible cost: her equation is now exposed, no longer private. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “curse” of perception is dramatized through the scream in the wall and the physical weight of the negative. The final choice—to testify rather than merely record—earns its cost from prior beats. One minor slip: “the weight of his legacy’s burden settled on her shoulders” edges toward label-speak before the embodied reaction rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse offered to the mirage is a concrete, costly micro-choice. The contradiction between her calm and the life-force sacrifice is dramatized in scene, not summarized. No stock labels or therapy-speak intrude. The earned stasis—return of the heartbeat and quiet disappearance—carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, the ash-choked cries she cannot forget, the “ledger of pain” she must balance. The contradiction between her need to act and her need to be still is dramatized in the moment she lifts the clipboard. The final choice—quiet notation instead of celebration—earns its cost through prior guilt and memory. One slip: the phrase “terrible price of redemption” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—opportunist vs secret sentimentalist—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices: caressing the egg, then releasing it. The final renunciation carries visible cost (loss of the egg and the identity it anchored) and is earned by the preceding realization that he is “its jailer.” Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. Flaws complicate choices rather than being balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority—“a sharp, cold thing within her”—grounds her motivation to reject a gilded fate; the bodily poetic is shown via deliberate micro-moves that cost her viscerally. Minor abstraction in “terrifying quiet of a blank page” edges diagnostic without eroding felt cost. Earned renunciation lands with a true smile.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—serenity vs. the need to dirty her art—drives every beat; the shift from ink to puppetry is embodied and costly. Her “uncommonly serene” trait visibly cracks when she hacks her own manuscripts, paying with the destruction of her identity. The final renunciation of pristine authorship is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    Silas’s transient rootedness and desire to honor overlooked histories are thematic banners, not embodied contradictions under pressure. His interiority is evocative but static; no internal conflict escalates toward the knot. The final stoic acceptance reads more as attunement than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s regret and vocation are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing holes, re-knotting rope); the final “snowmelt ardor” is earned by prior struggle and visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though the forgiveness backstory is slightly abstract. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Foresight’s interior contradiction—prediction vs. observation—drives every beat; the final renunciation of its directive is embodied in the snapped seal and the crystalline command. Emotions are rendered through sensor data and tactile cold rather than labels. The cost is the collapse of its entire purpose, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s frugality of observation versus surrender is embodied in micro-choices (tracing numbers, pressing tile, finally resting palm). Interior contradiction—logic vs felt mystery—drives the arc; the final renunciation costs her lifelong epistemic stance. No stock phrasing; emotion is embodied in warm stone, cool tile, and the hush between stars. The change is earned: her “endless wealth” is the inverse of her former scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s interiority shows contradictory impulses (pacifist vs manipulator) and embodied emotion under pressure; the final surrender of resentment is earned through prior causality and felt cost in Kael’s physical release, but one line edges too close to therapy-speech; strong but not perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her fear of losing sanity and her disciplined craft anchor every micro-choice. The synchronized-breathing pivot is earned by prior obsession and embodied cost. Minor: “firmly grounded” is asserted more than dramatized until the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rooted hurt vs. new openness—plays out in embodied micro-choices (crumpled decree, ribbon around apple). The final renunciation of the vow is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s bewilderment is embodied (shaking hands, locking the door) and her decisive micro-choice to press the shell to her temple launches the inciting beat. The internal conflict between archival duty and forbidden curiosity rotates on concrete action. Motivation survives the brief page length, though external behavior is mostly limited to one spatial leash.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is specific—his linguist’s toolkit guides every micro-choice; the final breath-negotiation crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Elara’s presence is thin but sufficient to pressure his stance. Motivation remains coherent, flaws acknowledged. No diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to keep Idris alive through story—are embodied in her micro-choices (clutching the swatch, reading aloud). The final renunciation of leaving the ship is earned and carries visible cost: she accepts eternal custodianship of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fingers on braids, seal held to light—yet the interior contradiction between fear and need for clarity is dramatized only once; the final smile feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelyn’s interiority is vivid—her fingertips “listen,” her will “coaxes”—and her motivation (restore the caves’ quiet) is embodied in every micro-choice. The final kneel and recognition of silence as “shape of aftermath” earns a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s stubborn wish—“prove that coincidences have meaning”—roots every action; her interiority is tactile (fingers chilled on metal, shard humming in mind) and contradictory (lonely yet compelled). Micro-choices (picking the prism shard, charting night after night) show a hierarchy of values where hope outranks safety. The final stance—quietly sending the beacon rather than shouting—is an earned renunciation scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her heart a drum against the silence”), but the final self-conjecture arrives more as epiphany than earned contradiction; no prior beat shows her doubting the archive’s purpose, so the renunciation feels slightly unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sparrow’s interiority is vivid—his fingers worrying the kerosene rag, the chemical chant—yet the shift from passive observer to active catalyst is slightly under-motivated; the mosaic “RISE” sparks him, but we don’t feel the prior despair in his body. The final renunciation (walking away) is earned, but the cost is more communal than personal, softening the sting.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ayla's interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet fleeing conflict—is embodied in her tactile attention to tide-pools and the cicada. The micro-choice to return with the object reconfigures the relationship under pressure, earning the softened détente. Kael’s single line of dialogue carries the cost of remembered vulnerability, making the shift legible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia drives every early choice; her decisive act of surrendering the doll at the climax manifests a visible, embodied shift from terror to beatific acceptance. One deduction for summarizing her new understanding too neatly instead of dramatizing the contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers closing around the cool vial, the practiced leverage of the oar. Motivation (“teach silence how to comfort”) is dramatized through micro-choices: steering toward the arch, striking the gondola, watching the old woman unclench. The final smile is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral; a sharper personal forfeiture would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen's interiority balances nostalgia with resolve, and the orchard fruit choice crystallizes his arc. Missing deeper contradictory impulse under peak stress caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—guardian of absence yet compelled to teach—surface in the micro-choice to stop the youth from knocking; the mirrored scars beat embodies interior conflict without therapy-speak. Motivation remains consistent: isolation as mercy. The final dissolve into starlight is an earned renunciation whose cost (permanent solitude) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s survivor-cynicism and “poke the bear” streak are embodied in every micro-choice; the refusal to offer herself and the pivot to the bolt feel earned. Interior contradiction (“virtuously mischievous” vs trauma) is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is visible in the sliced sleeve and the diamond she must now live with. Only the grandmother whisper feels slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysander’s contradictory silence—both listener and destroyer—is embodied in every measured gesture, the crank’s resistance a felt extension of his flaw. Interior conflict crystalizes in the moment he neither speeds nor halts the handle under the grandfather’s appalling confession, yet the slight reserve toward high band stems from limited on-page choice variety within the compressed scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The interiority is specific—"a man unburdened," the tremor as he unsnaps his armor—to the withdrawal. Motive (finding future beyond guilt) is dramatized by the moment he frees the marionette; the embodied cost is visible when the weight of armor literally drops. One slight hedge: the phrase "shape of possibility itself" flirts with abstraction but is anchored by the visual marionette sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the shift from penance to purpose is earned through the tactile encounter with the button and letter. The contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope—co-exist in scene, not summary. Micro-choice to scan button and letter together visibly costs him his prior stance of detachment. No on-page second character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s understated cultivation of “deliberate carelessness” and the embodied chill of “cold damp seeping through his jacket” give credible interiority. The grandfather-key backstory is anchored in one tactile cue and tilts his present choice. Final stance—“a whisper in the static”—earns its cost by the prior accumulation of risk. Minor slip: the emotional pivot at the lagoon drifts toward abstract resolve rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers move by touch, sweat from concentration, fatigue after the final note. The inherited duty and eerie nostalgia create a layered motive that intensifies through the ritual. The cost is palpable in her slumped shoulders and the bittersweet silence. Only the grandmother memory is slightly summary, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aisling’s quiet obsession with leaf-messages is embodied in tactile seed-sorting rituals and the micro-choice to honor a speck; her interiority stays concrete. The final transformation feels earned because her reverence for forgotten things triggers the Arbor’s awakening, costing her prior anonymity. Yet the shift from “secret” to “living librarian” is compressed into a single beat, blurring the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s paradox—the “uncertainly certain” stance—embodies the internal contradiction required; her micro-choice to buy on the third Sunday and her ultimate improvisation under the waterfall dramatize a credible shift. Yet the grandfather line slips in as backstory and the greenhouse vendor glides like stock archetype (“eyes like cracked porcelain”), nudging her from a full 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs. hope—drives every beat; the embodied shift from “failure” to “mending” is earned through micro-choices (kneeling, coin offer). Leo’s terror-to-strength arc is credible and specific. Only the boy’s voice lacks full individuation, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “modestly fearless heart” is embodied in the steady way she coaxes Kael rather than declaring courage. The crocodile-tooth beat crystallizes her value hierarchy: she risks exposing her method to prove Kael’s courage was real. Kael’s shame and remembered laughter are rendered through embodied flickers and surges, not labels. Only the brief “theory she desperately hoped to prove” skirts diagnostic self-awareness, keeping the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Contradictory need (quantify mercy) + physical compulsion collide; final disengaging of strap is embodiment of mercy enacted. Cost paid in pain & defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied; her trembling hands and the “solid anchor in the fluid sea” crystallize cost. The grandmother’s role is off-stage, so relationship pressure is absent, but Elara’s self-contradiction—yearning to remember yet fearing what she’ll find—drives every beat. The final renunciation (to continue the work) is earned by the revealed weight of the pages.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. private compulsion to “see what ceilings hide”—is embodied in the moment he drags the desk and chooses to speak to the ghost. The cost (breaking his lifelong rule of non-engagement) is felt in the single line “For the first time, Leo chose to engage.” Flaw and competence are balanced; the ghost’s pressure forces a micro-choice that reconfigures his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s monomaniacal drive is embodied in ink-stained hands and steady lever-pull; the interior contradiction—perfection versus rupture—plays out in real time. The final smile and reach for the roller show earned acceptance of imperfection with visible cost (the vanished frost). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation remains singular and intensifies to the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s solitary grief and poetic compulsion are embodied in every gesture—covering mirrors, cradling the shard—so interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (solitary victory) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: “sole citizen… grieving heir.” No contradictory impulses on stage, yet the arc feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s vocation and inherited burden are vividly embodied; the stone-chip allergy to lies forces immediate visceral stakes. His final act—tethering melody to chamber—grows credibly from lifelong craft and moral compass. Silas’s betrayal supplies external pressure, but Elian’s internal contradiction (maker vs. destroyer of stability) remains underplayed. Cost is felt in bodily wilting and the irreversible flood of light.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s compulsion is vivid yet the inner contradictions that would sharpen end-pressure remain muted; his embodied awe arrives, but the absence of a felt flaw or risk that costs him something tangible at the plunge keeps the full charge just shy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sculptor’s eye reframes geology as intention—but the “perpetually learning” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final carve. The blank slide gift hints at future cost yet lacks immediate contradiction or embodied price. Still, her micro-choices under the arch feel inevitable and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her fixation on night-blooming flowers is dramatized through tactile work and postcard handling. The final shift from loneliness to gratitude is earned by the cathedral epiphany and postcard re-reading. One minor slip: “quietly driven intensity” is label-speak that could be shown earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s shift from archivist to rescuer is embodied in the micro-choice to spell “WHO ARE YOU?” in shells; her contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. moral obligation—collide in that act. The cost is the irreversible knowledge of Kenneth’s murder, felt as weight in her “solemn heart, ascending.” Interiority stays concrete: “grit of sand in a different time,” no diagnostic labels. Motivation intensifies cleanly from archival duty to personal covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her rejection of “false comfort” is embodied in the obsessive, tactile handling of the bottle and the deliberate act of reading memories aloud. The contradiction between her grand ambition and the town’s absolute emptiness is dramatized through micro-choices (walking the streets, hanging lanterns, piling journals). The final stance—choosing memory over wishing—earns a visible cost: she is “deserted no more,” yet the people remain absent; the town’s spirit is resurrected, not its bodies. Flaw: the moment of realization (“the bottle was not a container, but a catalyst”) is slightly over-articulated, blunting the embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her trembling hands, the chalk-dust memory, the contradiction between oath and survival all feel lived. The final paralysis is credible and costly. One minor slip: “velvet disquiet” drifts toward label-speak rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s shift from passive preservation to active restoration is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, planting, guiding the vortex—each action tethered to a visible cost (the phoenix’s vanishing, the acorn’s blaze). Interiority stays concrete: “texture of borrowed time” felt as bark, not abstraction. Motivation crystallizes through sensory memory, not exposition. The final renunciation—he stays, the tree leaves—earns its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s credibly curious trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—fusing wire to rope, resisting the brass lever—culminating in a renunciation that costs her the safety of easy alarm. Interiority is embodied (“the silence into her very bones”) rather than labeled. The final hand on the still rope crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid—"silent, burning joy of a million small journeys" anchors empathy—but motivations shift from curiosity to mystical compulsion without friction visible on the page, slightly flattening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “tranquilly perceptive” nature is dramatized through micro-choices like leaving water for the farmer-ghost. The final renunciation (accepting lifelong silence as caretaker) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the woman-ghost’s urgency is slightly abstract, muting the stakes of her plea.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; Leo’s tactile obsession with the shard contradictorily fuses loss and hope. The final recognition beat hinges on his prior actions and shared frailty, achieving Earned Stasis that forecloses the path of solitary time-keeping. No therapy-speak or stock traits mar the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her reverent handling of the feather and deliberate tending of the kite reveal a consistent, character-specific ethic. The final renunciation—leaving the transformed artifact—carries visible cost (she relinquishes the rare feather) and is earned by prior causality. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—defying death by inviting in death-like stone—is subtly rendered through micro-choices (wrapping copper, feeling stone breathe). The final stance crystallizes with lived cost (orchard remodeled beyond her lifespan), although we lose tactile interiority after the pivotal touch.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skeptical drive is embodied in every micro-choice—measuring, resisting, then re-calibrating after the amber anomaly. The shift from data-hunger to acceptance of ineffable release is earned through the walk itself, not stated. Cost is visible: she abandons the safety of pure skepticism. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elros's interiority is richly embodied—grief in clenched fingers on seed pods, relief in the “faint, rustling click.” Motivation (garden over graves) stays taut, and the renunciation of violence carries embodied cost; the single moment of speaking ghosts into soil reconfigures his vow.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's longing for Elara pulses through every choice—from risking the leaflet search to pressing static into meaning—earning steadfast endurance and a final act that freezes the world in a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from nostalgic paralysis to active cartographer is earned through the compass-glint beat. The contradiction between exile and privilege is dramatized in micro-choices (drawing remembered skies vs. mapping the nebula). Cost is felt: he forfeits the comfort of memory for the risk of the unknown. Minor slip: “confusion into exploration” is stated rather than fully embodied until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s chivalrous code is dramatized through the climactic trade of his most prized memory; the contradiction between thiefly skill and ethical restraint is embodied in the moment he relinquishes the fox. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The cost—loss of sentimental anchor—lands on the page and reconfigures his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s internal split—historian of tiny gestures vs. active saviour—is dramatised in one silent beat inside the gallery; the coat hand-off carries visible cost and crystallises a clamp on her future rest. yet the soldier disappears too fast to test relationship status, muting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s nightly suffering, tactile anchor, and culminating acceptance are embodied and particular; the drive to "understand the shape of home" is dramatized via the feather and stone. Endurance without external interaction keeps the performance just short of 9-band crucible effects.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—guilt versus the need to act—remains embodied in the fidgeting hands and the tapestry decoding; the final placement of the labyrinth crystallizes his earned absolution with visible cost (the empty plinth, resumed life without him). Reflection blocks are concise and tilt present tactics. Only the prince’s death is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—fear vs. defiance—is embodied in the forehead-to-bone gesture and pigment-stained hands; the final stance crystallizes with visible communal cost. Motive progression from “paint instead of confess” to “invite polyphony” is causally earned. Minor slip: the crowd’s collective turn feels slightly choral rather than individually pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her held breath, trembling hand, and slumped posture all under pressure. The contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to testify) coexist in-scene. The final act of embedding the charm is fully earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Only a trace of diagnostic self-awareness (“she was no longer uncertain”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for the past yet immobilized by it—drives every beat; the shell re-ignites a buried want, forcing a visible renunciation of the quay. Embodied emotion (“paint still vibrant…warm in his hand”) grounds the epiphany. Micro-choice to leave the shell anchors the cost: he forfeits the safety of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet desperation is embodied in tactile micro-choices (hand on curved wall, vial trembling) and his interior contradiction—yearning to be heard yet refusing to shout—drives every beat. The final kneel and empty vial crystallize a renunciation that costs him certainty, earning the closure. Minor slip: “boy really” leans label, not earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the pain was a fuel”), her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. let go) act simultaneously in scene, and her final renunciation—choosing to stay and die after sending the archive—carries visible cost. The bronze censer foot anchors memory and choice, but the voice drifts toward abstract “geography of loss” phrasing that edges into label-speak, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rational forager vs. desperate empath—are embodied in the orchard beats; her involuntary truth-telling forces a public confession of doubt that tightens the cost of using the eye. The final choice to wield the relic as a trowel, not a crutch, is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible psychic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “curator of absence” stance and habit of reading gaps are specific and embodied. The borrowed-memory conceit is dramatized through sensory bleed (“second skin”), not summary. Final transfer of the flower to the woman crystallizes his role as witness with visible cost: he relinquishes the quest-object. Minor slip: the woman’s arrival feels slightly convenient, muting the flaw-driven mistake requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s loneliness and intuitive gift are embodied through tactile micro-choices (ink pad, ant trail) that escalate to the climactic self-recognition; the final renunciation of external rescue in favor of internal vocation carries visible emotional cost. Interiority stays specific and sensorial, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a brief “she had always been on one” summary that edges toward epiphany shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Isolde’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her climb and surrender to the starlight are micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The shift from disenchantment to cosmic connection is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyra’s interior conflict—control vs organic flow—is rooted in her craft and embodied in the flickering star; the contradictory impulses resolve into earned stasis as she abandons containment for guided growth. Micro-choice (tracing the spiral, adjusting emissions) aligns motive with action; the visible cost (hollow flicker to resonant glow) crystallizes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for narrative order yet recoiling from the chaos she’s bottled—are embodied in her trembling hand on the scroll and the visceral jealousy of her past selves. The final renunciation of “distilling” in favor of “carrying” chaos is earned by the flight and the altitude-burned jealousy. Micro-choices (snapping the scroll shut, spreading arms to soar) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s scent‐loss and watchmaker friendship ring authentic; the interior contradiction between her need to heal and her inability to feel is embodied in the Birthing Screw beat. The moment when she stills the baby is earned by prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the crystallization reflex externalizes fear without label-speak. Motivation (transform scar into story) drives every beat and culminates in a visible cost—her arm’s amber lattice. The micro-choice to hold breath reframes childhood superstition into mature technique, earning the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt-driven apology is embodied in the perfume bottle and the induced-current ritual; her interior contradiction—professional pride vs. remorse—plays out in real time. Finch’s ghost is sketched with economical gesture that still reveals his obsessive artistry. The micro-choice to uncork the bottle rather than begin with banishment shows her shift from spectacle to restitution. Cost is felt when the apology is accepted yet cannot undo the sawing of the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“resounding hush so profound it felt like a physical presence”), but the Witness’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs him until the final spiral walk, so the change feels lightly earned rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her ear to brass, sweat wiped, panic forced down. Motivation (“to understand what clocks really measure”) is stated early and re-priced at closure. Micro-choices under pressure (counting primes, feather-light spring tweaks) reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the key’s necessity carries visible cost and earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thumb on the button, the grief mapped as non-Euclidean space—but the “physics of letting go” is stated more than dramatized until the final beat, keeping the contradiction from fully igniting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s compulsive drive to "read" her father into the clue trail reads as organic lineage of obsession—interiority is precise (“the mica fractured the flame into a hundred shards of light and shadow”). Every micro-choice (catching the subway token, reading the scribbled equations) tightens the stake toward understanding. Her Earned Stasis—weeping in the library with his last line in hand—pays the cost with visible grief. No slips toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s motivation—teaching endings how to begin—remains abstract; his interiority is poetic but not contradictory under pressure. The glass disc acts as an externalized conscience, yet Silas’s micro-choices feel predetermined rather than wrestled with. The final “satisfying click” is earned by ritual repetition, not by a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelin’s interiority is precise—her “calibrated instrument of preservation” heart and blue-black fingers embody vocation. The moment she silently offers the locket to the grown son crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes the artifact she was charged to archive. Secondary character appears only at the end, yet the mother’s recorded voice exerts live pressure. One minor slip: “haunted euphoria” is named rather than fully embodied in body.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s loneliness-cure motive is vivid and embodied; his “desperately jocular” laugh is a lived tic that costs him authenticity. Clara’s grief is shown through gesture (soil-stained knees, quiet eyes) and her smile’s return feels earned. The micro-choice—offering curatorship—turns both characters’ stakes and is rooted in prior reciprocity. One slip: Clara’s interiority is filtered rather than dramatized, keeping her just shy of full individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—his skin “drinking languages” and the compass ring’s warmth anchor motive. The final absorption beat crystallizes a credible renunciation: he chooses to carry the map inside rather than draw it, a visible cost. Minor slip: the “quiet blaze” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the embodied fire in his chest rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (confidence in uncertainty vs. panic at Kappa-7’s noise) play out in micro-choices like scratching ones and zeroes or smearing blood. The final renunciation—accepting the anomaly as the signal—earns its cost through prior failed calibrations. One slip: “confidently uncertain” is stated more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “joyful sorrow” is embodied in the camera’s weight and the pier’s creak—but the whispering-advisor past is ornamental, never complicating her present tactics. The final renunciation (conducting silence instead of mapping it) is earned and costly, yet the absence of any second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rescue vs. conceal—are dramatized through micro-choices (erasing her own trail) with visible cost; the final renunciation is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—compliance masking rebellion—drives every micro-choice; her drumming is both therapy and sabotage, and the moment her hand passes through Kael’s form crystallizes the cost of their entanglement. The shared memory fracture is embodied, not labeled. Motivation remains character-bound and intensifies to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile worry over the coin, her gait tuned for stealth—but the Port Master’s sudden comprehension feels slightly granted rather than wrested from embodied cost. The antique key’s meaning is asserted more than dramatized, muting the final micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “spiralingly calm” trait is embodied in micro-choices like opening shutters with “infinite patience.” Motivation (teach darkness the value of stars) is dramatized when she shifts from reflecting sunlight to weaving starlight, showing cost in the faint dying light. The flaw of silent isolation is accepted rather than cured, creating Earned Stasis. Minor: her empathy remains more asserted than contradicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mr. Aris’s quiet revolution is credibly rooted in his role as listener-of-fears and curator-of-stillness; the choice to plant blue stones rather than fists arises from a specific internal contradiction between mercy and outrage. His hush-breathing body language matches his profession, while the moment he kneels to cradle Elara crystallizes both self-consolation and tactical commitment. The felt cost—surrendering anonymity, risking exposure—pays for the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “quiet rebellion” in dock labor and the “mental severing” as he rows are embodied and specific. The longing unlocked by the scrimshaw and the bone-deep whale-call create credible, contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of the old world carries visible cost: he drops the map-scrimshaw and turns his back on Aethelburgh. Minor: the “combative tenderness” label is slightly diagnostic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied in the slow, tactile ritual of whittling and the flat narration of mundane tasks; the contradictory impulses—grief-numbness versus sudden protectiveness—are dramatized when the lavender falls. The final shift from carving to weaving the bird is earned by the prior accumulation of silence and loss, and the cost (accepting fragility over control) is visible on the page. Minor slip: the “morally ambiguous” label is asserted rather than fully enacted in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to dissolve boundaries yet fearing the old failure—is embodied in her trembling hand and held breath; the final fusion costs her former identity as mere translator, a renunciation legible in her silent departure. Motivation remains rooted and intensifies through each micro-choice: she does not touch the colonnade but lets it permeate her, a progression from observer to conduit. The flaw—her prior literalism—drives the mistake that exile punished, and its confrontation charges the climax. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—yearning for beauty while disdaining color—remains vivid and embodied. Her surrender of perspective as payment roots the final shift in a visible cost, earning the earned stasis. Yet the reciprocal transformation of Elara feels slightly external, tempering a full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory need for both control and vulnerability is embodied in the shift from “playing the notes” to “questioning them.” The carbide-lens micro-choice crystallizes her re-prioritization, and the final bell-tone costs her the safety of distance. Motivation remains singular and intensifies to the climax. Minor: the child-laughter reveal edges toward convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from “closed tomb” to “gardener of meaning” is earned through the telescope vision. The micro-choice to place the stencil and look is decisive, with visible cost (accepting grief as fertile soil). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity anchors every beat, but interior contradictions are announced rather than dramatized; the impulse to confide gains force only after she sees Gable’s fear. Gable’s shift from bragging to vulnerability is sketched economically and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scholarly hunger vs. colossal emotional cost—drive every beat; the climax choice to refuse transcendence is credibly earned and pinned to prior causality through the Echo-sight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s observer-archivist persona is sharply drawn through tactile micro-choices, but the “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” trait stays ornamental until late; her ultimate decision to quarantine the dream earns the closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s trembling hands, deliberate soil-work, and final calm exhale embody contradictory impulses—rage and compassion—in concrete micro-choices. The interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, the shed tail-tip and shifting chameleon act as embodied mirrors of his evolving stance. The arc earns its renunciation: he will be “more careful, but not cease to be gentle,” a stance foreclosed with visible cost—the shattered trust cannot be restored, only integrated. The only minor drag is a brief explanatory pulse (“he realized”) that slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aveline’s contradictory impulse—seeking closure yet compelled to reopen wounds—drives every beat, from the ivy’s memory to the bandage choice. Interiority is embodied (phantom limb, throb, shaking) and never diagnostic. The final micro-choice to unwrap the bandage is earned by the tunneling revelation and carries visible cost (pain + knowledge). One slip: the “closure seeker” label is voiced once, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her tactile film-threading and spatial imagination drive every beat. The projectionist’s archived love is rendered through her perceptual lens, not exposition. A clear renunciation—she chooses projection over possession—costs her the private keepsake and completes her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s yearning is vivid and embodied, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the single on-page choice (assembling the nocturlabe) is well-motivated yet the cost is diffuse—exhaustion rather than a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—guardian who won’t sleep versus tender cultivator—plays vibrantly through micro-choices (hand on clock, coaxing the scream). Final renunciation of violence in favor of harmonic charm earns Ended Stasis with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “bones” hum, his fingers “trace perfect teeth”—but the final renunciation of the gear feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (empty hand) yet the prior beat doesn’t fully dramatize the gear’s emotional weight. Still, the contradictory impulses (stray vs. belonging) play out in scene and the earned stasis lands.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior arc from fearful inertia to self-validated courage is embodied in tactile beats (hand stamped, step onto boat). Motivation is consistent, but the guides remain archetypal observers rather than crucible agents, so relationship pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leo’s silence isn’t a gimmick: it forces interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and a final martyrdom-smile that locks renunciation with cost; the stalled throat nerve is dramatized through choice, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aetos’s quiet scholar-warrior duality is embodied in every micro-choice—moistening the pellet, tracing glyphs, channeling force—yet the interior contradiction (crusher of stone vs. tender scholar) never collides in a single beat; the final renunciation is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tidal tapping, the “quiet anchor in her chest,” the way her fingers “sync to the sea.” Motivation is consistent and intensifies to the final beat. The only gap is that the moment of decision to leave the station is summarized rather than dramatized, so the cost is felt but not fully earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s barefoot stargazer identity is embodied through tactile detail and micro-choices; the “awkwardly confident” trait manifests in her hesitant step yet absolute purpose. Interiority is specific and embodied, culminating in the final conduit moment. The cost—her body as lightning rod—lands as felt consequence. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s quiet insurgency and plant-telepathy are vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. evolution) play out in the tactile moment of unsealing. The final choice to plant “seeds” rather than shout is earned and carries felt cost. Minor: her interiority flirts with diagnostic self-label (“insurgent grandmother”) once, but recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s embodied trauma response and micro-choices under pressure are sharply realized; the photograph’s shift from anchor to stone is a vivid interior contradiction. Motivation—proving growth over scars—drives every beat. The final act of flattening the photo under a river stone is a credible renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is painterly and sensorial, aligning with Elara’s profession; her contradictory motives—flee the closing walls yet descend willingly—are dramatized through concrete choices. The choice to “let go” the sorrow-thread and “follow” the purpose-thread crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible foreclosure. Cost is felt when the mercury is gone, the box empty. No diagnostic label-speak; thought degrades under pressure appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Characterization is precise through "albino tracker with pink-rimmed eyes" and tactile patience, yet Silas’ emotional arc leans toward intellectual epiphany rather than internal contradiction; the serene anger does not visibly fracture under pressure and the micro-choice to pour water is more discovery than sacrifice. The Earned Stasis lands gently, but the felt cost is soft because the anger disappears rather than being paid. Still, specific sensory embodiment and distinct priorities earn high mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s interiority (“hands trembling”, “dizzying quiet”) is viscerally embodied; contradiction vault vs letter tightens to one irreversible broadcast. The moment her fingers bypass security feels earned because previous pages establish her solitary obedience. Cost crystallizes when she exhales and walks back into “humming truths,” knowing every step is forever changed. No head-hopping or diagnostic self-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserve peace vs. confront truth—are dramatized through the ritual and the final decision to carry the chip; the embodied cost is the tremor that threatens her “perfect world.” Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic. The jacket and sandbag scrap anchor her inherited identity without exposition overload. Closure choice is earned and forecloses hiding.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nereus’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—still hands, measured breaths—yet the interior contradiction (yearning vs. stoicism) stays implicit. The final renunciation—accepting the goddess’s grief into his own chest—carries visible cost and is earned by prior harmonic discipline. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (goddess backstory) is brief and cues present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Viola’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the pen-nib totem and proof-by-contradiction tactic reveal her logician’s mind under pressure. The final choice—to write a dull corrective column—earns its cost by the prior causal chain and the father-haunted legacy. Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied in the amber and the ghost-voice; her micro-choice to braid rather than erase the memory is earned and costly. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. The final silence is a felt renunciation, not a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—whimsy vs. despair—play out in the tactile act of sweeping sand and pressing the tile. The final renunciation (scattering the mandala) is earned by the sonic epiphany and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the philosopher’s pressure is more thematic foil than crucible, so relationship dynamics remain under-used.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clarity of motivation (quiet, desperate craving for gentler ethics); embodied contradictions in motion vs retrocognitive paralysis trade cost; choice-driven internal cost; “steel cradling fragile tessera” anchors stance change. One minor slip—single voiced diagnosis line (offer “not panic, choice”) abstracts peak beat, slightly undercuts earned embodiment; otherwise strong interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic memory shards, the coin’s warmth, the aria’s silver ribbons—yet the “artist demands an encore” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to complicate her resolve. The final peace feels earned, but the cost is diffuse rather than embodied in a single, visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief and skepticism root every micro-choice; the loss of tactile memory is embodied viscerally and the retrieval is felt, not told. Yet the pill-induced leap from derision to instant belief strains against previous skepticism without the dramatized friction that would ground such a pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a buoyancy born from overwhelming, ancient wonder”), but the shift from observer to vessel is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“to provide the medium”) is credible yet feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Turnkey’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, “quietly inspired” mind turning pebbles—but contradictory impulses remain off-stage; the shift from passive acceptance to active cataloging is asserted rather than dramatized. Cost is felt in the obsidian drop, yet the prior beats lack micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. Motivation is clear, but agency is more summary than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-loathing versus the need to matter—are embodied in the pillbox ritual and the choice to vouchsafe. The burned face as credential is a sharp status lever with the runner. Final renunciation of ghosthood is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is textured and embodied—his “closely attentive nature” is dramatized through micro-choices like the deliberate stitch of blue thread. The oath to wait until the gutters stop is a credible, character-rooted motive that forecloses departure and carries felt cost in the final silence. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her tactile engagement with clay and glass anchors her motives. The shift from passive observer to active steward is earned through compassionate micro-choices that visibly cost her time and safety. Contradictory impulses—detachment versus caretaking—play simultaneously in scene. Final renunciation of mere curiosity for guardianship forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the lockmaster’s gauge as inherited trowel anchors motive and micro-choices. The “wistfully pragmatic” stance is dramatized through the aeration ritual and mirror-lighting, not stated. A credible renunciation (the petal’s end → new blooming) closes the arc with felt cost. Minor slip: Mr. Gable’s and Mrs. Lin’s interior shifts are inferred rather than embodied, keeping score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—preserve memory yet escape its weight—grounds every beat; the shift from brittle isolation to reconciled solitude is embodied in her tremor before the stone circle and the softening of her stance when the ghosts appear. Micro-choice of placing the sundial crystallizes the arc with visible cost: she forfeits the fantasy of erasure for the burden of coexistence. Interiority stays specific, never lapsing into label-speak. One character only, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s desire to “find the thread” becomes concrete interiority—paper, nest, studio work—yet the leap from vague quest to specific installation is more a lyrical epiphany than a friction-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s “cautiously hopeful” skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—cross-referencing charts, repurposing the array—culminating in the deliberate broadcast that costs her professional integrity. The contradiction between wonder and suspicion is dramatized, not labeled, and the final slump shows earned fatigue. Leo is functional but thin; his single beat of discovery serves the plot more than relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is embodied and put under acute pressure, driving every tactical beat; her precise, fearful pragmatism feels lived-in and culminates in earned reclamation of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellis’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied in tactile micro-choices (cataloguing features, thumb on ribbon). The pivot from clinical puzzle to empathetic awakening is dramatized through the shift in line quality and the ribbon’s re-weighting. Cost is felt: he forfeits his clinical detachment and accepts the emotional risk of “meeting” the victim. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-cooked in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s librarian precision and trembling hands give her a tactile interiority; the ancestor’s quiet defiance is mirrored in her own micro-choice to pull the nail, costing her inherited dread and gaining custodianship. The shift from “nervously confident” to resolved lands with felt weight. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—built on “never” yet seized by “furious spark”—is embodied in trembling hands and micro-choice of angling the glass. The shift from courier to participant is earned through his observant trait activating the map, paying the cost of leaving the valley. Only the fiddler’s brief appearance keeps relationship pressure light; still, Elias’s arc is complete and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ash’s interiority is embodied (“hollow inheritance,” “turbulent searching”) and his final micro-choice—closing the satchel—forecloses the circular path with visible cost. The old man’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters Ash’s stance. Motivation is consistent and intensifies to the renunciation. Minor: the “polished calm” label is echoed rather than dramatized in Ash.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is embodied in the “sharp stone in her gut” and the “mantle of leaden stars.” The contradiction between her gift to heal others and her inability to heal herself is dramatized in the present choice to write the star-story. The final act of writing is earned by the dream revelation and carries visible cost: she must shoulder the burden she has decoded.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guarded nature shapes every choice: her refusal to bargain with the seed, the embodied contradiction in holding pain without yielding. Interiority remains tactile—burning seed, numbed hand—and the final renunciation is earned through prior causality and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—scars, root-tether, and dread/hope duality all embodied—but the final “anchor” beat feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not viscerally paid on the page, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s relentless idealism vs emptiness crystallizes memorably; the bartered-memory choice shows direct embodied cost. Interiority vivid, never diagnostic. Flaw drives stakes and forecloses sun-bright future.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—shame-driven retreat vs. the need to matter—are embodied in the tactile inventory of the grille cloth and the tremor when he opens the case. The final resolve is earned because the letters force him to confront the cost of insulating himself with facts. Minor slip: “confidently uncertain” is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s grief-driven need to decode transition physics is clear and embodied; the micro-choice to release the seed crystallizes his shift from control to acceptance. Interiority is specific, though the “kindly methodical” trait is more asserted than tested. The cost—surrender of certainty—lands quietly but tangibly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Librarian’s serene, ritualized caretaking and Elian’s tremulous acceptance both feel embodied; the moment Elian “shuddered, tears tracing lines” crystallizes contradictory grief/joy without label-speak. Motivation (“preserve wonder in routine”) is dramatized through the meticulous handling of the creel and the tidal pause. The final stance—Elian expanded, not erased—earns its cost on the page. Minor: Librarian’s interiority is more archetype than idiosyncrasy, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the pearl’s sensory memory beat crystallizes her shift from collector to conduit. The final micro-choice—handing the pearl over without words—earns the closure cost. Minor slip: “walled off by years of walking through tombs of paranoia” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (seeking truth vs embracing failure) remain active scene-by-scene, and her renunciation of “paper maps” for embodied walking earns the forgiveness quest with visible cost—leaving the station with only the uncertain trail ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s compulsion to find “the library of unspoken words” is dramatized through her decision to lift the veil and claim guardianship; interiority remains specific and tied to every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet, thrumming” motive and the embodied “mulberry ache” anchor her. The final renunciation is earned: she chooses the networked grief over preservation, paying with her safety. One slip: the telepathy trait is asserted rather than dramatized until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s single-minded pursuit to “capture one last spark” shapes every beat, aligning action with motive; however, the geomancer remains a passive subject, not a crucible, so relational pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied; the shift from seeking peace to accepting every perspective is dramatized through micro-choices (pinning the hairpin, re-stirring the pool with ancestral memory). The final forgiveness of herself lands with visible emotional cost. Minor: the sister’s betrayal is only summarized, not staged, so the relational crucible is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—professional mask vs. nascent conscience—drives the final refusal; the embodied shift from “sincerely insincere smile” to “protected vulnerability” is credible and costly. Client’s flicker of doubt supplies external pressure, but his arc is sketched rather than dramatized, limiting relationship crucible impact. Mirror shard’s fall registers as forfeiture, sealing the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—teaching vanishing to reveal presence—anchors every beat; her withheld age and luminous reversal crystallize the cost of her stance. Kaelen’s micro-choice to follow the third ripple is credibly embodied. The final image of both glowing reconfigures their relationship under pressure. Only the “living lie” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zephyr’s quiet obsession is embodied in her daily ritual and the final climb; the contradiction between stillness and necessary motion is dramatized, not stated. Interiority is concrete (“her muscles trembling”) and the cost—abandoning her lifelong stillness—is felt on the page. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets are waived. The earned renunciation of her original goal lands with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while mechanically unstrapping—grounds her arc; the embodied shiver and breathless collapse after mist-craft show cost. Motivation (“find the sacred in the simple”) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation of the spire is earned. Minor slip: “underachieving” is asserted rather than shown in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s obsession with “the color of sound” is vivid and embodied; the glass-bell memory anchors motive. His dive sequence shows micro-choices under pressure (securing lantern, wading, three dives) that escalate risk. The final realization reweights his lifelong quest with felt cost—he abandons the search for a perfect note and accepts a luminous substitute. Interiority stays concrete, though a touch more contradiction mid-dive could sharpen the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alaric’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt—drives every micro-choice; the obsidian shard biting his palm embodies the cost of renouncing the coin of peace. Motive remains consistent yet intensifies under pressure, earning the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper’s interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (tracing grooves, holding vellum aloft) and a clear, escalating motive—turning nameless fear into named love—that culminates in a costly crystallizing act. The contradictory pull between duty and yearning is dramatized, not stated. Micro-choices (listening, carrying, whispering) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final transformation of heartbreak into “something he could hold” is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s brittle devotion is embodied in trembling hands and a “glass carefully blown but never properly annealed,” and the micro-choice to sync his breath to the metronomic drip visibly costs him exhaustion; the final kneel seals an earned stasis. Interiority is specific—his power “fizzled like a damp wick”—and the contradiction between naive certainty and creeping despair is held in scene, not summarized. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw of tepid talent directly shapes the drip-by-drip tactic, making the resolution credible.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—keeper vs. citizen—drives the final reversal; embodied emotion in the sip and shrine placement shows cost. Motivation shifts from erasure to witness with felt consequence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. sentiment—drives every beat; the micro-choice to paint the flame instead of fight is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of pure detachment). The grandmother memory is brief, anchored to present cue, and tilts her stance. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her hands flew… frantic energy”), motives escalate from duty to personal loyalty, and the final pull of the lever carries earned cost. The contradictory pull between isolation and responsibility is dramatized, not labeled. Only the mentor remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—yearning for wholeness while clinging to numbness—are dramatized in the micro-choice to fuse joy with grief; the embodied cost of each memory-pair vivifies the brain and visibly drains him. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the final integration feels earned because every prior beat forced a felt trade-off. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    A consistent interior Elara anchors choices; "Safeguard space for innovation" remains a taut motive that threads every action. Her tactile burial of the seed and the final stance before the brook both embody the promised vigil. The flaw—quiet complicity in legal gamesmanship—is allowed without apology, giving her a credible edge of cost. A clearer trace of contradictory impulse mid-scene would have tightened the inner arc to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s grief-rooted motive is embodied in every micro-choice; the leaf-blower-as-orchestra is specific and character-revealing. Interior contradiction—violent tenderness—drives each sonic gesture. The final walk toward his wife’s laugh earns the shift from isolation to shared tending with visible cost (voice gone, fuel spent).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for home vs. duty to guard—drives every beat; the pendant’s warmth and final coldness embody her shift from feral exile to conversant guardian. Micro-choice to “push the concept of the garden’s heart” against the seam is specific, embodied, and costly (pendant consumed). Homesickness remains palpable yet is sublimated into earned stasis. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stoically-sensitive Alder crystallizes before us through each refusal to mend; the interior contradiction—granite patience over roiling revulsion—shapes every micro-choice. His embodied impulse—“fingers touched the cold silver, a profound revulsion filled him”—grounds abstract despair in visceral heat. Motivation tightens from quiet resentment to explosive creation; the final unmaking is paid for with lifelong failure. The earned cost—creation born of every scrap of his own waste—makes the transformation credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choices (wiring the fragment, dampening the hiss) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—hands falling from controls—earns the silence as cradle. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Felix’s resilient positivity is embodied in action—calming passengers, seizing the hourglass, broadcasting will. Interiority is concrete (“he understood…with sudden instinctual clarity”) and the final smile carries the cost of permanent solitude. Motivation escalates from reassurance to ontological repair, earned by prior causal beats. Only a slight surplus of summary keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “practiced, graceful motions” and memory-shifts under pressure reveal a coherent professional identity. The contradiction between clinical detachment and empathic intrusion is dramatized, not stated. Arthur’s single on-page reaction crystallizes the cost of her craft, earning the closure. Minor slip: the phrase “texture of connection” edges toward label-speak, blunting the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the link, fusing it to the console) and her shift from private study to species-level mission feels earned. The “balanced” trait, however, is asserted rather than dramatized in contradiction, and the cost of her final act (losing solitary refuge) is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s curiosity is dramatized in how she “listens past the obvious sorrows” and the active kneeling at the bench; interiority remains character-specific and embodied. The final whispered assurance is earned by her prior actions and costs her composure, a credible renunciation foreclosing her usual observational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is voiced and embodied, driving the crawl through the service conduit where panic mashes against resolve; her motives—honor the vanished, endure the dread—are consistent, and her final witness stance crystallizes a credible, earned renunciation. Interiority is distinctive, though a touch of summation creeps in at the codex reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s obsessive heartbeat count is vivid and embodied; it limits her stamina and shapes her pacing. Julian’s fragmentation feels external rather than an interior knot of impulses—he suffers but his POV is absent. Their relationship is filtered through guilt more than live tension, so the crucible never quite heats. Renunciation at the end—she keeps defragmenting knowing the pain—earns a visible cost and fits her self-punishing drive.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hope versus the certainty of loss—is embodied in the diamond’s bite and her refusal to cast it away. The final endurance (“she stood her ground, weeping quietly”) crystallizes her as instrument rather than translator, a credible renunciation with felt cost. Backstory is woven through sensory cues (woven rug, river stone) that tilt present tactics. Minor slip: “terrified” label could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s shift from detached cataloguer to empathetic participant is embodied in the micro-choice to hurl the arrowhead; the contradiction between “tool of division” and “place that understands only connection” crystallizes her arc. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. The cost—renouncing her foundation’s mandate—is legible in the final silence and laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—official duty vs. clandestine care—are embodied in the crisp uniform and the hidden bottle; his micro-choice to linger under the drone’s light crystallizes a hierarchy of values. Liora’s presence is brief but her reaction (eyes widening, clutching the storm) forces Kael’s next beat. The final renunciation—accepting surveillance rather than running—earns its cost in the held breath of the street.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “quietly persistent need” is dramatized through the tactile act of pouring memory into the swan. The final choice—offering silence as vessel—earns the carousel’s song with visible cost (her lifelong reserve spent). No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile ritual (scarf, mosaic steps), but interior contradiction is muted; the “sanely eccentric” label never complicates her flawless execution, so the final smile feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—longing vs. the fear that her art is futile—co-exist in scene. The final choice to paint the dream into air is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the dream’s disappearance from the sky). Minor slip: “cipher of longing” is used as label-speak twice without dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s interiority is precise and embodied; his “quiet proclamations” and tactile reading of star-dust sigils reveal a consistent, idiosyncratic mind. The client’s fear is shown through gesture and silence rather than labels. The final beat—her tear and the ribbon’s demotion to mere cloth—earns a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only the client’s voice remains slightly generic, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    The final epiphany is fully earned: decades of loss charge the act of reaching for the mushroom, and the cost—accepting adult grief for child wonder—is viscerally present in the line "a sharp ache in his chest." Interiority fuses memory and motive without cliché; the contradictory impulse to cling to absence while seeking reunion is dramatized, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—irritation and aching tenderness—are embodied in his backwards gait and sharp teaching; the final forward stride is earned by the apprentice’s discovery that his exile is a lock she can turn. The mentor-student crucible forces Elias to relinquish his role, paying the cost of permanent departure. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only flaw is a slight under-dramatized moment when Elias realizes she has found the key; it is implied rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“calloused feet,” “artist’s hands”—but the final beat of self-sacrifice is slightly abstract; the cost is felt more as lyric assertion than bodily consequence. Motivation is clear and intensifies, yet the contradiction between preserving color and draining herself of it could be sharper in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is embodied (cold dread, phantom taste, tremoring hands); her micro-persistence under pressure and the final “lifted weight” mark earned change. No contradictory drive shown, and the guilt she carries for Kael remains off-stage, so character depth caps shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “shielded openness” and “listening with her eyes” are vivid. The shift from passive observation to empathetic action (whispering gratitude) is earned and costly. Minor: the empathy trait is stated more than dramatized until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet analytic discipline is embodied in every micro-choice—scanning shelves, sealing the note, reaching for the globe—so the trait constrains and enables action with visible cost. The interior contradiction (seeking closure yet fearing its emptiness) is dramatized in the slow-motion shatter, not summarized. Motivation tightens from abstract quest to physical acceptance, foreclosing the path of endless recovery missions. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “physics of letting go” that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“fingers resting on the cold, engraved metal,” “heart hammered against her ribs”—and her motivation to “articulate unspoken needs” is dramatized through the choice to sing the ghost free. The final renunciation (she remains “seldom-heard”) carries felt cost, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. private reverence) act simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to decrypt the diary with the goggles is earned and forecloses her prior ignorance with visible emotional cost. Status dynamics with the new commander are sketched but not fully pressured. One hairline slip: “affectionate detachment” is asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—panic vs. compulsion to finish the chart—drives every beat after the snap. Embodied reactions (numb fingers, stomach plummet) anchor emotion without label-speak. The final acceptance is earned because her earlier frantic recording forecloses retreat; the cost is her irreversible ascent. Micro-choices (dropping telescope, resuming work) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “fingers stroking the fractally precise carvings” and the “tingling” palm under moon-pigment ground her obsession. The contradiction between inability to remember faces yet hunger to trap celestial light is dramatized through micro-choices (prying wood, pressing wax, smearing paint). The final renunciation—no brush, only hand to stone—earns its cost in the glowing wall that forecloses escape. Minor slip: “quiet obsession” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied beats override it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, tracing, silent lip-movement—rather than labels. The final quiet smile and refusal to summon the captain crystallize her solitary triumph with visible cost: permanent isolation from the crew. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing intrudes. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s quiet need to “learn the rhythm of repair” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—sifting gears, uncapping moonlight—but interior contradiction is thin; the final alignment feels inevitable rather than wrested from genuine struggle. Cost is present yet abstract (a degree of warmth, a settled memory), not dramatized on his body or future. Still, the motive stays coherent and drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aelia’s motive—fierce love for the settlers—drives every beat; her nightly drain to animate the bell and the final starlight manifestation embody cost. Interiority is ghost-specific (“shimmer of memory and intention”) yet remains emotionally legible. The shift from silent instructions to full revelation shows earned escalation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the cracked puppet head triggers a credible shift from duty to mercy. The final renunciation—“it was all right to rest”—is earned by the prior discovery and carries visible cost in the stilling of the Clockwork Heart. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. One hairline slip: “voice of every keeper” edges toward grandiosity rather than personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kaelen’s reluctant caretaker persona is sketched cleanly and embodied (finger brushing the withered nut), but the woman is a reactive passenger rather than a crucible. Interior contradiction between duty and fatigue is present yet never pushed to compel a costly micro-choice beyond the initial “curse” and sprint. Earned stasis and visible price land more in the concept (closing the labyrinth forever) than on his flesh. Voice flirts with stock beats (“I’m not here to hurt you”).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“grief felt like a discordant note”), but the decisive turn—choosing fluidity over rigidity—leans on a single epiphanic beat rather than a chain of micro-choices; the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “quiet hum” and “curated chaos” anchor her paradoxical vocation. The client’s shimmer conveys his instability without exposition. Both characters’ micro-choices (Elara guiding the filament, the man’s silent departure) foreclose paths with visible cost. Only the man’s parole lacks lived specificity, keeping the score just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his synesthetic tasting of memories is never abstract label-speak. The contradictory impulse to absorb yet neutralize centuries of remorse is dramatized in the moment his knees buckle and he “grips the pedestal.” The final renunciation—accepting the grief as integrated memory—carries visible psychic cost and is earned by the prior crucible beat. Minor slip: the “chef’s discipline” line edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, but the embodied agony quickly reasserts.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “vigorous and tender” handling of the brass weight embodies the empathetically decisive trait. The contradiction between technical command and lyrical comfort is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Cost is felt: she gives the city her voice and accepts the open-ended labor—“her work had only just begun.” Minor slip: the phrase “empathetically decisive” is used once as label, not fully earned by dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—graphite-stained hands, synaptic retraining—but the moment of integration (“his failure was now her foundation”) arrives as summary rather than embodied choice, blunting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s prism-minded POV stays vivid—data fractured, synesthetic flare—and her internal calculus powers each move (“her stomach lurched…”). Motivation glints early yet intensifies only when inverted gravity re-signals the page’s cipher, not from within prior pressure. Embodied cost is felt in the final surrender to sentinel duty, but internal contradiction and self-deception remain underplayed, preventing the 9+ tier. Micro-choices are present, though the moment of planting the seed in herself reads slightly predetermined rather than tortured by prior flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “reading the fissures like a map of past failures” shows contradiction and cost. Motivation (create music) is constant and intensifies through micro-choices (shaving wood, repositioning arch). The final strum is earned by prior forensic empathy and carries visible emotional cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s exile-guilt and “beauty in the difficult” creed drive every micro-choice; the stone’s dent embodies anxious obsession, his counter-hum is a tactical risk, and the final weary awareness costs him solitude. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The cartographer is sketched only as needed, so relationship crucible is thin—keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ariadne’s drive is lucid and embodied; her hands adjusting “a micron to the left” shows exacting need. Interiority is almost tactile until the ending slips into a slightly authorial generalization about forgiving noise. The earned turn—accepting the fireworks’ cacophony—pays visible cost by relinquishing her lifelong purity of silence. Flaw empathy would sharpen with one explicit earlier contradiction (e.g., a flicker of annoyance she must repress); without it she feels consistent rather than freshly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior wants versus needs are sharply drawn; embodied impatience ("her sleeve brushed a mature leaf") triggers the climax beat. The final renunciation—breathing the rot—makes the cost of her flaw visceral. Reflection is capped at ~25% of word-count and each memory cue tilts the present stance. Micro-choice lineage (the doodles) reweights her tactics and earns Earned Stasis at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s quiet obsession with the Grovetree’s secret is established early and drives every beat; her micro-choice to chase the inverted water flow is embodied and stakes-raising. Interiority is concrete (“her stomach lurching,” “harness straining”) but occasionally drifts toward summary (“she understood”). The final renunciation—becoming a guardian rather than an owner—earns its cost through the tactile warmth of the arrow tip and the vanishing echoes. Flaws are hinted (obsession bordering on recklessness) but not fully mined for contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vale’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse quickens, her boots echo, her fingers brush the patch—yet the “cultivate foresight” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final transmission. The contradictory impulse (observe vs. intervene) is present but compressed; the cost of staying to transmit is felt but not fully foreshadowed by prior micro-choices. Still, her perceptual signature is sharp and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and synesthetic, but the bell ringer’s “quiet desperation” is stated rather than embodied; the final renunciation of ringing is earned by the prior longing, yet the cost feels more abstract than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—fear vs. desperate curiosity—drives every beat; the embodied cost of “unravel oneself” lands in the final image. Micro-choices (kneeling, uncasing, blowing silent breath) reveal hierarchy of values. The shift from keeper to learner is earned and forecloses her old identity. Only the driftwood markers feel slightly external to her psyche, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s obsession to quantify feeling is vividly embodied; every micro-choice tracks to her flaw. The borrowed-personality habit is dramatized twice: grafting archivist despair and, in the final strobe, the realization that all grafts leave only hollowness. The cost is undeniable: she weeps at the zero-sum of her borrowed selfhood. Internal contradiction stays in scene rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s jittery hands and buried hope are embodied early; the pendant’s hum dissolves his tremor into calm, a credible shift earned by the scene’s pressure. Kael’s absence is felt as ache, not exposition. The final nod from luminous-Kael crystallizes mentorship into legacy with visible cost: the road is now Silas’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for human emotion in objects yet blind to non-human truth—drives every beat; her micro-choice to shift attention from prism to frost crystallizes the arc with visible cost (loss of original thesis). Embodied shiver and tactile grounding anchor her shift. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—dye-stained fingers, the loom’s weight, the nightly unraveling—but the “latent sacrifice” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The contradiction between endless weaving and the need to stop is present yet compressed; a single earlier micro-choice showing her resisting surrender would have locked 9+. Still, the renunciation lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—meekness vs. forge-born resolve—is embodied in the tactile clutch of silk and the whispered barter of memories; the final renunciation of fear lands with visible cost as the silo glows azure. One slip: “meek spirit” is label-speak mid-crisis, blunting embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard’s weight in her palm, the “murder of half-remembered dreams,” and the final micro-choice to accept the anchor all ring true. Motivation is singular and intensifies to the decisive stance crystallization. The withheld-truth reveal lands with felt cost, though the mentor’s fear is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s taciturn practicality is embodied through tactile micro-choices (hand worrying glass, dropping to knees mid-haunting). His protective impulse for the archive crystallizes from accumulated loneliness rather than stated trait, granting credible motivation in the final defiant “No.” A slight shortfall: the interior monologue lapses into summarizing “bottled feeling of safety,” which edges toward therapist-speak and blunts the embodied contradiction that could have lifted the character work to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—solitary mockery vs. world-shaping duty—are embodied in the tremor of his hand and the rasp of his laugh; the final beat crystallizes his awe and terror, paying the cost of irreversible historical meddling.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hira’s contradictory impulses—quiet observation vs. explosive need—are embodied in the morpho-wing beat and the sun-trail trek; the final integration of the donor heart as “instrument of perception” is earned and costly. Interiority is specific to a dyer’s chromatic vocabulary. Minor slip: “quietly explosive” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory desire to both measure and understand grief is dramatized through micro-choices (climbing, angling the sextant, lowering it). The final renunciation—leaving the mended sextant—earns its cost by reframing her entire vocation. One hairline slip: “her own sorrow…suddenly feeling lighter” edges toward label-speak, though the vegetal sacrifice image rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, bone-deep collapse) and her knitting trait is dramatized through the swaddling ritual. Motivation is clear, but the internal contradiction—fear of loss vs. hope of recall—remains stated rather than acted out in a single micro-choice. The final communal singing is earned, yet the cost to Elara personally is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the crumpled invitation as “gravitational force” externalizes her shame. The final renunciation—rejoining yet remaining self-defined—earns its cost through prior dread and the tactile memory of failure. One minor slip: “enlarged tranquility” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—seeds in pockets, fossil bread as memory anchor. Her contradictory impulses (to mourn the fade vs. plant against it) play out in micro-choices: kneeling, accepting bread, planting crocuses. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she now knows the garden must be tended in secret, a lifelong vigil. Only the single POV keeps relationship crucible off-page, so minor cap.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority remain steady—too steady. The slide catalyzes discovery, but her stance never cracks or pivots under pressure; no new knowledge rewrites her hierarchy of values, only reaffirms them. The result feels like competent stewardship rather than character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—vengeance vs lingering filial trust—are dramatized in the hand-clasp beat; the sigh she records is an embodied cost that forecloses her former loyalty. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Silas’s micro-gesture supplies credible pressure that forces her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—empirical skeptic vs synesthetic seeker—drives every beat; the shift from observer to participant is embodied in the warming ring and the taste of “sunlight on lavender.” Cost is felt: he forfeits detached analysis for communal stewardship. Minor slip: the woman’s speech edges toward thematic echo, blunting full individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority vivid— “charcoal-stained fingers” and “etched onto the back of his eyelids” embody the mnemonic curse and guilt. Micro-choice: hurling the strongbox— raw frustration manifests flaw that later keys the transformation. However, the shift from servant-artist to self-originating creator occurs largely in summarizing awe rather than a beat of risky choice under pressure; the final kneel is felt, less “paid” in immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s wilting trait is embodied early and constrains every public move; the interior contradiction between thirst for truth and bodily fragility drives the descent. The final choice—to drink and grow—earns its cost through prior bodily collapse and the plumber’s confession. Only the plumber’s single line keeps this from 9+, as the relationship pressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s seasonal muteness and bell-tuner identity are not labels—they deterministically shape every micro-choice: climbing, cleaning, retuning, cradling. Interiority shows simultaneous reverence and urgency; she renounces voice yet still listens—infinite contradiction acted out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    K-27’s longing for “perfect silence” and its embodied dread of the static are vivid; the micro-choice to compress rather than delete fear is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“scorched smell,” “cool, sleek muscle”) and avoids label-speak. The final integration of past into present is visible in the two-toned rose, paying the price of permanent alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “need to prove that listening heals” is dramatized through the choice to hear Leo rather than interrogate. The contradiction between her curatorial detachment and empathetic compulsion is present but not fully mined under pressure. The final renunciation—she does not seek Anya but becomes the conduit—earns its cost in Leo’s trembling grasp.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s calm defiance is embodied in every micro-choice—tracing glyphs, dancing ciphers—yet the interior contradiction between loneliness and purpose is dramatized rather than labeled. The final renunciation of her own lock carries visible cost as the dice dissolve, earning the shift from warden to liberator. One slip: the AI’s instant familiarity feels slightly unearned, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s loneliness and secret-keeping are embodied; her embodied shivers under gravitational pockets and fierce need to grasp the one lost memory reveal a consistent, vulnerable interior. Motivation tightens steadily until the exhumed memory delivers both love and grief—renunciation is credible, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aeliana’s interiority is precise and embodied; every fold of the wing is a micro-choice under rising stakes. The final “peace-pour” renunciation earns a visible cost: world silence at expense of personal strain.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—yearning to decode the building yet clinging to polite fictions—plays out in embodied micro-choices (ascending, accepting the seal). The final acceptance of custodianship carries visible cost: she is left alone, seal in hand, the old tongue now hers to keep alive.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. keeper of impossible flora—drives every micro-choice; the shell’s grip and her tremor embody the cost. The final “Live” lands as earned renunciation of denial, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelin’s desperation to amend her brother’s fate anchors every micro-choice; her interiority pulses through embodied details—the thorn in her grip, the aurora reflected on the inkwell—without ever slipping into label-speak. Varos’s shared grief converts potential adversary status into nuanced pressure and reconfigures their silent hierarchy. The final moment of pressing the royal seal lands as a earned price: her solitary guilt is re-braided into state-sanctioned absolution while the cost of that complicity registers in the marble quiet. Every beat shows motive refined under increasing, believable stress.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—embodied in her heightened perception—while the moment she “opened her mouth and sang” carries a felt renunciation. A faint abstract tinge (“her life was one of quiet service”) costs some immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet, desperate need”), her motive is consistent, and the final renunciation—silencing the purser’s lie—carries felt cost. Yet the absence of on-page contradiction or micro-choice under pressure keeps her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ren’s quiet, embodied ritualism is vivid; his refusal of recognition and the bamboo whisk micro-choice show interior contradiction and cost. Lin functions mainly as a prompt, not a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. The final release of the firefly carries earned, visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test despite the low-stakes frame.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's "to excavate…no matter how deeply" is clear and reiterated, but interior contradiction—her drive vs. compassion to shield the orchard—never turns a decisive present beat; the final choice is intuited via stillness rather than earned through visible dilemma. She remains sharply observant, yet no micro-choice during the storm visibly weighs abandoning the dig against continuing it, so cost feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cassian’s interiority is vivid—his loneliness, thrill, and final resolve are embodied in trembling hands and gritted oaths. The variant-allegiance conflict is dramatized through the live choice between Aerie and prophet, not summarized. The cost of renouncing the Aerie is felt in the storm’s energy drain and the momentary blackout. Only the Aerie’s voice is off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orin’s fixation on preserving fading memory is clear and emotionally embodied, visible each dawn as he sets out with the cart. Internal contradiction—romantic collector vs. reluctant medium—flashes when the box’s empty bell redefines “salvage” from record to resurrection; however, the shift is narrated more than dramatized, lowering full conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his “bones” registering the ice’s wrongness—and his micro-choice to listen rather than force the horn shows earned growth. The final quiet triumph carries visible cost: the sunset’s extinction and the tower’s groan. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into patience—remains embodied in micro-choices (checking charts, holding ground) and culminates in the earned renunciation of forcing the change. The transformation is credible and scaled to length, though the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps her arc from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the psychic jolt from the lantern crystallizes her contradictory impulses—empirical discipline vs. inherited witness—into a single, costly stance. The final renunciation of a conventional report is earned by the lantern’s visceral possession. Minor slip: “fortified vulnerability” is slightly label-like, but the embodied cost overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vale’s guilt and desire to honor the dead prisoner are clear, but the interior contradiction—his helplessness versus his pastoral duty—stays mostly summary. Liam’s “aptly deliberate” curiosity is shown once in gesture, yet never complicates his choice to help; the pivot arm repair is Liam’s mechanical act, not Vale’s moral one. The final tearful gasp registers, but the cost lands on Liam’s epiphany more than Vale’s. Still, the brass heart’s beating does reconfigure Vale’s stance toward redemption, so the arc is earned, if thin.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Fix is well-delineated—curious posture and bell obsession collide in action (Resonator tuning, kaleidoscope pivot). Interiority is embodied (physically leaning over rails, tasting acid fumes) rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s curiosity, guilt, and stubborn pursuit are vividly rendered, but her moments of actual micro-choice under pressure are slim; the discovery phase drifts into summary rather than embodied dilemma, muting the cost she ultimately faces.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—“shadow-laced,” “calmly intuitive”—and her shift from static guardian to active intervener is embodied in the orchard descent and mobilization scene. Kael’s fear and courage are shown through stumbling, frost-laced breath, and the shard he carries, not labels. The final image of the fragment as “symbol of a future chosen” crystallizes her earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from pain-erased to hyper-sensitive is dramatized through tactile work and the parasol tip. Motivation evolves credibly from seeking death to seeking the sound of endings, but the final beat of “freedom” feels slightly abstract—cost is implied rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—her struggle to transform “always” from Leo to the land—is embodied and specific. The final micro-choice (scattering the ash) renounces the love path and commits to custodial endurance, ringing the “cost with felt ambiguity” bell. The dully aching retrospective interiority tilts toward psychologizing rather than embodied immediacy at two beats, capping this at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Line Walker’s motive—preserve the echo of wisdom—drives every micro-choice; his peripheral-vision method embodies the interior contradiction of needing to see without looking. Embodied tension in the static prickle and the will-driven dune shift shows emotion in action. The final renunciation (letting the pearl sink) costs him the clearing and the prophet’s truth, earned by prior tactics. Secondary character (prophet) applies direct pressure that alters the relationship state by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and personal, but her interiority stays largely observational; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. The final act of bringing descendants to the field is earned by her archival drive, yet the cost to her is only implied, not embodied. Secondary characters exert pressure only through photographs, not on-page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is credibly embodied—her fingertip lexicon-touch, the climb, the shard held aloft—but interior contradiction is muted; we feel her wonder more than her struggle, so the earned cost reads gentle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s junkyard-prophet persona is vivid—her sift-through-refuse compulsion and precognitive amnesia are embodied in micro-choices like chalking a melting sculpture. Interior contradiction—longing for tomorrow while erasing it—pushes her final stance of grasping the unknowable hum. Earned renunciation and felt cost scale cleanly to the 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal conflict is sustained through sensory-led micro-choices (“her fingers tracing…her hands, though they trembled, did not falter”) and embodied emotion; flaws are inherent but not labored. The renunciation/unlocked stasis is felt: she trades survival for an impossible capture, cost compressed in the final screen’s image. Motive lucid, specific to this POV. No secondary on-page character, so relationship crucible not invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her micro-choice to withhold the results and use music instead is credible and costly. The broken vinyl talisman anchors her motivation without exposition. Mr. Gable’s final recognition of “Claire” is earned by the sensory thread she weaves. Only a slight reserve in her self-contradiction keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, deliberate compulsion is embodied in her careful handling of relics and persistent questioning; the interior tension between scholarly curiosity and personal grief quietly intensifies. One pivotal micro-choice—inserting the key—earns the decisive first contact with the automaton and forecloses her former purely academic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s skepticism and grief are embodied in her cataloguing eye and visceral disgust at the waxen effigy; the contradictory calm that follows feels earned. The leap from historian to bone-setter is seeded via grandfather memory, so the final splinting is credible. Micro-choice—slipping away “shrewdly innocent”—reveals hierarchy of values. Cost is visible in the broken arm and the unspoken price of entering Faerie, but interiority flirts with diagnostic self-awareness (“a cleft in certainty”) that slightly blurs the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s desire to share light without fire is clear and embodied in tactile micro-choices; the internal contradiction between solitude and outreach is present but not pushed to crisis. The final renunciation—leaving rather than proclaiming—earns its cost through the grandmother’s memory and the grotto’s changed light, yet the arc remains gentle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (amber burn, shame texture); Elara’s contradiction between hiding and yearning to repossess her story is present on the page. Minor slip: the phrase “grafting new meaning” edges toward label-speak at the critical beat. Still, the final hand-opening gesture is earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—collecting others’ hopes while doubting his own—remains embodied and specific; the spiral shell anchors his arc without slipping into symbol cliché. The final renunciation (to write the woman’s story, not the fisherman’s) is earned by the cameo encounter and carries visible cost: he abandons the safety of artifact-hoarding. Micro-choice under pressure is present but compressed; the woman’s exit could be sharper to crystallize the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—oil-smudged fingers, pocket gears, inherited duty—but her contradictory impulses remain off-stage; the shift from “hope failing” to effortless song feels externally driven rather than wrestled from inner conflict. The cost of restoring the vine is aesthetic, not personal; she ends whole, not changed.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and particular—her decade-long condensation of starlight, the grief-driven constellation of glacier-rose petals, the palm-up stillness that waits for the alembic’s pulse. Contradictory impulses (the flash-paper past vs. the reverent present) coexist in the same gesture; the final sealing burns away her remaining starlight, a visible cost that forecloses future maps. No stock labels; every beat is filtered through her sensory discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “quiet, obsessive need” and “peripheral focus” manifest in concrete micro-choices (tracing light with a mirror, tuning the crystal). The flaw of storing wonder against decay is dramatized through the final cost: she leaves the cavern with the echo now stored inside the stone, a felt forfeiture of immediate wonder. One minor slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between her need to measure sorrow and her fear of being consumed is dramatized in the calcification beat. The moment she relaxes into the grief—micro-choice with visible cost—earns her endurance and closes her arc. No stock phrasing; every sensation is filtered through her vocation. Flaw: the “fractal weaver” label is never tested by an on-page rule or limit, so competence feels slightly unbounded.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the contradictory pull between grief and the need to “harvest lessons” is dramatized in her micro-choice to carve the cupped-hand curve. The final renunciation—letting the kettle’s click end the session—earns its cost because the prior beats have shown how precious each second of allowed ache is. No slips touch closure, but the widow’s competence edges toward near-perfect emotional calibration, keeping her just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ambition calcified into regret—drives every micro-choice (turning the wheel, confronting the ghost). The embodied cost is palpable in her cracked knees and the final, silent negotiation. Yet the younger self’s smile feels slightly too neat, blunting the flaw’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “functionally creative” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—aligning the sextant, tracing pipes, rerouting power—each with visible risk and embodied cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; the “stoic wonder” is shown in breath-held stillness and grease-stained fingers. The final stance crystallizes her values: she accepts the cost of salvaging a future rather than preserving a past. One minor slip: the phrase “equations for hope” edges toward abstraction before being grounded again.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound yet bound to silence—drives every micro-choice; the excruciatingly gentle touch and the final release of the score are embodied, costly, and character-specific. Motivation intensifies from routine task to existential reckoning without slipping into summary. The dream’s renunciation is earned and carries visible cost in the bear’s acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority shows authentic, layered motives—the search for truth as both obsession and self-examination—and his final crystallizing realization is emotionally earned. Voice is distinct, but secondary setting cues limit relationship interplay. Overall depth strong for single POV.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s infinitely-patient, reflective interior convincingly spirals into the active decoding move; the fulgurite lens moment crystallises both her flaw (spurned action) and earned cost. Missing only a more fraught micro-choice under intensifying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise—his method of “projecting presence” is dramatized through sensory detail and micro-choice. The Countess’s grief is embodied in her posture and milky gaze; her revelation about the carpet thread crystallizes a shared value. The final smile is earned, showing a credible shift from isolation to acknowledged place. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s obsession is embodied in oil-smudged clothes and shadowed eyes; the contradictory pull between sterile safety and aching beauty is dramatized in the trembling assembly of the key and the final tear-streaked listening. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the renunciation (accepting the song as echo, not resurrection) costs him the fantasy of full restoration. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (daughter of arsonist turned firefighter) is embodied in tactile micro-choices—selecting obsidian, threading coin—so motive stays visceral. The final act of “listening to the music she made from the silence he left” crystallizes a renunciation with visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “quiet obsession” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied grafting overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her tactile testing of the box and her refusal to force it; the interior contradiction between imaginative reconstruction and gritty realism drives every beat. The final stance—silent witness to the city’s remembered joy—earns its cost through seven nights of sidereal vigil. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is luminous and embodied—“coalescence of ambient light and conscious dust”—but the inherited duty never collides with a contradictory impulse on the page; the break with generational non-interference is declared rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to refract rather than destroy is credible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliran’s interiority is textured and embodied; the shift from solitary carver to translator of collective grief is earned through tactile micro-choices with the ribbons and greenhouse. The spectral chorus is credibly internal, not expository. Cost is felt in the final renunciation of static monuments for living memory.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s ethical diligence is embodied in every micro-choice; the rake-handle confessions force him to confront inherited guilt and act with trembling precision. Interior contradiction surfaces when he must harm the clock’s perfection to heal it. The final descent with “weight on his soul lifted” shows earned change, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is rooted and believable, her tactile engagement with objects reveals agency and interiority, and her final renunciation—restoring the locket to the chest—bears visible weight. Yet the absence of second-person pressure or relationship crucible prevents exploitation of deeper contradictions; the interior tension is single-thread rather than braided, stopping just short of exceptional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas emerges as a compelling interior protagonist whose grounded logic and iron commitment to constraint power the arc. His refusal to accept probable decline in favour of an impossible-certain reactor earns a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses the grey-energy future—Earned Stasis visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “thistled calm” is embodied in the tactile ritual of copying scores—but the leap from passive listener to active transmitter is slightly under-dramatized; we see the crystallized motivation (“teach the dust”) more than the moment it crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her reverence versus tremble, her need to preserve versus knowledge it’s a lie. The mask and ash function as extensions of her psyche, and her final blow fuses memory with reality at visible cost. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her tactile grief. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“understood the profound deception”) that momentarily cools the heat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s exile motive and obsession with salvaged knowledge are clear; the brass cog triggers a visible shift from detached calm to urgent descent. Interiority is textured (“abrasive calm,” “quiet defiance”) and embodied. The final resolve to “restart the clock of history” is earned by the evidence he literally holds, with the cost of abandoning his former isolation legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliza’s interiority is embodied and specific; her “expectantly resigned” stance is dramatized through micro-choices (hand on zither, isolating voices). Leo’s unlearning hatred is shown via tonal shift rather than label-speak. The final renunciation—program ends, moment persists—earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, tasting her own blank past—and her micro-choices (pruning, planting, plating) track motive to cost. The final self-taste crystallizes her arc with felt price. Minor slip: “hollow” is asserted more than embodied early on.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arawn’s involuntary candor is embodied in the unbidden “I am afraid” line, grounding his flaw in scene. The micro-choice to sacrifice city lights for the hives crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt in the single lantern flicker above a darkened city. Interiority stays specific, though the grandfather’s ethos is slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from observer to participant is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, digging, planting). The contradiction between her “quiet obsession” and the act of theft is present but could be sharper under pressure. Cost is legible in the final image: she forfeits the shard and her detachment. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veridian’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the shift from certainty to nuanced welcome is dramatized through micro-choices (shifting coral, dislodging stone, raising his own fist). The final dissolution carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grim optimism is embodied in every beat—she triple-checks safety equations before risking a fall, and her contradictory impulses (order vs. manufactured chaos) act simultaneously. The chipped die externalizes her flaw and drives the final maneuver; the cost is the fresh fracture that marks her leap into uncertainty. Interiority stays concrete and mathematically inflected, avoiding therapy-speak. The earned renunciation of “capturing the missed opportunity” in favor of embracing new uncertainty lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s alternating insomnia-night vs muted-day perception feels lived in; her unresolved creative paralysis and later decision to write on the glass carry visible, embodied cost, tying the character flaw to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her panic is “cold and sharp,” her resolve “desperate.” The contradiction between her curatorial calm and frantic action under pressure is dramatized in the turbine scene. The final renunciation (casting the bread) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the beekeeper’s absence is more label than lived loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliran’s interiority is audibly unique—his self-invented clockworks literalise his will to rewind destiny; the moment he seats the stone and realises the mechanism reverses causality itself shows a decisive, cost-burdened stance that forecloses life as-is. His hunger to outrun fate is embodied in oil-stained fingers and frantic microadjustments, so flaws (hubris, isolation) visibly ramify under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “discarded opera cloak clasp” metaphor crystallizes self-loathing—but the whispering advisor remains a cipher whose motives never complicate Elias’s choices. The final beat earns its renunciation: the clasp becomes “simply a piece of metal,” a credible shedding of symbolic weight. Yet the advisor’s pressure lacks embodied cost on Elias, muting relational crucible effects.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “calm fire” and aching arm—but the contradiction between serene purpose and physical strain is stated rather than dramatized in scene. Motivation is consistent, yet the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost is only physical fatigue, not a deeper forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—dread vs. hope, secrecy vs. duty—are dramatized in the descent and whistle-blow. The final choice is earned by prior pattern study and carries visible communal cost. A hairline slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than shown in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s arc moves plausibly from distant scholar to uneasy fellow-traveler; his interior handling of Elara’s revelations is embodied and specific, but his final pivot to partnership feels lightly earned rather than wrenching. His emotional restraint stays consistent, anchoring POV—the “emotionally rational” trait is shown tactically rather than claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction pulses—Ansel’s stoic self-image versus raw sensitivity—drives every action from boot-squelching wade to tremor when Elara appears. Each micro-choice (stone sealed, ink offered) crystallizes hierarchy of values: records over reputation, shared memory over solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’ tranquil perception drives every beat—he hears the blackout settle, infers the stamp code via stillness, and endures solid darkness to earn the truth. Interior contradiction (yearning for order vs. relic honesty) is embodied in micro-choices rather than told. Final renunciation of official history costs him isolation, meeting earned-stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s interiority is vivid—grief embodied in “luminous torment” and the tactile folding of memory. The contradictory impulse to descend physically while “ascending” spiritually crystallizes his arc. Micro-choice of surrendering soul-fragment for the gem shows cost. Only Keeper’s dialogue feels generic, slightly diluting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s survivor-ghost persona is vivid, but interior dialogue sometimes lapses into analytic summary (“a desperate need to find purpose”). A single decision—stepping into the mirror pool reconfigures his stance—earns felt cost and final agency.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “perpetually surprised” face is re-weighted in the final awe—but her shift from contract to sacred duty is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged mid-scene, so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—greed vs. guilt—are embodied in tactile beats (numb fingers, leaden stomach) and culminate in the on-page renunciation that costs her both client and self-image. The withheld-truth motive is dramatized, not labeled, and the final choice is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the client’s interiority is asserted rather than shown, slightly flattening the crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; the drawer-pull micro-choice crystallizes her shift from guilt to shared responsibility. Kael’s shame is shown through gesture and silence, not labels. The final renunciation lands with visible cost—both leave the token behind—earning the closure under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for grand meaning yet embracing humble utility-pole navigation—are dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of celestial mastery carries visible emotional cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“familiar hollow ache,” “scraping against the grain”). The compass as relic rather than tool crystallizes his shift. Minor slip: “merrily melancholic” is asserted more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hollow memories yet urgent drive—remains vivid; her gentle choice to kneel and offer water crystallizes the earned empathy. The “clean slate” paradox is embodied in micro-choices rather than labels. No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in the cavern’s hush. Final cost: she forfeits self-absorption for another’s life.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alaric’s interiority is embodied and specific—his paradoxical steadiness under moonlight, the weight of the fortune in his palm—but the bond with Kael is told more than dramatized; we feel the loss yet never see the living friendship under pressure. The final choice to step into memory is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory hunger to recover lost time while stealing every second she chases is embodied in micro-gesture (trembling hands, breath-sip of starlight). The birth trauma is the engine—every card flip and ink swirl is shadow-cost: absence from her infant. Interiority feels lived-in (“each second… a particle of sand lost”).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Steward’s pacifist directive and grief-driven mission are vivid and embodied; its mass-as-emotion trait is dramatized through slowed drift and final lightening. Interior contradiction—duty to preserve vs. need to release—drives every beat. The final push is earned by accumulated sorrow and hope, with visible cost: the AI’s own gravitational weight lifts as it offers itself. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—need to give vs. need to understand—are embodied in the lightning-bug release; the final kneeling beat crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied, though the old woman functions more as oracle than crucible, slightly flattening relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s calm-inventive trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (counting sundial lines, palming the holder) and the final renunciation of violence; the cost—exposure to Vorlag—lands on the page. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. Minor slip: “singular and pure” motivation is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—promise vs. self-preservation—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Embodied emotion (“his teeth ache”) grounds the curse without label-speak. Micro-choices (sprinkling dust, holding ground) reveal a hierarchy of values. The only slip is a slight drift toward abstract summary in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradictions—rebellion cooled into mapping rather than acting—are dramatized in every tactile choice she makes from page 1 onward. Her embodied dread when red light snaps to black gives real weight to “map of loss” without resorting to labeled emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Valerius’s mechanical arm and Elara’s diplomatic fierceness are embodied through precise micro-choices—his inhuman pivot, her 45° guard—yet the interior contradiction between shared goal and adversarial stance is only implied, not dramatized in real time. The final salute and joint retrieval earn a partnership shift with visible cost (her foil clatters, his arm points), but the emotional layering feels slightly under-pressured for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s molting trait is vivid early, but the monthly cadence is asserted rather than dramatized; the “repairman” persona is shown only through book-mending, not tested under pressure. Elara’s interiority is sketched via gesture, yet her institutional weariness remains generic. The final molt-as-evolution lands cleanly, but the cost is more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “steely longing” is embodied in tactile piano work and the twitch of the clock hand. Motive (surprise fate) is dramatized through the risky atonal performance, not stated. The final smile and quiet note show earned cost. Minor: the conductor’s pressure is functional but generic, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs luminous doubt—drives every beat; the dream sequence forces her to act against her training, and the final renunciation of “plant” for “wake” carries visible cost (her instruments are abandoned). The luminous doubt is embodied, not labeled, and her micro-choice atop the ridge crystallizes values with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen’s regret is embodied (the “cerulean regret” washing over him) and his interior contradiction—wanting to speak yet shaping trees instead—drives the micro-choice to follow the lace. The final renunciation (silence woven into bonsai) is earned and carries visible cost. Elara’s slow speech is shown once but never tested under pressure, so her role remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction ("strip needless drama" vs emerging wonder) acts simultaneously in scene; embodied grief through robotic clearing decaying at wing discovery. Final renunciation of emotional armor earned by dust accumulation with visible cost in "a woman remade."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority shines via charcoal-dusted hands and "granular" purpose, but "steadily adaptive" is stated not shown through tradeoffs. Final choice earned by frost archaeology, though contradictions in her artist/survivor duality could deepen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation (translating silence into music) drives every micro-choice, with embodied grief ("typhoon within") and hope ("pulsing gold") contradicting in scene. Final choice to "make silence sing" earns closure through prior causality, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines through specific actions (fitting flawed lens imperfectly), but grandfather's dissolution lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure excel though final change edges toward tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Kael's "weight strapped to his soul" vs community-building drive; Maever's apple burial reveals values through micro-choice with embodied cost ("trembling hands"). Slight motivation shift from rejecting dependence to embracing Maever's method lacks sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation intensifies cleanly but interiority leans abstract ("profound and urgent need") without sufficient embodied struggle during pivotal discovery. Final choice feels earned but lacks visible micro-tactical tradeoffs beyond weeping.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s trapped-yet-racing mind, but the mother’s sudden corporeal return lacks visible micro-choices to ground the reunion’s emotional cost beyond the photos’ disintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in chain symbolism ("weight he carried"/"dead thing") and embodied sacrifice, but sentry confrontation lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy; final self-imprisonment needs one prior gesture to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in memory sequence—feeling mentor's envy while experiencing betrayal—but "sorrowful peace" slightly tells rather than embodies the earned shift. Micro-choices under pressure (activating forge despite fear) anchor motivation in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive ("press your ear against destiny’s door") drives her risk-taking without abstraction; her "luminous disbelief" finale embodies contradictory awe and unworthiness. Flaw: "genius hidden in plain sight" tells rather than shows her savvy.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction ("curse and gift" of contemplation) is clear but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in key beats; abandonment choice is earned but micro-choices under pressure remain sparse during the pivotal bookmark release.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority shines with "trembling with certainty" and vulnerability-as-power motivation, but ocean phobia lacks embodied contradiction during climax ("throat tightened" is generic label). Final choice lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, failing 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in obsession with silence as both refuge and map, but "quiet awe" lacks embodied specificity; micro-choice interpreting the flake as completion shows values hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through robotic composure—curiosity overpowering self-preservation protocols during timeline experiments. Final amalgamation choice feels earned by prior obsessive testing, with visible cost in dissolved fractured existence. No second character limits relationship crucible, but single-POV baseline fully satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in climax: "weapon that could shatter... reputation" vs "confession? burden?" drives authentic choice. Embodied emotion ("breath that felt like her first") avoids therapy-speak. Slight underdevelopment of solitude motivation prevents 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (fear of exposure vs. conviction in garden's memory) drive her marble-revealing climax. Slight over-articulation of "wisely pragmatic" borders on diagnostic label-speak but doesn't undermine her embodied choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lacks contradictory impulses in Aris's obsession; Vesh's shift from skepticism to awe is embodied but no visible cost for Aris weakens the earned change. Micro-choices like the lever adjustment show value hierarchy but insufficient internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("sacred duty") is clear but interiority shows no irrationality or struggle under pressure, missing 9+ gate despite strong embodied emotion ("heart hammered"). Flaws don't complicate choices—she succeeds without tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction shines in "bent but unbroken" botanical study versus smudging the leaf, embodying his method. Micro-choices like tracing the drawing reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks visible friction during data verification, slightly weakening motivation escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses ("drowsy alertness") and embodied choices under pressure culminate in the valve turn, earning closure through causal motivation. Minor deduction as "reckless explorer" trait isn't tested until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction (observation vs. preservation) drives the pivotal choice, but "placid lake" cliché slightly abstracts embodied emotion during crisis. Micro-choice of unfolding the swan reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority shows embodied emotion (Leo’s tear, throat touch) but "tight shell of fear" borders on label-only feeling. Contradictory impulses (fear/curiosity) act simultaneously during eclipse, yet motivation relies slightly on therapy-speak ("nurture lifelong wonder"). Final smile earns change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Alistair’s shift from collector to scribe, but "sensitively perceptive" remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during the diary crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s weariness is embodied (“too weary to question”), but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond exhaustion; Eli’s motivation is clear but his “melancholy” remains abstract without specific tradeoffs in the pivotal rowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel’s embodied contradiction—using logic as weapon while recognizing the entity’s terror—shines in the pigment-dipping moment. Carver’s minimal characterization fits the scope, avoiding diagnostic labels during possession (“swirling motes in a face of congealed night”). Slight deduction for limited Carver interiority pre-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via "chronological homesickness" made visceral through numb fingers and fossilized labyrinth; avoids diagnostic labels except near-clunker "conductor of unheard symphonies" in peak action (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in gravity defiance vs emotional fall, embodied via "grief was a physical blow" and "shame was acid." Slight deduction for "periodically eternal" feeling conceptual rather than demonstrated tradeoffs in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority rooted in tactile specificity—numbness shattered through vibration, not abstract triumph. Contradictory impulses (grief/teaching) drive micro-choices like backward phonograph method. Leo’s frustration heat and Inara’s chest-to-heart technique avoid label-speak. Only slight thinness in Leo’s depth prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (solitude vs truth-telling) drive the pigeon dispatch choice with visible cost; embodied emotion in "residue of alertness" avoids labels. No therapy-speak during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Silas’s grief-turned-joy; embodied tears and micro-choice to inhale the vial reveal values under pressure. No therapy-speak, just sensory truth: "tears carving clean paths through the dust." Elara’s wistful empathy drives action without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines via rope’s "pattern of desperation and freedom"; embodied choice (laying circle not binding) earns renunciation with visible cost ("forever deny himself"). No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines: "not to remember, but to reply" crystallizes her drive. Micro-choices (bow still, bowl over violin) reveal hierarchy of values. Final listening choice earned through acoustic causality, with visible cost in "heartbreaking chorus" reweighting grief as grace.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in "affectionate detachment" epiphany—crafted replica embodies her isolation. Micro-choice pressing blotter to sap wall reveals value hierarchy: authenticity over clinical precision. Slight over-articulation of "symphony of genuine feeling" risks therapy-speak but redeemed by immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("logic refuge" vs. "messy complications") embodied through micro-choices with the glass eyes; earned epiphany avoids therapy-speak via concrete action ("trembling hands" peering through lenses), though flaw manifestation lacks deeper external consequence beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "lies born from necessity" vs. "inherited sin was silence"; embodied emotion in teeth-aching vibration and "whispered into intricate weave" avoids labels.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s "lifelong need to translate confusion into clarity" drives every action, shown through tactile problem-solving ("fingers moving with patient urgency") rather than internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses manifest physically: Kael’s placid mask trembles at memory; the youth’s suffocation eases only through embodied scar-sharing, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines (caution vs mischief), embodied in bolt choice with stinging palm cost. Slight tell in "virtuously mischievous" label prevents 9+; otherwise micro-choices under pressure feel authentic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
