    Elara's motivation shifts from escape to "purpose in the pauses" to transformation, but the contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene—they alternate as clean epiphanies. The ledger decision arrives through declarative realization ("She would not destroy... She would transform") rather than micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "bruised back," "scraped raw," but interiority leans heavily on elevated abstractions ("drifting resonance," "annealed") that flatten particularity. The final stance feels authored rather than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the tuning fork ritual, but her interior landscape remains somewhat abstract—grief as "indigo swirls" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Liam's entrance creates a credible crucible, and his magenta-to-rose shift earns the closure moment, though the transformation feels slightly telescoped. The piece avoids therapy-speak in peak beats, but some interiority ("her heart clenched in recognition") relies on stock phrasing. The final renunciation of noise for deeper resonance is earned, with visible cost in the acceptance of permanent silence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his vow to give rest a permanent address drives the arc. However, the "inadvertently stubborn" trait is labeled rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—he simply acts on instinct with no visible internal tension. Embodiment is present ("fingers tightened," "breath caught") but leans toward stock gestures. The final transformation from weariness to triumph is asserted more than earned through a visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and her "gently persistent" method is demonstrated through the midnight runs. The pairing of Lin and Lena shows micro-choices that serve the collective goal, and the bell-ringing decision at closure embodies her values. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she never wavers or faces a competing impulse that would deepen her arc. The secondary characters (Lin, Lena) apply pressure but remain instruments of Elara's vision rather than agents with conflicting needs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The "healing" sequence proceeds without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she performs the ritual flawlessly with no impulse to abandon or doubt it. The past-life memory and sailor's regret are told rather than lived through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. The final transformation from seeker to "active compassion" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear but remain largely static. Her quest is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the internal arc moves from grief to acceptance via mystical intervention rather than choice under pressure. Embodiment is present ("fingers trailing hedges," "sob escaped") but peak emotional moments lean toward label-speak ("trembling reverie," "quaking in her soul transformed"). The final shift feels granted by the garden's magic rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated (planting resilience) and her twelve-year vigilance establishes commitment, but her interior life is largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The moment she feels the manacle "loosen its symbolic grip" (256) reads as label-only epiphany without friction. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; the arrow retrieval and wall-press unfold without hesitation or cost that would reveal competing impulses. The piece tells us she is patiently strategic but does not dramatize an internal trade-off or mistake that would ground that trait in lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is highly abstract and reflective rather than embodied under pressure. The dominant motivation—"to find the sound of trust breaking"—remains declarative and never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost on the page. Her action (placing the coil, pouring absences) proceeds without friction or internal contradiction; the tear and epiphany arrive without earned struggle. The BRR load exceeds 30% without interleaved on-page choices that alter present options, flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("press her ear against destiny's door") rather than embodied contradiction. The turning point—reading the moonbeam-revealed code—feels more like receiving information than wrestling with conflicting impulses. The final choice to walk the forest path is framed as confident resolution without visible internal cost or foreclosed alternative. Emotional progression from "thief of fleeting beauty" to "participant in its creation" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—to craft safe zones after personal loss—but the emotional progression leans heavily on abstract reflection ("fortress against grief," "the world was thawing, and so was she") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The micro-choice to abandon the flawed piece and restart shows agency, but the decision feels preordained by the bookmark's wisdom rather than emerging from genuine internal conflict. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("release is not defeat," "weighty lightness") that distances rather than grounds the emotional stakes. The final stance—"learned to abandon only what no longer served the light"—reads as epiphany delivered rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and she makes choices under pressure, but internal contradictions remain largely sequential rather than simultaneous. The phobia is declared but never embodied in moment-to-moment perception or physical degradation; it's told as "screamed to flee" without the claustrophobic sensory collapse that would charge her decision to stay. The final epiphany ("vulnerability is power") arrives as label-speak rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Lily functions primarily as a plot catalyst rather than applying pressure that forces Elara into trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to map silence is clearly established and her obsessive focus drives the stylus work forward. However, the piece offers primarily observation and execution without genuine internal conflict or a constraining choice with visible cost. The trait "mildly obsessed" is invoked but never complicates a decision or forecloses an option. The ending delivers completion rather than a renunciation or transformation earned by prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit Seven's motivational arc is clearly signaled: seeking the origin of thought. However, the "remarkably composed" attribute is label-only until late, and the robot's micro-choices feel programmatic rather than showing genuine internal conflict. The amalgamation epiphany arrives through summary rather than dramatized struggle with contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallization—peaceful acceptance—feels asserted rather than earned through visible tradeoffs that foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's core motivation (thaw mistrust via transparency) is clear and drives her nightly ritual, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("quiet fire," "radical transparency") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The pivotal choice to project Kael's symbols is framed as ethical imperative ("passive observation was complicity") without dramatizing internal conflict or cost—she acts from conviction, not torn impulse. Kael's emotional arc (isolation → wonder → acceptance) reads cleanly but his single tear and nod function as emotional summary rather than embodied struggle. The piece favors thematic declaration over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation is clear and her method coherent, but interiority leans heavily toward abstractions ("quiet but fierce," "mended deception") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The marble-polishing ritual embodies persistence, yet the confrontation with Kael resolves too tidily—his panic and flight feel thin, lacking the messy cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path with visible weight. The phoenix vine choice carries some embodied emotion, but the final beats drift toward thematic summary ("wordless covenant") instead of dramatizing the flawed, specific struggle that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation (proving time moves sideways) is clearly established and drives his actions, but the interior work leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "mechanically warm precision" and similar phrases function more as lyric labels than concrete behavioral constraints that force difficult micro-choices. Dr. Aris appears only in brief framing moments, so relationship pressure remains minimal. The final tears and trembling hands gesture toward change, but the arc reads more as validation than transformation earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his obsession drives him through the water nightly, but his interior life remains somewhat static—he traces, understands, plays, without meaningful internal contradiction or cost that evolves his stance. The decision to play the phrase twice feels more like completing a ritual than a choice that forecloses a path with visible psychological price. Embodied detail is present (calloused fingers, damp palm) but the emotional register stays reverent throughout without degradation under stress or competing impulses. The ghost interaction lacks friction; Elias receives and complies rather than wrestling with doubt or fear that would deepen his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is richly drawn with embodied contradictions—the fever-sharpened perception versus her engineered fault-tolerance creates genuine tension. The shift from arrogant oracle to grief-aware witness is earned through the smudge discovery, though the final transformation reads slightly too complete for the compressed timeframe. Micro-choices (leaning close, breath fogging the page, the tear falling) effectively anchor abstract remorse in physical action. The "swallowed truth" metaphor does some heavy thematic lifting that borders on diagnostic label-speak but remains grounded in her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's motivations are clear and intensify appropriately, driven by his grandfather's confession. The shift from "reckless explorer" to someone seeking truth shows progression with cost. However, the grandfather's backstory—delivered entirely through reflection at the beaded wheel—feels convenient rather than layered through contradictory impulses. The final tear and resolve read clean but lack the friction of competing desires acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to witness transformation is established early, but her agency is purely observational—she makes no decisions under pressure. The "loose grip on reality" remains a label without dramatized cost or contradiction; perceiving "whispers of long-dead scholars as tangibly as the damp chill" never complicates a choice. The journey to the refuge and return are described but not earned through conflict, and the final inscription feels like summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority consists largely of abstract reverence ("honored with serene presence") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "softly adaptive" approach is demonstrated through mirroring breath and non-verbal invitation. The baby hair curl functions as both personal anchor and therapeutic tool, showing micro-choices under pressure. However, the protagonist's internal contradiction is minimal—she executes her method smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses. Liam's transformation feels swift and inevitable rather than earned through visible friction; the eclipse does most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The historian's "sensitively perceptive" attribute is mostly label-driven; we're told he "felt the faint resonance" and his fingers trace "the writer's trembling hope," but these remain asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final "smile faintly" gesture and the decision to inscribe Elara's words are present, but they don't foreclose a live option or reveal internal contradiction acting in scene. Motivation is consistent but never tested by competing goods; he simply continues his established work without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas's motivation to reconcile with Elara is clear and drives the orchestration attempt, and his internal state shows layered guilt ("the weight of the open secret"). The accidentally prophetic trait is label-only until the end; it's declared rather than shown constraining his choices during the cookie-making scene. Embodied emotion is present in "tears blurred his vision" and "breath catching," but the interiority leans toward stock phrasing in places ("motivation burned clear," "transpose…into a new key"). The final renunciation—vulnerability over manipulation—is earned, but the arc feels compressed; Elara's arrival before seeing the microdot undercuts the cost of his elaborate plan.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his method (rhetorical probing) is consistent, but his interiority remains abstract—we see the technique more than the man. Elara's arc from cobalt isolation to spectrum acceptance is earned through on-page micro-choices (the palette latch, squeezing crimson), and her embodied trembling and tears ground the possession threat. The therapeutic language ("hidden assumptions," "safety lay in reduction") edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, triggering a modest penalty. The final choice to mix paints feels motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in the shattered assumption.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly articulated and her ritual methodology gives concrete expression to abstract longing. The mapping process shows deliberate micro-choices (stone-skipping to outer curve, kitchen warmth deeper within), but the emotional arc resolves too smoothly—the "chronological homesickness" transforms into "purposeful joy" without sufficient on-page struggle or foreclosed paths. Internal contradiction is largely absent; she succeeds at her process without meaningful resistance from exhaustion, doubt, or the fragility she herself names. The final pivot to fortune cookies feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior state is described extensively but remains abstract—"gravity defier by necessity and sorrow" and "labyrinth of self" function as thematic labels rather than embodied contradictions. The choice to release the tablet arrives suddenly after 73 prior failures with no visible on-page micro-choice that earns the shift; the whisper "What if you forgave yourself?" feels like an external prompt rather than an internal reckoning. Emotions are named ("quiet desperation," "crushing weight") but not embodied through sensation or gesture that would ground them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (defeating numbness) is clear and her transformation at closure is visible, but the journey feels overly smooth. The breakthrough arrives through passive reception rather than a choice under competing pressures—she sits, receives vibration, and numbness dissolves without internal friction or a visible price paid in the moment. Kael remains a wise facilitator without contradiction or a stake of his own. The ending forecloses numbness but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized: no scene shows what she must now give up or endure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's arc from vigilance to "anchoring" is clean, with embodied fear ("frayed edges of vigilance") transitioning to purposeful calm. Her methodology and thirty-year expertise are shown through micro-choices (logging normalcy, encoding the cipher), and the final renunciation of flight for lateral progress is earned. Internal contradiction is present but muted—her fear dissolves perhaps too tidily into resolve without sustained embodied tension in the climax. The choice to send Nimbus again with encoded truth feels credible but lacks a visible cost that would elevate the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's motivation (discover time's texture) drives the accumulation, and his "ethically playful" nature enables the third-path solution at closure. However, the trait reads as label-only until the final turn; we see him "often turn that dilemma over" in summary rather than wrestling with it in real time. The renunciation at the end is earned by prior setup but lacks embodied contradiction in the middle beats. Internal conflict remains abstract ("motivation warred with ethics") rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's acoustically perceptive nature is asserted but not shown constraining choices under pressure. Her motivation "to find beauty in the unfinished" is told repeatedly rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The violin performance moment offers embodied action (arm aching, tears), but the emotional arc moves smoothly from grief to awe without contradictory layers or genuine cost. No meaningful internal conflict appears; she executes her ritual without struggle or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior life is specific—static electricity as emotional epistemology—but his transformation from detachment to empathy reads too smooth, more summary than struggle. The choice to subsume rather than sell is signaled early ("his deeper motivation persisted: to fuse insight with empathy"), reducing the climax to execution of a preset goal rather than a hard-won turn. Embodiment is present ("Unbidden tears traced warm paths down his dust-streaked cheeks") but the shift from decades of detachment to raw exposure lacks visible internal friction or credible cost. Elara remains a functional label without dimensionality, her grief imported wholesale into Kael's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to honor Elara is well-rooted in a prior memory (the child soloist moment), and his shift from transactional cargo work to "logistics of the soul" shows internal progression. However, the interiority leans toward label-speak ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") rather than embodied contradiction, and the peak decision to write a note feels low-stakes—no visible cost or competing impulse complicates the choice. Liam's arc is thin; he functions primarily as exposition delivery. The "compassion multiplies" line borders on thematic summary rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc from rootless to rooted is coherent, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The partnership with Kael feels telescoped—decades of his solitude dissolve in a single tear without visible struggle or cost that complicates the bond. The final choice to dedicate the arbor is signaled early and proceeds without friction, reading more as fulfillment than a decision under competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the quest, but her interiority leans heavily on declarative exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The emotional climax—tears streaming as she hears her mother's lullaby—reads as label-only sentiment without prior embodied micro-choices that earn the moment. Her illustrator's precision is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or complicates her success; competence faces no genuine struggle. The final choice to illustrate the echo lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths—she succeeded cleanly and will continue her work enriched, which skirts Earned Stasis requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific (understand the mathematics of emotion), and her method is character-particular (gentle alignment vs. force). However, interiority leans heavily abstract—"the mathematics of emotion" recurs as label rather than embodied contradiction. The final tear "carried no bitterness—only the weight of understanding" reads as summary emotion rather than lived conflict. Her renunciation of active searching is earned, but the arc lacks genuine struggle or mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her methodical nature shows in concrete actions (rope ladder, practiced care). The final choice to step into visibility is earned by the prior caching action and years of hidden observation. However, interiority relies heavily on sense-memory blocks rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the present scene. The embodied emotion at the climax ("heart pounding a gentle, hopeful rhythm") verges on decorative rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's shift from control to acceptance is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (returning the linden leaf, leaving bent branches, planting hostas), and her interiority shows embodied emotion ("tear traced soil on her cheek"). However, the emotional progression leans toward summary in places ("felt both sacred and solitary"), and the epiphany arrives too cleanly without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The "circuitously sincere" trait is claimed but not demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" drives concrete choices—following rain trails, the brooch exchange, painting with clarity—and his insomnia functions as earned endurance rather than decoration. Interior perception is specific ("haggard awe of survival," grinding pigments) and embodied. The final sleep is earned by prior causality (seventeen years awake, vigil fulfilled), creating visible cost. Minor: Anya's memory remains summary-told rather than fully dramatized, and Elara's appearance leans slightly toward convenience despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is told through exposition ("her motivation was compassion itself") rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("magnify the everyday magic") and label-only emotion ("sharp anxiety") without embodied specificity. The pilgrim remains a passive prop with no agency; Elara's climactic "choice" is to close her eyes and "pour love," which lacks visible cost or internal conflict. The final shift from anxiety to "quiet joy" arrives without earned causality or a forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to compile fragments is clear and her reactively visionary trait is shown through the trumpet vision, but her interiority leans toward label-speak ("reactively visionary," "gift and burden") rather than embodied contradiction. The restoration work provides concrete micro-choices, yet the ending epiphany with Elder Lin feels somewhat tidy—"profound warmth bloomed" and "quiet certainty" lack the ambiguity or felt cost that would elevate the final stance. The vision sequence is vivid, but the emotional progression from gasping stumble to certainty bypasses messier internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established and sustained, but interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("quiet desperation," "emotional armor") rather than embodied contradiction. The surrender of the map is motivated, but the transformation feels declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final tear and "buoyant lightness" read as emotional summary without the messy irrationality or competing impulses that would ground the shift. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending grants wholeness without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "sympathetic skeptic" nature is established early and her mentor's prior influence shapes her choice to use the tile. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("courageously kind impulse," "skeptic's mind cataloged absurdities") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivot to transcription feels prompted by compassion for Liam but lacks visible internal cost or struggle—she moves from skepticism to tears without dramatized resistance. The final stance is declared rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kaelen's motivation is told rather than dramatized through embodied choices under pressure. His interiority is abstract ("quiet, burning quest," "fragile ember") and relies on summary rather than concrete micro-decisions. The final transformation ("tears, the first in ten thousand years") feels unearned—no prior beats establish what specific internal contradiction this resolves. No secondary character appears on the page to test him, so all relationship and status bullets are inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior world is specific to her history as a con artist's child, with concrete micro-choices (insisting on preparing the body herself, writing *What is fair?*). Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous rebellion against and honoring of her father's complexity. However, key emotional beats rely on label-speak ("suffocating legacy," "profound peace") rather than fully embodied sensation, and the final shift toward ethical consulting feels more announced than organically wrestled through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "earnestly studious nature" drives the charting ritual, but interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The invented histories show devotion, yet no on-page choice tests competing impulses or forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in physical details (tracing the notepad, filtering sounds), but the final walk toward the cottage offers continuity without a stance-altering decision that demonstrates internal contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is vivid and particular—"quiet, persistent hunger to discover the texture of memories" grounds motivation in sensory archaeology rather than generic redemption. However, the character remains largely an observer-archivist without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his reverence for fragments never conflicts with another need or fear that would create genuine internal friction. The final choice to continue collecting is consistent but not earned through a dramatized cost that forecloses a live alternative. Embodied emotion is present ("bones aching with damp cold") but the piece leans heavily on lyric reflection rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode her grandfather's riddle is clear and personal, but her "myth buster" profession never constrains a choice or creates friction with her quest—it's label-only. Her attribute of "reimagining past conversations with cinematic clarity" appears as a told gift rather than earning embodied cost; the reimagined dialogue at the climax reads more like convenient recall than a strained retrieval under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from grief to resolution without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's role as "culture shock absorber" is asserted more than enacted through contradictory choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("orderly intuitive," "dual allegiance") rather than embodied contradiction in high-pressure moments. The graffiti work shows some micro-choices, but the foundation stone chip functions primarily as a comfort object rather than constraining decisions. Elara and the community respond predictably without status friction or misalignment that would test Kael's mediator role.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy; the opening establishes purposeful curiosity and the promise to his grandfather drives the vigil. Interiority is mostly concrete ("waves of grief that threatened to overwhelm his resolve"), though "purposefully curious nature" reads as a label rather than dramatized trait. The final choice to descend is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the crater will not outlast the day). However, Kael remains largely observer rather than actor; no on-page contradiction or mistake complicates his path, and the peak emotional beat leans toward abstraction ("dawnlit melancholy settled deep into Kael's bones") rather than embodied particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her tactile mastery is well-embodied through sensory particulars. However, her agency operates entirely without friction or internal contradiction—she executes a repair with unbroken calm and no moment where competence wavers or competing impulses surface. The final satisfaction is declared rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation; she ends precisely where she began, making the arc more demonstration than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and purposeful—her dry wit anchors the high-stakes revelation. The motivation (finding river origins as rebellion against symptom-mapping) is clear and drives choices. However, the protagonist's journey is largely observational rather than decisional until the final commitment to drill, which arrives late and feels more like stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses competing paths with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from curiosity to confirmation without sufficient friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her attribute of "infinite patience" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The action sequence shows deliberate choices (footfall patterns, rhythm shifts), but her interiority remains largely label-driven ("her patience held firm") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The piece tells us she feels "tremors of the looming collapse" yet no micro-choice reveals cost or hierarchy of values—she simply proceeds. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she executes a plan without visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through the crystal vial and Elena's memory, with internal contradiction evident in the tension between panic and meditative patience. The oxygen alarm provides concrete pressure that forces micro-choices. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("profound peace," "lonesome splendor") rather than purely embodied perception. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("thread this stone labyrinth with his own story") rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice—pressing the lattice to the scuffs—is purposeful, but Kael's emotional progression remains smooth and didactic; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the peak beat. Elias's shift from skepticism to belief is motivated but arrives without visible struggle or cost beyond a single tear.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ghost bride's motivation is clearly signaled (repaying a debt across lifetimes), but her actions remain largely atmospheric rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory consumes significant space (~35% of word count) and while it anchors present action, the choices on the page are predetermined by the vow rather than shaped by internal conflict. The final dissolution reads as fulfillment rather than renunciation with visible cost—she achieves exactly what she sought without foreclosing a meaningful alternative path. Interiority leans toward decorative phrasing ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous") that labels rather than embodies contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early and drives the sewing action, but her interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("hauntingly optimistic," "fierce hope," "profound peace"). The sleepwalking backstory anchors her method but reads as exposition rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final choice—tying thread to the orchid—feels predetermined by the sleepwalking convergence rather than earned by on-page struggle. Embodied emotion appears in tears and calloused fingers, but the peak beats lack genuine flaws or mistakes that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (restore lost faith) is clear and her actions follow logically, but her interior life relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("the weight of interrupted journeys," "cautious enchantment") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation from exile to willing participant reads as asserted through repeated metaphors rather than earned through a specific on-page cost that forecloses a prior path. Embodied emotion is sparse; the tear at noon is the sole physical marker in a narrative dominated by lyric summary.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal state is handled mostly through static description and label-only traits ("carefully inventive," "quiet renown") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The clipboard attachment and pseudonym work feel ornamental rather than arising from embodied need. The chalk-code revelation produces tears but the emotional progression lacks credible irrationality or cost—she simply adopts "Aurora" without friction. The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality; "Lyra" and "Corbin" are discarded via assertion, not dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early and her "disguises wisdom as foolishness" trait is visible in the placid smile / sharp intelligence contrast. Internal contradiction appears (dread vs. steady hands at line 180), though the patron-dismissal beat lacks embodied emotion—we're told she feels concern but don't see hesitation or physical tells. The ending renunciation (delivering truth via proxy rather than confrontation) forecloses the direct-action path with implied cost, meeting the Earned Stasis threshold, but the choice feels predetermined by trait rather than emerging from on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation (seeking healing for unspoken regret) is clear and consistent, but his interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing: "noose of pride and fear," "decade of grief." The pivotal moment—witnessing Lena's forgiveness in the condensation—feels more told than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Elara functions primarily as a guide rather than applying secondary pressure; her presence channels rather than complicates. The ending grants Kael healing without visible cost or path foreclosed on the page, reading as relief rather than renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Anahera's interiority is consistently rendered through the brain coral fragment as tactile anchor and her translator's lens applied to Leo's cast. Her motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" shapes her decryption work and generates micro-choices (leaning closer, whispering comfort). However, the internal arc relies heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the camp-boy memory and grandmother's wisdom arrive as backstory rather than live pressure. The final whispered declaration feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (rediscovering lost joy) is clear and her pilgrimage is purposeful, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract states ("pensive mirth," "quiet ache") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The daydream sequence blurs agency—she observes memories rather than making choices under pressure. The final "integration" of the fragment reads as ritual completion without a trade-off that forecloses another path with visible cost. The character is consistent but lacks the internal friction and micro-choice density needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority is label-heavy and therapy-speak pervades the peak beats: "sacred, breathless suspension," "bewitchment," "perception expanding like a blooming flower," "confronted her own motivation." The nested awakenings—three distinct revelations—are told rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The final "choice" to exchange certainty for curiosity is asserted in exposition ("she consciously chose") without visible cost or foreclosed options dramatized on the page. Motivation remains abstract; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation ("to stand guard over his own spark of defiance") is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "psychic intrusion" backstory tells us his wound but doesn't translate into on-page micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Dr. Petrova remains functional support with no interior contradiction. The final "spark…blazed into a beacon" moment asserts transformation without showing the cost of that leap.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied longing across centuries and the alchemy of pain-to-verse clearly motivating his existence. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—centuries pass in reflection without micro-choices under pressure until the shell resonates, and that shift arrives through external magic rather than an earned internal contradiction forcing a decision. The final "surrender" reads as received grace rather than a choice with visible cost. Label-speak like "blossom armistice" and "reef-shadow joy" occasionally abstract the emotional stakes when concrete embodiment would sharpen them.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but her interior remains generic and label-driven ("foxglove regret," "profound connection"). The piece tells us she feels devotion and gratitude rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. A single tear and murmured dialogue do not constitute embodied emotion under pressure; the protagonist performs reverence without cost or genuine struggle. The final stance feels stated, not earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (restore trust after ninety-seven days of silence) is clearly established and drives her actions throughout. The attribute "carefully reckless" appears as a label but isn't dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her choices read as methodical rather than torn. The emotional progression from desperation to relief to renewal is linear and somewhat therapeutic ("tears of relief traced warm paths down her cheeks") without the irrational layering or self-deception that would deepen interiority. Kael's transformation from rigid to tearful feels abrupt; his change lacks intermediate beats that would earn the softening.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—harmonizing Guild reverence with Collective need—and his engineered solution shows agency. However, interiority remains largely illustrative rather than contradictory; his hands tremble "not with fear, but with the profound weight of connection" over-explains rather than embodies internal friction. The climactic choice feels inevitable from the architect's cipher forward, limiting genuine struggle. Elara and Borin appear only to validate the outcome, not to pressure Kael's stance in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve echoes and his contradiction between hiding/revealing are established, but interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("grief, sharp as the meteorite's edge"). The final choice to write truth and show Clara carries visible cost but arrives through lengthy reflection rather than embodied pressure. Micro-choices are present (lowering the meteorite, turning to blank page) yet feel orchestrated by theme rather than urgent need. The cooing pigeon at the end tests his stance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The internal experience remains abstract—"featherly determined resolve," "quiet ache"—without embodied emotion or visible micro-choices under pressure. The tear at the end is the sole physical marker, but acceptance arrives without dramatized struggle or foreclosed paths. No meaningful change occurs; she completes a pilgrimage to understanding without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("resonance between a breath and a star") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mentor's voice and firefly memory supply motivation, but the protagonist's arc from isolation to belonging reads as stated insight rather than earned through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. Emotional progression is summarized ("tears traced clean paths") instead of dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final release of the feather gestures toward change, but the decision lacks the grinding trade-off or foreclosed path that would make it decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her testing actions with the crater glass, showing contradictory impulses (hope vs. sorrow). Her internal progression from investigator to witness has emotional logic, and the final tears-with-smile carries earned complexity. However, the epiphany moment ("paths vanished not from erasure, but from completion") arrives through observation rather than a micro-choice under pressure, and the climactic realizations feel somewhat delivered rather than fought for. The "cheerful gloom" framing device slightly over-articulates her emotional state rather than letting contradiction speak through action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corbin's motivation is clearly established—using calculated placement to create serendipity for solitary souls. The elderly man's transformation from stooped grief to lighter steps shows concrete change, though his interior remains opaque. The piece leans heavily on Corbin's analytical methodology but his emotional stakes feel somewhat distant; we see process more than vulnerability. The final validation ("warmth spreading through his chest") reads earned but the lack of genuine risk or internal contradiction keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early (to pen a cosmic verse) and her tide-dancer expertise is established, but her interior life operates at too elevated a register throughout—"obsidian grace," "gravitational pull," "purpose was rooted here" read as authorial assertion rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's trust and awe are told more than shown; his storm of impending departure never manifests as a micro-choice that tests competing impulses. The final "spirit begin to fledge" moment is declared rather than earned through on-page friction, and no mistake or blind spot complicates Elara's flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied (stone handling, kneeling, dampness in knees), but her motivation remains abstract throughout—"to illuminate value in the mundane" never faces a live on-page test or contradiction. The reckoning crystallizes insights about her work, yet no foreclosed path or visible cost emerges; she simply returns to the workshop with renewed purpose. Internal conflict is absent; she experiences contemplation without competing impulses, making her journey feel more like meditation than struggle. The micro-choices (tossing the stone, reading the rings) are present but carry no stakes or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is anchored by visible scars and a clear goal (carrying the box, translating pain), but the interiority is heavily abstract—"alchemy," "universal language," "hard softness"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "enlightenment" arrives through sustained reflection rather than a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in tactile handling of the box, but the epiphany feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. The protagonist remains competent and resolute throughout, with no genuine mistake or blind spot that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is told ("sole motivation burned quietly within") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Interior experience consists largely of abstract labels ("lucidly watchful state," "serene upheaval") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist performs one ritual action across parallel timelines, but no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the gauge chimes success without dramatized struggle or forfeiture. While the character is present throughout, agency reads as observation plus mechanism rather than decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's sensitively perceptive nature is established early and drives her search, but the interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("souls' echo demanding guardianship") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to discover what walls dream about remains consistent but never faces a genuine test that forces her to renounce or alter her quest—she simply succeeds and deepens her commitment. The final covenant feels declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live alternative. Embodiment is present in sensory details (fingers on stone, tears welling) but emotional progression stays on a single upward arc without credible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The painter exists as a vehicle for the concept rather than a character with interior contradiction or genuine stakes. His "perceptively calm assurance" is declared but never tested by competing impulses; he executes a plan without meaningful resistance or decision cost. The borrowed heartbeat is an interesting device, but its faltering never forces a choice that forecloses a path—he simply sings on. The child at the end appears too late to create relational pressure and reads as thematic closure rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation (redemption through resignation) is clear and his operatively gentle attribute shapes multiple beats. However, the confession "I burned the Vale" arrives as summary exposition rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal contradiction between his gentle approach and violent past never complicates a present choice—it's recounted, then resolved through declaration. The secondary characters (elder, delegate) apply pressure but remain functional props. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (thumb tracing clipboard, tremor in soul) but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("redemption was not absolution") flattens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is embodied through contradictory impulses—ruthless architect yet secret sentimentalist—that drive the pilgrimage with visible cost ("a theft disguised as compassion, heavier than any award"). The trembling fingers and single tear are earned micro-choices that fracture his polished control. Interiority is specific and character-particular (e.g., "morality as fluid, bending to progress"), though the childhood memory block feels slightly inserted rather than woven through present perception. The final renunciation forecloses intimacy with the relic, a credible endurance scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated early ("to harvest the echoes of silenced voices") but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor and stock bodily poetry rather than concrete, contradictory impulses. The untangling task provides physical specificity, yet her internal experience of defiance versus the lullaby's pull is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that expose genuine friction. The final moment ("kinship with every liberated soul") shifts to abstraction when embodied cost would anchor the change. Chastity as "dedication, not denial" is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through concrete details—ink-stained fingers, posture, puppet shows—and his motivation evolves through Lena's critique, which creates internal friction. The epiphany at line 130 ("ethics resided not in reversing a story's moral, but in reversing the storyteller's role") feels somewhat diagnostic and over-articulated for a character mid-crisis. His transformation is enacted through micro-choices (turning the stick horizontally, envisioning the new setup), but the serenity trait remains more asserted than embodied under pressure. The trajectory from subversive control to witness/transcriber is clear, though the final paragraphs lean toward summary of future intent rather than present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (honoring overlooked histories) is clear, but her interiority reads as conceptual meditation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision to splint the butterfly's wing is sudden and kind, yet it doesn't emerge from internal conflict—the action feels generous rather than earned through struggle. Embodied emotion is scarce; "transiently rooted in awe" and similar phrases label states rather than showing perception degrade or contradict itself. The final walk carries resolution, but no visible path was foreclosed with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—preserving forgotten names—is concrete and drives the sanctum sequence. Her technically gentle hands are shown in action (loosening braids, translating perforations), and the lost-wax-caster philosophy provides a character-particular lens. However, interiority leans on abstract phrases ("snowmelt ardor," "hard-won peace") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final emotional release ("tears traced warm paths") edges toward performed sentiment without complicating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's affliction (foresight/hindsight, no present) is asserted but her choices feel inevitable rather than driven by contradictory impulses. The final "transcendence" arrives through a mystical artifact rather than earned internal struggle; she presses the seal and the problem dissolves. Motivation is told ("to discover why some paths choose their walkers") rather than tested through on-page trade-offs. Embodied emotion is sparse; peak moments default to abstraction ("serene calm," "unwavering clarity") instead of contradictory sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Enlil's motivation is clear and sustained—sealing a covenant through mathematical alignment—but his interior life dissolves into abstract devotion rather than embodied contradiction. The "frugal" trait appears only as lamp-oil measurement and never constrains a meaningful choice under pressure. Emotional states are declared ("warmth flowed," "silent affirmation") rather than dramatically earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The final transformation reads as assertion: "his skepticism had been the very path to grace" lacks the credible struggle or visible cost that would make renunciation or endurance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's transformation from decades of bitterness to release is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "cellular memory" mechanism bypasses genuine internal conflict—his body simply "recalls" joy without on-page resistance that would make the shift credible. Elara remains a static facilitator whose "scheming pacifist" trait is told but never tested by genuine doubt or cost. The therapy-speak ("the courage of releasing what no longer serves") and diagnostic framing flatten what should be embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific—capturing the runaway dream—but her character reads as competent-without-struggle. The synchronized breathing and glass-filament repair proceed smoothly without meaningful error or hesitation; her "quiet certainty" never wavers under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent: no competing impulse complicates her actions, and the astronomer's broken sextant is fixed through patient technique rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The final image promises renewal (the bud on the pear tree) but offers no evidence that Elara herself has paid a price or changed.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to bridge generational wisdom is declared but her interior contradiction remains abstract—she "felt an endearingly feisty resolve kindle" rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ribbon memory triggers embodied emotion ("A lump tightened Elara's throat"), yet the pivotal repair choice feels inevitable rather than costly; no on-page trade-off between competing goods. Lyra's arrival and reconciliation land emotionally but bypass genuine friction: the daughter immediately grasps the mother's intent without residual conflict, flattening what could have been a harder-won closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her trembling fingers embody early tension, but her breakthrough arrives via contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The bathroom ritual feels like stated habit rather than lived conflict. The final choice to kneel and offer respect is emotionally coherent but lacks the internal friction or visible cost that would push this higher—she moves from bewilderment to calm without meaningful resistance or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses; her "carefully resourceful" trait is label-only until the late honesty beat. The Warden encounter offers one moment of genuine agency when she voices her fear, sprouting the vine, but most beats—describing gaps, interpreting Kael's trembling—read as observation rather than high-cost choice. Kael's dissolution is told more than shown, limiting relational pressure. Interior voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("symphony of ancient forests contemplating change") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation (to find the garden of forgotten names and recapture Kael's essence) is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("fundamental fracture in her own being") and summary over embodied contradiction. The final renunciation (releasing the emerald card) is legible but arrives via an expository journal entry rather than dramatized internal conflict; the "unkindled solace" realization reads as told insight rather than earned struggle. The "blissfully aberrant" attribute is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—her whispering to mannequins and placing wildflowers are described, not shown as tactical decisions under pressure. Reflection dominates without enough on-page micro-choices that tilt present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated ("to translate confusion into clarity") but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels rather than embodied contradiction. The character performs a series of methodical actions without visible internal conflict or struggle—she "understood," "felt," "took," "secured" in smooth progression. Her "warmly methodical nature" functions as a told trait rather than a constraint that creates friction. The closure choice (weaving the rope) feels procedurally executed rather than wrestled from competing impulses with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is visceral and embodied early ("soul-deep imperative," frantic heat of the stone), and the final choice to turn the stone inward rather than project outward shows agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (duty versus desperation), and the climactic act of listening rather than projecting is earned. However, the resolution reads as fairly tidy—the stone's "frantic buzz ceased" without much visible struggle or cost in the moment, and the tear at the end feels like emotional release rather than a complication that persists.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly signaled and her thirty-year commitment tracked through concrete detail (brass astrolabes, charcoal sketches). Her retrocognitive ability produces vivid micro-moments but her choices feel largely predetermined by the lore she follows rather than generated by internal contradiction. The peak action—angling the prism and placing the shard—reads as execution of instructions from Master Aris rather than a stake-raising decision under competing pressures. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (tears at the end) but much of the interiority relies on abstract "thistle-blown hope" and "unshakable certainty" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is rooted in her archival role, but interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "preemptive nostalgia → resolve" arc is signaled rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; the pivot feels declared ("bold conjecture ignited") rather than earned by competing desires. Embodied emotion is present (tears, throat tightening) but the final transformation lacks visible cost—she writes and is accepted without forfeit. The journey reads more as meditative confirmation than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her physical interaction with the knot demonstrates agency, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The journey from hopelessness to resolve reads as a smooth arc without genuine internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her chanting practice and ambient awareness function more as mystical tools than as character-particular habits that reveal flaws or force mistakes under pressure. The final choice to spread her design is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's observant nature is embodied through concrete gestures (thumb tracing jade, gaze tracking hermit crab) that lead to a choice—speaking from shared memory rather than blame. Internal motivation is clearly tied to "discovering texture of time," not winning arguments. However, the final turn feels more like patient waiting validated than a choice with visible cost; Kael's shift arrives rather than being earned through Elara's agency. Micro-choices are present but the decisive moment lacks sufficient friction or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and quest for silence are clearly motivated by her father's legacy, but the interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("bone-deep claustrophobia," "phantom pressure") rather than immediate embodied sensation during the weightless moment. The peak beat—dissolving claustrophobia in gilded hush—reads as therapeutic epiphany delivered through contemplative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The porcelain doll's transformation from confinement token to witness of release is earned, but the emotional progression feels calibrated and tidy rather than credibly irrational under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated early and shapes her actions, but her interiority reads more as mechanism than contradiction—she is a patient teacher throughout with no internal conflict or cost. Leo's grief is embodied through physical tension and his progression from rigidity to tears to tentative smile is tracked, but the arc feels linear rather than layered with competing impulses. The grandmother detail arrives late as convenient backstory to unlock emotion rather than complicating a present choice. Elara's fluidly logical precision is mentioned but never tested by failure or doubt, limiting the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in decades of study, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("wisely adventurous," "reverence") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The peeling sequence shows methodical action but lacks genuine internal conflict or blind spots that complicate her choices. Her epiphany at the end—"the unclaimed throne was never meant for sitting"—arrives as a stated realization rather than emerging from embodied struggle or prior misbelief dramatized on the page. The final pivot away from ascension feels thematically imposed rather than earned by character-specific friction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "teach suffocating things how to breathe" is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The core choice—linking through scars rather than opening the door—carries conceptual weight, but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("empathy for fragility," "suffocating despair") that distances us from embodied emotion. The final renunciation (not opening the door) reads as Earned Stasis, but the path there feels more allegorical than psychologically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (pressure-to-diamonds alchemy) is clear and drives her forward to volunteer, but her internal contradictions remain abstract. The "virtuously mischievous" attribute appears twice—once as backstory (spore constellations) and once as present urging—but neither moment forces a trade-off or reveals competing impulses acting simultaneously. The bolt functions more as symbolic anchor than a choice-shaping constraint; her grip tightens and she whispers "a key," yet no on-page micro-choice tests that resolve against another want. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("deep-sea weight," "crushing pressure") rather than embodied, character-particular contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is textured through sensory engagement with memory and objects. However, her internal life relies heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("eloquently silent," "dynasty ender") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic discovery feels achieved through inheritance and puzzle-solving rather than genuine internal conflict that forces a difficult choice with visible cost. The grandfather's voice and the letter provide resolution, but Elara's own agency in the final beat reads more as revelation-receiver than active decider.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's motivation ("to capture the shape of possibility") remains abstract throughout; the story tells us he seeks this but never dramatizes why or what cost he's already paid. The murmured allegiance backstory is recounted, not earned through present contradiction or micro-choice. The final "transformation" from withdrawn to guardian is asserted rather than shown through competing impulses or visible renunciation. Interiority consists largely of poetic labels ("shivering bliss," "radiant openness") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her broken heart filters the work, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The discovery of the button unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or contradiction—she processes grief in perfectly articulated stages. The reflective interiority dominates without embodied struggle; lines like "her sorrow did not deepen; it softened" read as label-only emotional arithmetic. No micro-choice alters her stance; the arc from broken to held is declared rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's core motivation (holding the line against indifference) is clear and shapes her final stance, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied—"quiet, fierce vow" and "spirit unbroken" label states without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to stand and face enforcers reads more as thematic posture than a choice with visible internal cost or foreclosed alternatives. Backstory dominates the first third without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics, flattening pressure until the lagoon sequence begins.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (hushing the prophecy through mercy) is signaled early and drives his journey to the grotto. His method—dissolving prophecy through negative space and intentional silence—shows character-specific competence, and the grandfather's lessons root his approach in lived memory. The final tears and lowering of the instrument after the vested hush descends suggest emotional cost, though the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion appears in "tears traced clean paths through dust" and "breath steady," but peak beats rely on contemplative narration ("He understood—the eerie nostalgia was fuel") rather than immediate somatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interiority is heavily abstracted through repeated phrases like "mossy delight" and "quiet fire warming her spirit" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The transformation claimed in "She emerged transformed always" is told rather than dramatized—no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. The grandmother memory arrives as summary sentiment ("her grandmother's laughter by the hearth") rather than specific sensory contradiction that complicates present action. Internal conflict is absent; Elara moves through a ritual without hesitation, fear, or competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "befriend uncertainty" is signaled early and the waterfall scene embodies her shift from rigid control to "surrender, not force," but the interiority often drifts into abstract therapy-speak ("uncertain certainty settle in her bones") rather than embodied contradiction. The needle-freeing micro-choice demonstrates skill under pressure, yet the epiphany language ("the core concept revealed itself") flattens what should be a visceral realization. The admiral remains off-page, reducing relationship pressure to a transaction. Internal conflict is asserted more than it acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("deep, quiet need," "luminous regret") rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice—pouring starlight over the shards—lacks genuine struggle or competing impulses; she proceeds through a ritualized sequence without visible hesitation or cost that would foreclose another path. The emotional arc moves from guilt to resolution too smoothly, reading as therapeutic progression rather than contradictory forces acting simultaneously. Kael remains an absence rather than a pressure that complicates her present choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her choice to pursue laughter-integration drives the sequence, but her arc lacks internal contradiction—she executes her method smoothly without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a visible path. The specter Cora shows more dynamic range (regret → laughter → dissolution) than the protagonist, whose calm remains undisturbed. Embodiment is present ("crocodile's tooth pressed to her heart") but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "bittersweet weight of release" tells state rather than showing a choice that narrows options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's interiority is saturated with diagnostic label-speak ("proprioceptively enhanced," "Mercy_Coefficient_01," "recursive function") that reads as conceptual exposition rather than embodied crisis. The core motivation—discovering a mathematical framework for mercy—remains abstract; no micro-choice dramatizes the trade-off between mining trauma and preserving sanity. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("displaced yet rooted") but never acts simultaneously in scene. The daughter's laughter arrives as a memory token without altering present stance or foreclosing a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent (honoring Hemlock's overlooked history), but her choices lack meaningful contradiction or cost. The reflective passages dominate—childhood memories anchor present beats without friction—yet no micro-choice forces her to renounce or sacrifice anything on the page. Internal conflict is absent; she moves from fragment to paintings to closure without struggle, rendering the journey observational rather than transformative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's motivation is clear and his skillfully observant trait manifests in concrete choices (analyzing dust patterns, finding the hidden seam). However, the emotional arc feels frictionless—he encounters no genuine internal conflict or cost in his ghost-helping mission. The ghost Elias is well-rendered with embodied sorrow, but Leo's calm presence and compassionate stillness read as competence without vulnerability. The final vow to find Clara carries narrative weight but isn't earned through on-page struggle or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—compressing eternity—but her interiority is abstract and label-driven ("profound motivation," "quiet certainty") rather than embodied. Internal conflict is absent; she proceeds through her task without contradictory impulses or struggle beyond generic "strain in her bones." The final choice lacks visible cost: the library evolves, but no personal forfeiture or difficult trade-off is dramatized. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are largely missing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "sacred duty" reads as a declared trait rather than a lived struggle; no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or pay a visible personal cost. The tears at vindication and the final pedestal placement feel performed rather than embodied. Kaelen exists only in reflective summary, never pressuring Elara's present choices with friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's internal life is delivered almost entirely through abstract labels ("supernatural gentleness," "fragile attribute," "deep peace") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The wilt is described but not felt: we're told it drains color and slackens posture, yet during the climactic turn the prose offers "tears of strain" and "knuckles white"—generic physical markers that could attach to any crisis. His motivation ("to reclaim the light") is declared but never tested by a competing want or fear that would create authentic tension. The final "exhausted yet filled with abiding peace" reads like emotional summary rather than a lived internal shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait (seeking thresholds beyond explanation), and the final renunciation (leaving the compass, refusing a sample) is earned by the psychometry vision. However, the awakening arrives via received wisdom from Thorne rather than her own contradictory struggle; she accepts his epiphany wholesale without visible internal friction. Embodied emotion is present ("tears tracing clean paths") but the interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("wonder begins precisely where explanation ends") rather than character-particular sensation. The choice to surrender feels thematically mandated rather than wrested from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly detailed but leans heavily on label-speak: "scaffold complexity with simplicity," "timewoven alliances," "reimagine her isolation." Her motivation is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses under pressure. The carving sequence embodies action, but the peak choice—to carve without sketches—feels more meditative than conflicted, lacking visible cost or foreclosed path. Anya's remembered voice provides texture, yet the character reads more as archetype (wise sculptor seeking foundational wisdom) than individual with blind spots or mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final understanding feels earned through the glass revelation. However, the character remains largely contemplative rather than conflicted; her "quietly driven" patience never faces a meaningful counterpressure or cost that would test her commitment. The grandmother exists only in memory and marginalia, limiting relational crucible work. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") rather than embodied contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—uncovering suppressed history—but his interior life reads abstract rather than embodied. The retrocognitive experience offers vivid action, yet his emotional processing ("tears streamed," "profound relief") leans on summary labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to write is declared rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the "archival certainty" arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is heavily dominated by reflection and abstract conceptual language ("the disciplined architecture of her working memory," "conception was complete") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation is declared coherent and unwavering throughout; no competing impulses complicate the path. The final act of burying the bottle reads as symbolic ceremony rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses an alternative. Emotional progression is tidy—solitude transforms into purpose without messy friction or real trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to archive emotional patterns is established early and drives her immersion attempt, but her agency is largely passive—she receives the memory rather than forcing a choice under pressure. The shift from archiving to cultivation at the end reads as realization rather than a decision with visible cost or foreclosed path. Interior texture is strong ("iron-gall ink," "gnarled fingers") but the epiphany arrives without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character endures and accepts rather than struggles, landing this in earned-stasis territory without the friction that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—discovering the "texture of borrowed time"—but her choices feel predetermined by the ritual rather than earned through internal contradiction. The piece leans heavily on label-speak ("furiously tranquil") and abstract interiority ("legacy," "sacred exchange") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression is missing; she moves through the ritual without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a live option. The final smile and step into dawn read as affirmed satisfaction rather than a choice weighted by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior life is grounded in decades of meticulous observation, and her decision to remain silent carries visible cost ("breeding cynicism where trust should grow"). Her motivation to favor listening over noise is embodied in concrete micro-choices: touching the rope, tasting the air, watching ibex. Minor slip: the phrase "credibly curious mind" reads as a label rather than dramatized trait, and the backstory weight occasionally flatlines present pressure despite anchoring her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's spiritually curious nature is present but operates largely through reflection rather than conflicting impulses acting in scene. The cosmic janitor follows a contemplative arc from solitude to realized connection, but the internal journey unfolds through meditation without the contradictory desires or genuine struggle that would elevate characterization. The final peace settles smoothly without foreclosing a live option with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("sacred space where connection blossomed") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recluse's motivation to preserve unspoken words is established and drives the ritual action, but the character functions primarily as a vehicle for contemplation rather than making choices under pressure. His "tranquilly perceptive" stance remains static—no internal contradiction or struggle emerges. The revelation at "He understood then: the covenant was not a chain of regret, but a bridge completed by his steadfast guardianship" feels declared rather than earned through dramatized conflict. Elias's ghost receives more concrete embodiment (touching hive 'A', lingering near the broken pot) but his loop lacks agency.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his trajectory from borrowed time to dissolution is causally earned. The interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("coarse weave," "silken slide," "gritty dust") rather than embodied contradiction; under peak pressure the texture catalog feels more lyric than dramatized internal conflict. The transition to Elara is clean but her understanding arrives as instant download rather than struggle. The final choice—embedding messages in garage-sale cards—reads more as backstory summary than on-page micro-decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established, but her agency is minimal—she observes, walks, picks up a feather, and writes. The dominant action is contemplation rather than decision under pressure. The transformation from witnessing a snapped kite string to writing verse feels more like an aesthetic exercise than a choice with foreclosed paths or visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("warmly attentive stillness," "reverent care") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through ritual gestures (palm to bark, whispered intent) that show respect as action rather than declaration. Internal contradiction appears subtly in his "brazen calm" masking the terminal diagnosis, and micro-choices under constraint (wire spacing, patient invitation) reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to place the diary in the hollow earns its weight through fifty cumulative years, though the death itself arrives more as fulfillment than struggle—cost is visible but the path feels preordained rather than fought.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation (isolating chemistry of homecoming) is clear and her academically rebellious trait shapes the opening choice to seek the sculpture path. However, her agency weakens in the second half: the footprints lead her passively to the chamber, and the convergence with Elias feels orchestrated rather than earned by her micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous skeptic's unwavering clarity," "quiet defiance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from skepticism to certainty lacks visible cost—no renunciation or foreclosed path is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—his vow to let a garden reclaim the battlefield—but his choices on the page are largely sequential actions rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority leans toward elevated, almost ceremonial language ("his throat tightened," "tears traced clean paths") that reads more as performed emotion than embodied contradiction. The final micro-choice to return tomorrow is stated but not tested by a competing desire or visible cost that forecloses another path. The piece delivers coherent agency but misses the internal friction and embodied complexity required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, but his interior remains static throughout—he traces the leaf each dawn, refuses the job, then solves the riddle without internal conflict testing his retirement vow. The shift from refusal to action happens via memory rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is present ("Tears traced clean paths") but the final choice feels ordained by the prompt rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a living option.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is clear and her motivation to decode her grandfather's disappearance through sketching is established early. However, the character reads as somewhat static—she observes, sketches, and realizes, but makes no difficult choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Her shift from "commemorating loss" to "engaging in dialogue across time" is declarative rather than dramatized through a concrete dilemma. The blessing/curse of her immunity is mentioned but never tests her in a moment of genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation (amending the fracture) is clear and consistent, but his interior remains largely uncontradicted and abstract—"spirit alight," "sacredly playful reverence"—without embodied tension or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The swapping sequence provides micro-choices (which piece to replace next), yet each exchange follows a predictable emotional arc (despair → warmth → tears) without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses options. The climactic moment ("tears froze on Kael's cheeks") reads as performative satisfaction rather than a decision-weighted by flaws or visible tradeoffs. While the character is functional, the lack of internal contradiction and the too-smooth emotional progression prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to become the historian of small gestures") but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout. The "benevolently ruthless" attribute is declared but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Her walking ritual unfolds without internal contradiction or embodied emotion—no hesitation, no visceral stakes, only smooth execution. The nomadic penumbra exists as backdrop; no individual applies pressure that forces Elara to prioritize competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation (understanding home) is clear and her arc from avoidance to confrontation traces cleanly. The surrender to memory via the feather shows embodied emotion ("tears flowing as she channeled the raw truth"). However, the final realization feels somewhat abstract—"the shape of home was not a location...but the enduring architecture of connection she held inside"—leaning toward epiphany-speak rather than earned through micro-choices under contradictory impulses. The mercury-glass attribute is abandoned rather than tested in tension with her need.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's guilt-driven motivation is consistent and his chess-analogy perception feels character-specific. The exile penance and prince's Scholar's Mate failure ground his interior world. However, the final "deep, quiet peace" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or struggle in the decoding sequence itself—he fidgets, winnows threads, and succeeds cleanly. The tearless crying ("could not fall in this frozen realm") and channeled ache feel more asserted than embodied through micro-choices that cost him something in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear—refract truth into complexity—but her agency reads thin: she recites prepared poetry while the community passively absorbs it without meaningful resistance until Borin's token objection. The "innocently mischievous" trait appears only as a repeated label without constraining choice or generating visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through the scene with authorial confidence, and the elder's capitulation arrives without her having to forfeit anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to create meaning through kintsugi repair is clear and sustained, embodied through the physical ritual. The memory-quilting feels more described than enacted—interiority often tells us Lyra's moments rather than showing how these memories constrain or complicate his present repair choices. The final peace feels announced ("Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by profound peace") rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices exist but the arc trends toward therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (keeping a hidden promise to Lena) is clear and drives the journey, but his interior life relies heavily on lyric meditation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grief and nostalgia are embodied through sensory detail (salt air, pigment-stained fingers), yet the final choice—placing the shell and releasing grief—feels declared more than earned by dramatized struggle. The piece lacks a second on-page character to test relationship dynamics, so evaluation centers on solo interiority, which remains consistent but smooth. Emotional progression is realistic but lacks the messy irrationality that would lift it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motive—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is clear and drives the central act of opening the vial. His grief-rooted interiority and the deliberate choice to beckon rather than shout show character-specific reasoning. However, the transformation arrives too smoothly; Silas's instant conversion lacks the friction of competing impulses, and Elias's internal conflict never threatens his course. The final stance crystallization feels declarative rather than earned through contradictory pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's grief is embodied through tactile actions (soldering, touching the censer foot), but her interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak: "geography of loss," "raw solace," "reverse migration" repeated without concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to complete the circuit feels unmotivated—no struggle, no competing impulse dramatized. The "patchwork navigator" concept remains decorative; her salvaged-parts body never constrains a choice or creates friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives her journey, but her interiority leans heavily on therapeutic language ("psychological safety," "hyper-vigilance") that feels diagnostic rather than embodied. The involuntary truthfulness trait appears only in retrospective summary at the checkpoint, never constraining an on-page choice. Her embodied experience during the truffle hunt is concrete, but the closure moment—envisioning the future ritual rather than performing it—means the final choice lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interiority is consistently rendered through his "observing gaps" methodology and the weight of "witnessed isolation," but his interior arc operates almost entirely in reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to press the flower into the log and add a witness note feels earned by the accumulated particulars, yet the protagonist never faces a live decision that tests competing wants—he moves smoothly from curiosity to empathetic documentation without friction. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("tears welled, not of sorrow, but kinship"), but much of the emotional progression is told through abstract claims ("he felt a softly persistent need") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to honor Aris is clear and consistent, and his "empirically intuitive" trait shapes his choice to follow the ants. However, interiority leans toward stock epiphany phrasing: "The decision itself was the threshold—the choice to believe, to seek, to honor a vow against all odds" reads as summarized wisdom rather than embodied realization. The transformation from loneliness to "resonant connection" is declared more than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Emotional progression at closure feels tidy rather than layered with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    Queen Lyra's interior life is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The motivation is declared early ("unravel the mystery") but remains abstract; the climb itself offers few micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The "disenchantment washed away" shift at closure is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. The silver fox encounter and firefly moment provide fleeting specificity, but her agency remains passive observation more than decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains almost entirely external; her "scientifically romantic soul" and "purpose" are label-only assertions without embodied contradiction or trade-off. The piece observes Kael and Lyra's moment but never dramatizes Elara wrestling with competing impulses or paying a visible cost for her intervention. Interior monologue consists of thesis statements ("Her motivation burned clear") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The claimed "weaving her own memories of loss and loyalty" is told, not shown through micro-choices that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is specific and embodied—"hot, corrosive jealousy," "feral nostalgia" as "raw, animalistic hunger"—though the final epiphany ("The grave is not the story…They are the wind beneath your wings") veers toward therapy-speak without full dramatized cost in the prior beats. The internal contradiction between jealousy of past selves and acceptance is present but compressed; the shift from corrosive envy to "jaded wonder" feels declared more than earned through micro-choices. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the final turn relies on a scroll message rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile work, with her loss shaping a perceptual signature (touch replacing scent). Mrs. Gable's fear is shown through physical tells—tight shoulders, trembling knuckles—and the clamp repair becomes a vehicle for connection. However, the interiority leans heavily on therapeutic articulation ("emotional terrain," "landscape of vulnerability") that edges toward diagnostic label-speak rather than lived contradiction. The final "wholeness" and "trembling calm" feel slightly summarized rather than earned through a visible internal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the silver scars, and the choice to shed a tear represents a micro-choice under pressure. However, the transformation feels too tidy—the scars glow and rewrite themselves as narrative with minimal genuine struggle or internal contradiction during the peak beat. The grandmother's voice provides emotional texture, but Elara's scholarly dismissal of superstition doesn't create enough friction when she reverses course. The final stance is declared rather than earned through ambivalent action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and dramatized through concrete action—using the perfume and playing the music—with the overdue apology forming the spine. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("stone of guilt," "ethereal grit") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The spirit Valerius remains more atmospheric than psychologically complex, serving primarily as a vessel for Elara's closure rather than exerting independent pressure. The final gesture of acceptance feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through visible internal wrestling.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice ("I am") is earned by the spiral journey, but interiority remains abstract—"weight of solitude," "love for what was lost"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The closing smile is the first expression "in centuries," a claim that sits unanchored in her lived texture. Internal conflict is told ("confronted the abyss") rather than shown through simultaneous impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shepherd's motivation to understand what clocks measure is consistently dramatized through the counting ritual and embodied in his patient, observant demeanor. The mentor memory at "four" provides concrete grounding for his obsession. However, the epiphany at "two" arrives too cleanly—"Clocks do not measure time; they measure change"—crossing into label-speak without sufficient embodied cost. The final peace feels earned by the ritual's completion but the central realization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior voice has moments of specificity ("clover melancholy"), but the emotional journey is heavily narrated rather than embodied. Key moments—grief, understanding, love—are labeled ("A quiet sob escaped—not grief, but profound understanding") instead of dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final train discovery feels too convenient and the emotional arc too smooth; no genuine struggle or mistake complicates her tribute-quest, leaving her more avatar than character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is vivid and her renunciation of conventional music is motivated by loss, but her therapeutic stance—"teach endings how to begin"—leans toward diagnostic self-awareness that feels workshopped rather than discovered under pressure. The caller's grief is embodied through his compulsive dialing, yet his transformation from loop to path arrives too smoothly without contradictory impulses resisting the shift. Elara's micro-choices (humming the scale, tracing the disc) are present but her own stake remains observational; she guides rather than risks, so no cost forecloses a path for her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent and her micro-choices (lighting the lamp, steeping lavender, writing the covenant) are concrete and purposeful. However, interior contradiction is largely absent; she moves through the ritual without meaningful resistance or competing impulses. The peak moment—writing the new words—feels more like therapeutic self-care than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible struggle. Embodied emotion is present but the final shift from "lead to light" reads closer to assertion than earned transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—to cure loneliness—drives her presence at the station, and the final decision to give away the stone carries visible cost (she relinquishes the anchor and transforms her mission). However, the epiphany ("the stone held no magic. The cure was the act of connection itself") arrives abruptly without prior contradiction or internal struggle; the shift from jocularity to warmth lacks on-page friction. The secondary character (the young woman) applies pressure but remains a cipher, serving more as catalyst than participant. Minor orientation issue: "elusive disaster-relief logistician" is abstract job-title rather than lived detail, and the desperately jocular armor dissolves without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and consistent—skin-absorption, the ring's warmth, grief as a navigational problem—but emotional progression remains too smooth and diagnostic. "Grief and love are intertwined notes of one chord" reads as therapeutic insight rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from sharp edges to enduring strength lacks visible struggle or renunciation cost; acceptance arrives without on-page friction. Motivation is clear and drives the journey, but internal conflict never complicates the path in a way that forces a costly micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (threshing meaning) is clear and her arc from self-blame to systemic understanding tracks causally through the unbending ritual. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical language ("contingent relationships," "threshed meaning," "web of cause and effect") that reads more like prompt echo than embodied thought under pressure. The peak moment—"the error was not a solitary sin but a convergence within a vast web"—tells the insight rather than dramatizing it through concrete perception or micro-choice. Embodied emotion appears in the tear and fog-clearing visor, but the bulk of the transformation occurs in reflective summary rather than immediate sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his signing ritual, and the encounter with Lily provides meaningful contact. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("joyful sorrow," "sacred method") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to return feels inevitable but lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no renunciation dramatized. Emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution without the messier texture of genuine internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's transformation from arsonist to preservationist is clearly motivated by his sister's deathbed promise, and his interiority is grounded in embodied sensory detail ("hands...lifted the fragment with volcanic tenderness"). However, his analytical-intuitive trait functions mainly as a label; we're told he applies it rather than seeing contradictory impulses clash in scene. The change from destroyer to restorer is declared more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, and his past ideology is explained rather than tested by a live temptation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded in shared trauma, but his interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("quiet rebellion of a spirit refusing to be cataloged") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The drumming sequence shows embodied action, yet the internal experience remains mostly declarative—"poured his longing," "quiet fire"—without the messy collision of want versus fear under pressure. The final resolve ("settled resolve in his bones") reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible relational or tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's unique attribute (recognizing walks) is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates genuine internal conflict. His motivation is declared ("whispers travel farther than shouts") but never tested against a competing desire or cost. Vale's arc from skeptic to believer unfolds too smoothly without dramatized resistance. The zodiac coin and key are handled physically but function as props rather than pressure points that force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his consistent calm is embodied through deliberate actions (mirror, shutters). However, his interior remains opaque—we see agency only in service of Elara's arc, not contradictory impulses or personal cost. Elara's emotional shift from frozen to release is visible but lacks embodied complexity; her tears "washed clean tracks through despair" reads as label-only emotion. The half-spoken secret dissolves without dramatized renunciation or a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are clear and his attribute (hearing unspoken words) is used consistently across the narrative. The emotional progression through the students is embodied through their unspoken fears and hopes. However, the protagonist remains somewhat static—his "quiet rebellion" unfolds without internal contradiction or meaningful cost to him personally. The students' arc (especially Leo's) carries more weight than Elias's own transformation, which flattens his agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is heavily filtered through label-speak ("armor of shame," "guilt of survival") and therapeutic abstractions rather than embodied contradiction. The final emotional arc—"whole, unburdened, eyes clear with self-acceptance"—reads as declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Motivations remain consistent but the change lacks the visceral cost or lived struggle that would elevate it; the transformation feels granted by the scrimshaw's magic rather than forged through her agency. The reflection dominates the mid-section without enough present-tense friction to anchor the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied through whittling and performance as armor. The moral ambiguity around using the bouquet as prop and masking grief from Elara creates genuine internal conflict. The progression from rigid blankness to allowing one tear feels earned. Minor deduction: the phrase "morally ambiguous question" and "morally ambiguous regret" edges toward label-speak rather than letting the contradiction live purely in dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains a label rather than a person; "aesthetically driven in every breath and choice" tells rather than shows through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Interior experience consists almost entirely of abstract certainty and fulfillment without embodied friction or genuine cost. The "tremor of certainty" and "profound peace" are declared states rather than dramatized through competing desires that force visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find beauty in imperfection is clear and consistent, driving her plant arrangement and response to Kael's "failed" glass. Kael's arc from shame to acceptance is visible, though the transformation feels slightly rushed given the single conversation. Both characters' awakening moments land with embodied realization ("gasped," "wonder dawning"), but the interiority occasionally leans toward label-speak ("innocently cunning" as narrator assertion rather than demonstrated trait). The dual-POV structure with clean section breaks works, though Kael's internal contradiction could deepen—his shift from "grotesque, melted forms he saw as failures" to seeing beauty happens largely through Elara's reframing rather than his own struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior contradictions remain abstract—"powerfully gentle grace" and "quiet, persistent need" are labels rather than embodied tensions that force micro-choices under pressure. Dr. Aris is a stock skeptic who exists to be converted rather than to apply genuine counterpressure. The final tears feel unearned because the grandmother's music box arrives without prior dramatized longing or cost; the piece tells us she is bridging silence but does not show her risking or forfeiting a live option to do so.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her grief embodied in concrete actions (boxing tools, folding cranes), but the arc from paralysis to renewal feels telescoped. The discovery of the bioluminescent grove delivers a turn, yet her immediate emotional shift lacks the contradictory impulses that would sell the struggle—she moves from tears to design sketches without friction. Internal conflict is summarized rather than enacted in competing micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her cartomancer work is textured, but her interiority remains largely descriptive. Leo's arrival provides pressure, yet his transformation from "sharp confidence...eroded" to "posture straighter" feels summarized rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting on the page. The therapeutic reading of grief as "not isolation, but a thread" arrives as label rather than embodied discovery. No clear cost forecloses a path for either character.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior work with the atoms generates micro-choices under pressure, but the interior voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("anguished joy," "sentimental blindness") that reads more like thematic labeling than embodied contradiction. The purification sequence shows her navigating emotional currents with deliberate strategy, yet the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle—she "saw her people's current path mirrored" and "her own innocence fractured" without dramatized hesitation or cost that would charge the moment. The closing shift to "guardian of balance" arrives cleanly but the renunciation of her former role lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to preserve the shape of hope") is clear and her shift from guardian-against-change to witness feels earned through the archive discovery. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract emotional labels—"luminous regret," "sacred motivation"—rather than embodied contradiction. The river stone serves as concrete anchor, but her transformation proceeds through exposition rather than micro-choices under live pressure. Internal conflict remains more told than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "reconstruct her foundation of trust" is stated clearly, but her internal work unfolds almost entirely through reflection and symbolic gestures rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The shedding of layers (shame, indiscriminate trust, fear) reads as sequential self-talk rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional progression is presented as tidy stages—"she shed," "she visualized," "she reaffirmed"—without the irrationality or ambiguity that would signal genuine struggle. The final state feels declared rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (reading scars) is established early but remains abstract; her internal shift from "prying wounds" to "listening" is told through summary and label-speak ("understanding bloomed," "crystalline clarity") rather than embodied contradiction. The telepathy grants information but Elara never makes a micro-choice under competing pressures—she receives wisdom passively. The fern's memory and the oak's journey do narrative work, but Elara's agency is observation, not decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking where unused love is stored—and her gift is particularized through spatial-imaginative perception. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("hills of joy, valleys of sorrow") and the epiphany arrives through immersive vision rather than contradictory impulses forcing a choice. The final understanding feels received rather than earned through on-page struggle, and no genuine internal conflict threatens her trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation (grief-blocked creativity) is clear, but her agency consists almost entirely of a single passive ritual—tracing meteors while receiving insights. The "trapped creativity" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final "release" arrives through memory floods and a whispered command ("Rest"), not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract label-phrases ("profound silence," "fragile flame") and therapy-adjacent diagnostic language ("fear of the pain intertwined with beauty") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dreamless freight guard is defined primarily by his vow and mission rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation is coherent but presented through summary and reflection rather than embodied choices under pressure. The archive's weight and the chess clock are handled, but no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost—he walks, kneels, hums, nurtures sparks in a sequence that feels more iterative than internally conflicted. The final certainty ("quiet certainty was his only reward") tells rather than dramatizes the renunciation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared but never tested by competing wants or internal friction. His "anxieties unravel like loosened threads" summarizes change rather than dramatizing it through embodied contradiction. The protagonist moves through the forest without visible struggle or cost—gear insertion triggers transformation without forfeiture. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("peace settled deep in his bones") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("collaborative dance," "wild frontier of your mind") rather than character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated abstractly ("to find where unused courage waited") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The guides serve as passive conduits for delivered wisdom rather than forcing genuine internal conflict. The final "recognition" arrives as assertion ("tears of recognition") without prior dramatized struggle between competing desires. Emotional progression reads as smooth epiphany rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's guilt-driven interior is concrete and sustained, and her nerve pain functions as embodied emotion throughout. The final choice to memorialize Kael through the bolt and open chamber shows earned progression. However, the interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("grief-sharpened gaze," "frostbitten hope") and the peak realization moment leans on abstraction rather than lived contradiction. The micro-choices are present but the internal conflict could show more simultaneous warring impulses rather than sequential states.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The "regally unpretentious grace" remains a label without visible cost or behavioral tradeoff on the page. Internal experience is summarized across centuries rather than embodied in a single pressured moment where contradictory wants collide. The closure dissolves him into light without a final choice that forecloses a living path.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the tapping practice, and her motivation—assembling ecological memory—drives consistent micro-choices at the console. The delayed-revelation turn (discovering her own failsafe) feels unmotivated: no prior cue suggests she would forget encoding a biometric key, and the shift from "drifting moored" passivity to renewed purpose arrives via convenient plot device rather than earned internal friction. The final transformation reads cleanly, but the causality gap at the pivotal beat prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and persistent—seeking meaning amid broken rebellion—but the interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("quiet ache," "awkwardly confident grace") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother memory at the ending's threshold does useful character work, anchoring the opera glasses with generational weight. However, the final turn from despair to resolve reads as an epiphany delivered by the stones rather than a choice earned through internal conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's insurgent past and plant-telepathy traits are established early, but her interior life trends toward summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The choice to unseal the amber herself is signaled as "scoffing softly" at tradition, yet no on-page cost or trade-off pressures the decision—she simply acts. Embodied emotion is present ("tears streamed down her weathered cheeks") but the interiority leans on abstraction ("vindication," "insurgent conviction") rather than specific sensory or gestural conflict. The final scene with Kaela adds relationship pressure, but Elara's response is declarative wisdom without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and sustained—pearl of stillness, somatic grounding—but her decision path is retrospective; we observe aftermath rather than witness fresh choice. The freeze-to-grounding sequence is dramatized, yet the emotional beats recycle therapeutic vocabulary ("somatic markers," "realism's unshakable bedrock") instead of embodied contradiction. The final smile and orchid-watering gesture feel performed rather than inevitable, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation—shame over emotionally shallow portraits—is clearly rooted and drives his descent. The physical action of untangling threads works as embodied choice under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on diagnostic abstraction: "luminescent ache," "crestfallen thread," "self-compassion" read as label-speak rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment "he found his own crestfallen thread—a tight knot of shame—and gently teased apart its strands: fear, love for his craft, stifled hope" feels like therapeutic checklist rather than lived contradiction, costing credibility in the pivotal cellar beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his "serene anger" is embodied through deliberate tracking gestures and patient observation. The final renunciation—choosing not to rebuild the drone—carries cost, though the shift from seeker to accepter happens largely through reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Internal conflict is mostly sequential (anger → awe → acceptance) rather than layered, and the epiphany about perception feels slightly abstract rather than earned through micro-choices under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core choice lands with clear motivation—preservation versus revelation—and her conflict is embodied through physical action (transmitting the letter). However, interiority leans toward overwritten abstraction: "bravely conflicted," "redemption—to provoke an unspoken conversation," and "conscience roared louder" read as imposed labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice feels determined by the prompt rather than earned through on-page struggle; Kael's arrival accelerates the clock but doesn't deepen the trade-off or force a harder renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's pacifist stance and daily knife ritual establish clear motivation, but internal contradiction never complicates a single on-page choice—she never wavers, doubts, or pays visible cost for her convictions within this scene. The "senselessly perceptive" trait remains label-only; detecting silver hue or hearing a petal unfurl doesn't constrain or enable a consequential action. Embodied emotion is present (cool glass, rough sandbag scrap) but the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's cool-headed resolve manifests clearly through "voiced silence" and deliberate movement, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("quiet intensity," "profound understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The grief for her lost daughter surfaces late and feels inserted to generate emotion rather than complicating earlier choices. Her competence is high throughout—no genuine struggle or mistake pressures her arc until the vortex, where the shift to openness rather than capture reads more told than earned through prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover truth is clear and she demonstrates observational capacity through archival cross-referencing. However, her emotional progression feels too smooth—grief shifts to "soft, wry chuckle" and "solemn playfulness" without the messy contradictory impulses that should accompany discovering a grandfather's staged suicide. The final paragraph's "crushing orbits of regret had been gently redirected" arrives as summary rather than earned internal struggle. Micro-choices exist (examining the nib, opening the journal) but lack visceral cost or hesitation that would ground the stakes in embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (to hush guilt) is stated clearly, but her interior experience relies heavily on label-speak and abstract emotional landscapes rather than embodied contradiction. The niece backstory arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, weakening the earned quality of the final reconciliation. The translation attribute reads more like a stated skill than a lived competence under pressure; we never see her struggle with ambiguity or cost in deploying it. The final choice—humming the sonic translation—feels ordained rather than wrestled from conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly personal ("to discover meaning in the mess of her own recent unraveling"), and her socially perceptive gift is shown through concrete actions (sensing "the brittle crack of a surrendered grudge"). Internal experience differs from external behavior through embodied perception rather than diagnostic labels. However, the final shift to "quiet joy" and understanding feels slightly telescoped—the emotional progression from unease to resolution lacks sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat, and the epiphany ("not erasure, but alchemy") edges toward stated wisdom rather than fully earned bodily realization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is established through embodied actions (kneeling, brushing ash, inscribing) and the tessera anchor, but her motivation remains largely declared rather than tested by contradictory impulses. The "retrocognitively trapped" trait functions as a label until the midpoint when touching the tessera triggers memory, yet no scene demonstrates her actively choosing between competing goods under that constraint. The renaming act and shelter-building gesture toward change, but the resolution arrives through authorial assertion ("profound release") rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to lure the possibility of her unfinished duet") but her choices feel predetermined rather than tested under contradictory impulses. The synesthetic interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("silver thread," "amber strand," "liquid sapphire") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Julian's appearance as "vibrant essence" arrives as reward rather than through dramatized struggle, and the final dissolution reads as closure-by-label ("profound, peaceful acceptance") rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. No genuine flaws complicate her path; she executes her plan without friction, mistake, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's skepticism-compassion conflict is signaled but rarely forces micro-choices under pressure; she surrenders to somatic markers without visible internal resistance or cost. The final shift from "devoted skeptic" to someone who honors mystery feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Maya remains a static pressure source—grief-stricken throughout—without developmental arc or contradictory impulses that would create relational friction. Interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("somatic markers," "willowglass hope," "fractally precise") that abstracts experience rather than embodying it through character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and drives her choices through the network, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("purpose burned with quiet intensity") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The transition from encountering the fossil to the decision to map it feels inevitable rather than contested; no visible internal friction appears when she chooses to remove the artifact or later decides to leave it for others. The final turn toward continuing her work reads as affirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is signaled (spin prophecy into possibility) but her internal experience remains abstract—forty years of button-cataloging is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The pivot from cataloging to action at the end lacks on-page struggle; we see the decision announced ("resolve settling like dust") without witnessing competing desires or a visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("roots in stone," "stitches in time's fraying hem") rather than character-particular perception, flattening voice distinction and reducing embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "fix what was broken" is present but operates largely through interior summary and symbolic gesture rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The pillbox reveal and Anya's arrival create a moment of vulnerability, but the character arc feels narrated more than enacted—"He had not opened it for weeks" tells us fragility without showing the struggle to open it now. Anya's presence adds relational pressure, yet her reaction ("breath caught; fingers brushed") reads gestural rather than a friction point that alters Elias's stance with visible cost. The final thaw is asserted ("felt the first true thaw within") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's interior motivation is clear and consistently rooted in grief and love, with the yarn needle serving as a concrete anchor. The percolation metaphor structures his reflection coherently, and the shift from regret to acceptance feels earned by the fog-crossing meditation. However, the interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity") that distances emotional embodiment; the epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. No secondary character pressure tests choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the oasis's resistance to change—and his potter's "sharp gentleness" with clay translates coherently to handling the glass. His final choice to carry this ethos into the wasteland feels earned by the vision sequence. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("phototropic devotion," "temporal roots") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the vision arrives passively rather than through a difficult micro-choice that forecloses another path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and her motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" drives her ritual choice. However, the piece veers into diagnostic label-speak ("wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability") repeatedly, weakening embodied emotion. Mateo's brief appearance provides a witness moment but lacks interaction that would test Elara's stance. The final renunciation (storing the gauge for next season) carries cost but remains largely internal without significant on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to translate isolation into independence is stated but only partly dramatized through micro-choices (carrying the sundial, writing the chronicle). The reincarnation memory structure provides internal contradiction—Elara versus Kaelen—but the interiority leans toward exposition ("she now knew herself as Kaelen") rather than embodied conflict acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to document feels earned by the memory experience, though the cost (solitude accepted) is more declared than viscerally shown. Emotional progression is legible but tilts abstract in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (finding "the thread that connects all things") is clearly signaled and drives her decision to create the installation, with the final placement of "home" earning the closure choice. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic phrasing ("persistent hum beneath her solitude," "luminous web") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The emotional progression from isolation to kinship is told through elevated summary rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses in scene. The keeper-of-secrets occupation remains decorative; we never see her struggle with a client's secret or make a trade-off that tests her role.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and consistent—outwit cosmic tricksters—but his interior remains thin and label-driven rather than contradictory under pressure. The "cautiously hopeful resolve" is asserted twice without embodied tension; his weary tears at the end feel performative rather than earned by prior micro-choices. Dean Croft's memo and the quad conflict are told rather than dramatized, flattening the relational crucible. No meaningful internal contradiction acts on the page; he proceeds from plan to execution without genuine friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and prudent nature are embodied through physical reactions (cold sweat, panic clawing at her throat) and micro-choices under pressure. The motivation—saving her village from endless winter—is clear and drives the climactic choice to climb into the organ loft despite her terror. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract poeticism ("wistful rebellion stirred within") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation feels more declared than earned through prior causality; the shift from terror to awe happens abruptly without intermediate micro-choices that would make the change legible.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's face blindness motivates her method (reading souls not faces), but the trait functions mostly as backstory explanation rather than constraining present choices at the quarry. Her discovery sequence shows methodical observation, yet the internal contradiction between seeking to "awaken empathy in others" and her own "guarded solitude" is told rather than enacted through competing impulses in scene. The final tears and ignited empathy arrive as assertion—"Clara's courage had ignited it within her first"—without prior dramatized resistance or cost that would make the shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's idealism and research motivation are established early, and the copper nail connects her to Aris through embodied handling. However, her "nervously confident" attribute remains mostly label-only without visible tradeoffs during high-pressure moments. The technician's instant belief after years of skepticism feels unmotivated, and Elara's emotional arc from isolation to purpose reads clean but predictable without contradictory impulses complicating her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("pixelated amnesty," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. His transformation from grief to renewal proceeds too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost-forecloses—he simply "understands" and plays. The final action (placing glass on strings, playing) feels declared rather than dramatically earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is asserted through thesis-like phrasing instead of dramatized through conflicted embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo's perceptively calm trait is labeled repeatedly but only rarely embodied in action under pressure. The confrontation with Kai reads as tutorial-mode, with Leo guiding rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses. Internal conflict is present in the backstory (startup collapse, father's legacy) but arrives as summary; the on-page choices lack sufficient contradiction or visceral cost. The final renunciation of the currency collection offers a gesture toward change, but the decision feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible struggle in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to decode temple inscriptions is clear and drives her to fatigue, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The telegram-triggered emotional pivot ("tears welled; Kael's words...began to heal the isolation") leans toward label-only emotion; the shift from isolation to connection is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final act of writing the chronicle shows agency, yet the choice feels inevitable rather than conflicted, missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior life reads as extended metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The "unbending" as both literal physical action and metaphorical stance works on paper, yet the moment of surrender ("breath trembling with surrender") arrives via declaration rather than dramatized resistance. The frozen confession reveal—her own younger self turning from a friend's plea—offers specificity, but twenty years of rigidity resolves in a single kneeling gesture without visible struggle or cost that alters present tactics. Interiority leans heavily on elevated abstractions ("warlike serenity," "armor forged in betrayal") that remain consistent in register but lack the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's root-bound motivation is established early, and the scar-linking method provides embodied interiority. However, motivation reads as declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses; the sequence of linking scars → clipping glows → path appears → rift heals proceeds without genuine internal conflict or cost that forecloses a competing want. The "anxious elation" label recurs but lacks embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. Therapeutic phrasing ("profound peace," "deep, abiding peace") at closure softens what should be a harder-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his actions align with remorse, but his interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("fiercely gentle precision," "reckless hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation at closure—absorbing Elara's sorrow—is dramatized with visible cost ("cold sorrow flooded the hole in his chest"), yet the interior voice often summarizes emotional states rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final acceptance of the patched hole with "threads of silver" earns the endurance, but prior beats rely on poetic assertion more than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's motivation is clear—seeking purpose after public failure—but the internal work feels heavily summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "confidently uncertain" trait is asserted repeatedly ("objectively worthless—but utterly certain of its emotional weight") without constraining an on-page decision with visible cost. Interiority relies on therapy-speak labels ("insulating emotionally with facts," "echo valley longing") that name states rather than embody contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to "chronicler of the unsung" arrives as declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris exhibits consistent interior contradiction—grief versus scholarly ambition—and his choices (adjusting instruments, documenting, finally planting the seed) align with "kindly methodical" trait. The final renunciation of "haunted ambition" and shift to "gardener of hope" shows earned change with visible cost: thirty years of chasing retrieval abandoned for acceptance. However, the epiphany ("the physics of transition was not about tracking the gone, but honoring the connection that remained") arrives via sudden realization rather than through embodied struggle in the planting scene itself, slightly undermining the climb. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, tears) but some lines veer toward therapy-speak ("sharp edges of grief rounding into purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is handled through poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"balanced clarity" and "steadfast flame" label states without showing impulses in collision. The core action of smelting fragments demonstrates commitment to her role, but the choice lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; she performs ritual without dramatized struggle. The moon-phase attribute is mentioned but never constrains an on-page decision. Motivation remains asserted rather than tested under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly rooted in grief over his daughter and professional isolation, and the pearl-carrying ritual establishes character-particular behavior. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("vault door within his chest," "fortress of isolation") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic placement choice reads as pre-determined by thematic design rather than a dramatized internal struggle with competing impulses acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to seek self-forgiveness is clearly established and drives the pilgrimage structure. Interiority is concrete in many beats ("knuckles white," "razor-sharp" perception), but therapy-speak intrudes at pivotal moments: "self-forgiveness was not a destination to be charted, but a practice" reads diagnostic rather than lived. The accordion's patched bellows serve as embodied symbol of regret and the final choice to carry it forward with acceptance shows earned endurance. However, the epiphany arrives through bathroom graffiti wisdom rather than a dramatized struggle, softening the cost of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find the library is declared but her interior remains abstract—"whispered legends and aching voids" reads generic. The apology she carries for twenty years appears only in summary late in the piece, denying the reader access to contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to speak aloud feels asserted rather than earned by prior dramatized struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Embodied emotion is scarce; tears and trembling hands are stock gestures that do not particularize her state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her plant telepathy provides embodied interiority ("wave of verdant sorrow"), but the internal conflict feels asserted rather than enacted through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The Director's decree is told rather than felt as live pressure complicating her choice. The climactic decision to play the violin is adequately motivated by prior setup, though the renunciation of the Archive's demand lacks visible hesitation or cost-layering in the moment of choice. Micro-choices exist but emotional progression reads more as smooth certainty than credible ambivalence under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's vow and her precise ritual create clear motivation, and her hands-on work with the emerald chip gives embodied purpose. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated descriptors ("lucidly watchful awareness," "clear pool reflecting") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The tear at closure reads sentimental rather than earned through visible internal conflict, and Kael remains a passive object rather than a second character applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find contentment is present but her interior experience is heavily mediated by poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The "kindly decisive" trait appears label-only until the tree-climbing ritual, where micro-choices finally emerge. The carving ritual provides one meaningful on-page act, but sixty years of stewardship and the weight of forgiveness are told rather than dramatized through pressure that tests her stance. No secondary character appears to create relational friction or complicate her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation and method are clearly established, but her character remains largely functional—a vehicle for the therapeutic process rather than a figure with contradictory impulses. Kael's interiority is more developed, with embodied emotion in the tear and trembling hands, though the arc from rigid guilt to release follows a predictable therapeutic template. The "sincerely insincere reassurance" attribute is named but not dramatized as a visible trade-off or constraint that costs Elara something. Diagnostic language ("calcified his spirit," "protected vulnerability") edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation (teaching vanishing to appear through loss patterns) is clearly established and embodied through the trance ritual. However, interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("temporal layer," "delayed revelation," "transformation not erasure") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The withheld memory of Elara provides emotional grounding, but the choice to withhold feels declared rather than tested under pressure—he enters the trance already resolved. No meaningful internal conflict forces a micro-choice that alters present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Corbin's motivation (navigate without moving) is clear and distinct, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("spirit yearned to map the canyon's true geography—not of stone, but of resonance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—humming the foundational tone and becoming a bridge—feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-decisions under pressure. Emotional progression is largely contemplative without visceral conflict; thepiece tells us his resolve is "weathered" and "scarred by decades of failed dawns" but shows no on-page struggle or mistake that would dramatize those limits.

    Elara's motivation—witnessing magic untouched by calculation—is clear and consistent, driving her to ascend rather than refuse the task. Her micro-choices (mist walking, unstrapping shame, leaving the keystone) align with her values and embody her internal conflict with the guild's automation ethos. The interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("quiet ache," "sacred in the simple") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which flattens the dramatization of internal conflict. The final renunciation (leaving the keystone) is earned by prior setup, but the embodied stakes feel muted—tears freeze, she bows, yet the cost reads conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (discovering the color of sound tied to grief for Elara) is clear and his defining attribute (hiding behind truth) is stated early, but the actual *dramatization* of internal contradiction remains thin. The moment when his defensive truth-telling "crumbles" in the climax is told rather than shown through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final tears and "heart open" register as label-only emotional summary without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. Backstory about Elara anchors motive but the present renunciation lacks the visible cost and trade-off required to elevate characterization above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is highly abstract and repetitive—"wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "quiet enthusiasm" are label-recycled across dozens of lines without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The coin-casting ritual and vigil stance are present, but her decision to cast lots feels ceremonial rather than conflicted; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. Emotional progression flattens into solemn acceptance without dramatized struggle. The final "alignment" reads as affirmation of a path already walked, not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to name fears is clearly established and his grief is consistently embodied through "tears of pure energy" and the "hollow of his being." However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated poetic abstractions ("vibration," "echoes charged with raw emotion") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation from "crushing weight to purposeful ache" is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation feels signaled but not earned through visible internal conflict that forecloses other paths with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's devotion is established early and her earnest naivety drives the restoration attempt, but her internal experience remains largely static—she watches, trusts, and succeeds without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "lukewarm talent" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction; her soup-warming magic is irrelevant to the plot. Embodied emotion appears in the final tears, but much of the interiority reads as summary ("her devotion a fragile flame shielded from doubt") rather than specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. The final success feels assured rather than earned through struggle with genuine blindspots or costs that foreclose alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is coherent and her "precisely humane" attribute does enable the key choice to rescue versus expunge the bottle. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract description ("compassionate was not sentimentality but intentional, respectful action") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grief memory at the bottle's discovery shows embodied emotion, but the resolution feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she simply wraps the artifact and moves forward without visible internal cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between logic and intuition is established early, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract label-speak ("harmonize logic's sharp edges with intuition's quiet hum") rather than embodied, scene-specific thought. The mentor's river stone is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. The climactic decision to weave copper wire feels unmotivated by prior struggle—she simply observes starlings and knows the answer, bypassing genuine on-page doubt or cost. The "secretly sentimental" attribute remains ornamental rather than driving action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve trust is embodied through the parachute buckle memory and the revision act, with clear internal contradiction between past failure and present duty. The muscle-memory anchor provides concrete embodiment. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("soundless echo of resolution," "shared weight lifted") rather than maintaining character-particular texture under pressure. The final choice to revise is earned, but the emotional progression feels overly calibrated rather than messy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaela's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("void," "silence after the storm," "numbness") rather than embodied contradictions. The union with the duplicate happens through statement and metaphor without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. The ending warmth ("grief for her journey, joy for this creation") reads as emotional arithmetic—tidy resolution rather than layered irrationality. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously on the page; the protagonist moves smoothly from numbness to wholeness without visible struggle or tradeoff cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through ritual action, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("mournfully eager," "sacred duty") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment where he hears Clara's laughter offers emotional payoff, but the choice to continue tomorrow feels like resolved commitment rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice is consistent but leans toward elevated metaphor throughout, reducing character-particular texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied detail—ink-stained claws, pendant clutched against sternum—and the motivational arc from desperate hope to conscious purpose reads as earned. The climactic choice to release the pendant carries visible cost and contradictory impulses (the sob, the magnetic desperation versus the stillness). However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis ("make friends with uncertainty," "befriend the unknown path") that no one formulates mid-crisis, and the final paragraphs summarize the emotional resolution rather than dramatizing it through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation (interrupt stifling destiny) is clear and drives the transformation sequence. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction—"stoically sensitive nature," "hope, defiance, love"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final surrender and creative-destruction epiphany arrive without sufficient prior micro-choices revealing her hierarchy of values; the turn feels declared more than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Emotional progression is linear rather than layered with the hypocrisy or self-deception that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's thirty-year quest and her motivation are clearly articulated, but her interiority is largely expository and meditative rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The act of discarding assumptions unfolds as a sequence of releases, yet these feel narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The final transformation from seeker to listener is declared more than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion and internal conflict are present but lack the specificity and friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo's "resiliently positive spirit" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—he remains serenely competent throughout the anomaly without embodied fear, doubt, or cost. The interior is often abstract ("his motivation crystallized with starlit clarity") rather than character-particular. The hourglass gesture and humming feel like external choreography without visceral stakes or a hierarchy of values under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he simply succeeds and smiles "deeper and wiser" without forfeiting a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interior remains at a consistent register of abstract philosophizing without embodied contradiction. The key turn—"she had sought to dissect connection, but now she was immersed"—is told rather than enacted through micro-choices. Emotional progression during the eruption relies on label-speak ("painful understanding," "vulnerable, breathing truth") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation of control is asserted but lacks visible cost in foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and sustained, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment "trace the geometry in our bones" exemplifies label-only profundity without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Lyra's arc from skepticism to "poised understanding" reads as a tidy emotional stage rather than layered struggle; her final line "I feel oriented" lacks the cost or ambiguity that would elevate the shift. The instructor role remains competent throughout without blind spots that drive compounding mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly framed (protect vulnerable voices), but her interior life is thinly embodied—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The hearing-aid tracing unfolds without struggle or misstep; she never faces a meaningful trade-off or blind spot that compounds before resolution. Lily's grief is asserted ("rendered her nearly invisible") rather than dramatized through contradictory behavior. The final "quiet triumph" and straightened shoulders read as summary rather than earned emotional complexity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris's motivations are clear and consistent—standing by the unremembered drives every choice from descent to placement of the codex. Internal conflict between claustrophobia and purpose is embodied through physical sensation ("serpent of claustrophobia tightening") and micro-choices (focusing on the gold's pulse as anchor). The transformation from fear to sanctuary feels earned through the witnessed message, with visible cost in the codex left behind. Minor slip: the emotional arc from terror to peace could sustain more friction in the final beats before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("ghost of her own erased life," "midnight vigil") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The heartbeat-counting trait is told more than dramatized; it never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. The ink ritual feels procedural rather than motivated by genuine internal conflict, and the "wisdom crystallized" moment arrives as assertion rather than earned through on-page struggle. No micro-choices reveal competing values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—translating the diamond's texture into sound to preserve the Old Tongue—but her internal life remains largely functional rather than contradictory. The copper-veined detail and her role as "last quietly articulate speaker" are evocative, yet her embodied emotion under pressure stays muted; the warming diamond and lifted weight of centuries read more as plot markers than lived struggle. The piece withholds genuine flaws or competing impulses that would complicate her choices. Her success feels inevitable rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's skepticism-to-wonder arc is structurally clear but relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("bitterness," "wonder") rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift feels declared more than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Lyra and Elara remain functional but underdeveloped; their interiority is thin, and the metamorphosis sequence bypasses genuine struggle. The piece gestures toward internal conflict but doesn't dramatize contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her physical actions (descending, uprooting vines) drive key turns. However, her interior life leans heavily on abstraction—"quiet, persistent flame," "thread of understanding"—rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to uproot the monolith feels less like a struggle between competing desires and more like a predetermined fulfillment of her role. Embodied emotion appears in tears at the end, but peak moments favor poetic summary over visceral particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation (healing broken promises via his sister's death) is clear and drives his smuggling choice. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("brittle hush," "thunderstorm in a bottle," "respectfully rebellious") that feels more like poetic labeling than embodied contradiction. The final choice—launching the drone—feels unmotivated by immediate on-page pressure; no patrol threatens discovery at that exact moment, so the risk reads more symbolic than situationally urgent. Emotional states (reverence, sorrow, purpose) are asserted through metaphor rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from silence to song is motivated by accumulated grief and the carousel discovery, but the progression feels compressed—twelve years of muteness broken in a single beat without sufficient embodied struggle. The "quietly persistent grace" and carpenter's identity are told more than shown constraining choices. Internal contradiction is present (love/loss, silence/possibility) but the obsidian eyes "softening" and wood feeling "alive" drift toward convenient magic rather than earned psychological shift. The final peace "settling over her like a warm shroud" lands cleanly but the path there smooths over the cost of voice recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interior life is specific (the scarf as anchor, the geometry obsession), but her journey is largely contemplative without meaningful internal contradiction. The climactic memory sequence at lines 128–176 offers embodied emotion and a concrete micro-choice (aligning the scarf), yet the final "carry the library of folds within her" reads as label-only insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother functions well as a remembered pressure point, but Elara's present-tense agency remains thin—observation and realization dominate over difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, grounded in the decade-long ache for the runaway dream. Her interiority remains concrete through embodied gestures—mineral-stained fingers, climbing stairs, cradling the palette—but the progression from longing to "recognition" and "quiet understanding" feels somewhat tell-heavy rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to "keeper of inner light" reads as label rather than dramatized cost, and no genuine mistake or blind spot complicates her choices. The change occurs but lacks visible friction that would elevate it beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith remains an abstraction throughout—his motivation is told ("improbable longing") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority consists of elevated label-speak ("enveloped secrets," "fear's rigid architecture") rather than character-particular perception. The final "peace she had not known" beat for Elara is asserted without prior on-page setup, and the locksmith's renunciation or gain is never made concrete. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; he executes a ritual without visible cost or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris is motivated clearly by memory recovery and exhibits embodied tension ("cold seeping through his trousers," tears tracing paths through grime). His chronic curiosity functions as both trait and method, driving him to the site and sustaining focus during the detection ritual. The interiority occasionally edges toward summary ("profound release and understanding") rather than contradiction in action, and Elara's climactic choice is presented as recovered memory rather than dramatized present conflict, which softens the on-page agency cost. The final arc—avoidance broken, truth carried as compass—reads earned but tilts slightly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's internal contradiction between retreat impulse (walking backwards) and mentorship commitment is embodied on the page through concrete choices: he halts the backward steps, takes a forward step at closure. Elara's progression from rigid rejection to tentative engagement reads as earned through the tea-leaf ritual's concrete particularity. However, the interiority leans toward explanation rather than contradictory impulse acting simultaneously—"A familiar anxiety tightened Kael's core" names the state rather than enacting fragmented perception under stress. The closure choice (annotating "Return") emerges from guided discovery but lacks visible cost; Elara's hand "steadies" without dramatizing what she forfeits by committing to this path.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The "weaving between worlds" sequence unfolds as uncontested visualization work with no embodied struggle or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("insatiably creative spirit," "profound connection") rather than concrete perception and bodily tension. The closure forecloses no visible path; planting the seed reads as fulfillment without renunciation or cost that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and her scarred fingers and years handling sorrow provide embodied history. Internal conflict emerges through "lucid unrest" settling into "quiet understanding," but the progression feels too smooth—no genuine struggle between competing impulses dramatized in scene. The final realization about restoration is articulated rather than discovered through contradictory micro-choices. The grandmother's journal and apprentice sacrifice backstory anchor present action, but Elara's agency reads more as ritual executor than someone wrestling with flawed impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's perceptual skills are well-established through concrete action (tracing ghost rivers, comparing footage frame-by-frame), and her "shielded openness" generates subtle internal tension. Her motivation—connection over conquest—shapes the discovery arc consistently. However, the final moment lacks visible cost or internal contradiction; she experiences kinship and approval rather than foreclosing a path or paying a price, which keeps this from reaching higher bands despite strong trait specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in grief over Elara's loss, driving his search for closure. His "quietly analytic" nature shapes perception ("observed viscosity, terminal velocity") but slides into diagnostic abstraction ("physics of letting go," "vectors of surrender") that reads more like theme statement than lived interior. The snow globe moment works well—embodied observation leading to micro-choice—but the final shift feels more declared than dramatically earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending renunciation is signaled but not tested by a meaningful counter-pressure that would force visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established—to articulate unspoken needs—but her internal contradiction is thin; she exists in a sustained poetic state without visceral pressure testing her commitment. The carving sequence shows craft but no moment where doubt, fatigue, or cost threatens her resolve. Embodied emotion is present ("chest swelling") but leans toward performed satisfaction rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and certainty read as unearned epiphany, lacking prior causality that would make her feeling "heard" a costly achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivations are clear and rooted in his sister's illness, which drives his curiosity toward the diary. The interiority is concrete and particular ("Lyra's hands planting seeds in their window box during her weakest days"), avoiding therapy-speak. However, the final transformation feels more declared than earned through contradictory impulses; Kael moves smoothly from grief to insight without genuine friction. The "affectionate detachment" is asserted in narration ("he held the captain's grief and gratitude without being consumed") rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris is established with clear motivation (memorialize Elara) and a consistent method (cloud categorization). Internal contradiction appears ("quietly explosive" claimed but not demonstrated through simultaneous opposing impulses in scene), and the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("anxiety," "melancholy," "acceptance") rather than embodied perception. The final sob and closure feel earned by prior causality, but the journey is more catalogue than genuine struggle with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's face blindness redirects her perception toward tactile detail, which motivates the coin discovery and final realization organically. The internal shift from frustration at walls-as-limits to acceptance of boundaries-as-vessels is earned through the fractal discovery. Minor weakness: the epiphany arrives quickly without sufficient on-page struggle or contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in scene. The renunciation of the murals and forward walk carry visible cost but feel slightly declarative rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly and her diligent curiosity drives the sequence of observations. However, interiority remains thin—her discovery unfolds through puzzle-solving rather than internal contradiction or struggle. The final tears and "keeper of light" label feel asserted rather than earned through embodied emotion under pressure. No meaningful choice forecloses a path; she solves the puzzle and succeeds without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (learning "the rhythm of repair") is stated but abstract; her mentor and nostalgia are told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The pivotal choice—selecting and installing the replacement gear—feels technical rather than internally conflicted; no visible trade-off or foreclosed path emerges on the page. Interiority leans on poetic labels ("driftwood nostalgia," "warm, enduring ember") rather than embodied contradiction. The final tears gesture at fulfillment but lack prior struggle that would earn the release.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ensemble cast (seven named members) spreads thin across the word budget, reducing individual interiority. Kael's engineering skepticism and Lena's intuitive touch provide glimpses of contradiction, but most characters function as coordinated parts rather than individuals with competing impulses. The family's unity is asserted more than tested; the blight threatens their orchard but no interpersonal friction emerges under pressure. Elara's altruism is labeled rather than embodied through conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is seeded early (lullaby/grandmother memory) and her final act is consistent with stated values, but interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("bruised awe," "love fulfilled") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The puppet head functions more as a static symbol than a live object that forces micro-choices; her decisions feel predetermined rather than wrested from competing impulses. No secondary character on the page limits relationship crucible opportunities. Backstory blocks are evocative but do not visibly alter present tactics or tilt a choice within the lighthouse scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's reluctant caretaker role is embodied through her "shoulders relax" only after the family escapes, and the closing line "Reluctance was her constant companion" is earned by repeated references to instinct begging her to flee. The attribute "offhandedly exact precision" appears twice but functions as description rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene—her movements are merely labeled graceless yet precise without dramatizing internal conflict during the assembly. Motivation is clear and intensifies organically, and the blood-oath backstory primes the present choice without flattening it, but the final renunciation (repeating tomorrow despite reluctance) lacks visible cost beyond emotional summary.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's chemist lens and symphonic perception are established early, and his final choice to draft the proposal with Elara's name is motivated by the foam-pattern insight. However, interiority relies heavily on extended metaphor ("monomers linking into resilient chains," "cross-linking agent") that reads more as thematic summary than embodied thought under pressure. The grief-to-purpose arc is told through reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices are present but feel more like steps in a pre-charted emotional journey than genuine struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is abstract and philosophical rather than rooted in embodied contradiction or immediate stakes. Her interiority consists mostly of conceptual meditation ("the place where stories begin") without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final gesture of incising the slate is presented as a culmination of her quest, but no prior on-page struggle or renunciation forecloses a live alternative path with felt cost. The customer's arrival feels like validation rather than a choice that alters Elara's state.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's gift is established clearly and his motive to "sandpaper rough memories" drives the action. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("emotions were emotionally contagious through touch," "mental sandpaper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final subsuming sequence operates more as a described process than a dramatized choice with competing impulses. Internal conflict reads as narrated method rather than simultaneous warring desires.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "empathetically decisive" nature reads as a label applied uniformly across beats without genuine internal friction or visible cost to her choices. The interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptor phrases ("gentle urgency," "quiet joy") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure. The final reflection on isolation feels like retroactive motivation-building rather than a choice-shaping force present throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from engineer to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is asserted via exposition ("This period of profound transformation…") without on-page choices that reveal internal conflict. Embodied emotion appears only as generic tears ("not of sorrow but of connection") and the helix-minded trait functions as a label rather than a constraint that shapes decisions under pressure. The transformation is complete before the story begins, leaving no stakes-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's prism-mind trait is introduced vividly but operates primarily as a label enabling passive observation rather than forcing contradictory choices under pressure. The dominant motivation (finding vault combinations) drives her through the grotto, but no meaningful internal conflict complicates the journey—she succeeds cleanly without trade-offs or visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin; "latent blaze," "quiet fire," and "tears traced clean paths" read as stock phrases rather than character-particular sensations. The final triumph is declared ("profound, silent triumph") rather than dramatized through a difficult renunciation or earned failure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and persistent—creating music in silence—but her interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("symphonically minded perception," "dissonant chord yearning for resolution") that reads more like authorial commentary than lived emotional experience. The final tears and "heart full" moment gesture toward embodied emotion but lack contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; she executes her method without meaningful friction or cost that forecloses a path. The hedgehog and siskin observe rather than apply pressure, leaving Elara's arc feeling more like a demonstration than a transformation with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is present but often abstract and label-heavy ("quiet, stubborn drive to discover beauty in the difficult"). The protagonist's journey from exile to acceptance is summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The worry stone provides embodied anchoring, but key emotional transitions—tears, the realization about the dent—arrive as declarations rather than emerging from micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of exile-identity reads more as reflection than earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's pacifist trait and "intuitively descriptive" nature remain largely ornamental labels rather than sources of on-page contradiction or costly choice. Her empathy work proceeds smoothly without genuine internal conflict—she weeps on cue but never hesitates, doubts her method, or pays a personal price that alters her stance. The neighbor Mr. Henderson exists only as backstory; no second character appears to test her convictions in real time. Motivation is declared ("catalog the varieties of silence") but not dramatized through conflicting desires or micro-choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and her journey shows internal contradiction between ambition and serenity. The cultivation ritual demonstrates embodied engagement through olfactory sensitivity and deliberate care. However, the epiphany arrives without sufficient prior struggle—her "trembling hope" and final "tears welled" feel asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal resistance. The grandmother's maxim provides wisdom but risks being too tidy a solution for the complex tension the story sets up.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation (save withered groves) is clear and his interior shifts from seeking to understanding. The arrow tip functions as both inherited object and guide, warming to signal proximity—embodied and specific. However, the epiphany at the Cradle Arch arrives without meaningful internal conflict; he simply "understands" resilience through reverence without a visible choice that forecloses another path. The shift from harvest-intention to protect-intention feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—the investigator framing and "cultivate foresight" drive are signaled early. Interior texture shows purposeful detail (anemometer readings, aviation background) and the patch becomes a recurring anchor for his professional covenant. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("singular convergence," "documented truth") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic discovery of Croft's patch crystallizes emotional weight, but Kael's internal conflict remains more summarized than enacted in contradictory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested through contradictory pressures. The synesthesia trait remains label-only; we're told she sees colors as music but never witness her struggle with competing sensory demands or make a micro-choice shaped by that constraint. The ending declares "body weary but spirit soaring" and "peace settling over her," flattening what should be complex emotional cost into therapy-speak summary. No on-page choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior regret and motivation are established clearly, but embodied emotion remains largely abstract—"weight of regret," "frantic echoes of self-recrimination"—rather than physically grounded. The insight at closure ("deafness to the world's quiet language") lands as an epiphany but feels stated rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is present but alternates between reflection and ritual action rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") is asserted early but her "transposed empathy" reads as a described attribute rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift—recognizing "the mathematics was the dance itself"—arrives as epiphany-by-declaration rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path. The philosopher's grief and poet's joy collide mid-piece, yet the resolution to "harmonize" them within her feels clean and unearned, lacking visible cost at the closure moment. Embodiment is intermittent: "hollow chest," "quickened pulse" are vivid, but much of the interiority leans on abstract labels ("visceral resonance," "transposed empathy") rather than action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is seeded early and his journey from "jittery" to "steady" reads coherently, but the transformation relies heavily on a mystical mechanism rather than internal contradiction acting in scene. The pendant-triggered memory deepens without genuine friction between competing impulses; Elara's lesson arrives as summary insight ("Life persists…") rather than embodied discovery. The final calm feels granted by the artifact's power more than earned through flawed choice under pressure. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("deepest motivation," "hollow space") and label-only emotion ("profound calm") at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied early, but his internal process operates at a remove—observing and interpreting rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in scene. The epiphany ("his core assumption shattered") arrives cleanly but feels more like intellectual reversal than emotional reckoning earned through on-page struggle. The Mrs. Gable memory introduces a second character only in reflection, sidestepping relational pressure. Micro-choices exist (raising the prism, tracing lines) but remain observational; no forked path with visible cost forces a hierarchy of values until the ending acceptance, which reads smooth rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in love across impossible distance, but her choices read as predetermined ritual rather than decisions under pressure. The "wistful" trait appears as a stable label rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The latent sacrifice unfolds with poetic inevitability but lacks genuine internal conflict—she never wavers, doubts, or makes a costly micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path. Interiority leans heavily on abstract emotion ("sorrow woven into the very set of her shoulders") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in devotion to place and memory, but his interiority often reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The bartered memory of his wife's laughter is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal conflicting pulls. The final transformation—"quiet determination tempered into calm confidence"—is declared but not earned through a visible struggle or renunciation that forecloses a competing path with felt cost. The piece avoids therapy-speak but leans on abstract emotional labels ("hope, sorrow, and quiet determination") at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her sensory-mapping vocation shapes perception consistently. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("cyclically spontaneous," "murmur of half-remembered dreams") that read more like prompt labels than lived experience under pressure. The final shift from "accusation to compassion" feels declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Kael's sacrifice is discovered but Elara's internal conflict around it remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is warmly characterized through his observational skills and silent grief, with embodied emotion ("warmth bloomed in his chest—a luminescent ache"). The motivation to protect the lighthouse legacy is clear and drives the stacking ritual. However, his choices are largely contemplative and ceremonial rather than under pressure; the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act feels inevitable but not earned through internal conflict or a difficult foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his accidentally prophetic attribute generates concrete on-page pressure when his laugh summons the storm. However, his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("shadowed elation," "quiet fire") rather than embodied contradiction—he moves through the crisis with near-perfect competence and no visible struggle between competing impulses. The final descent includes a "small, genuine smile" but no cost or foreclosed path is dramatized; the character arc reads as confirmation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is present and anchored in concrete sensory details (sun trail, morpho wing), but her motivation remains more contemplative than pressured. The donor heart premise supplies a unique lens, yet the interior contradictions remain abstract—"quietly explosive" is asserted rather than enacted through irreconcilable impulses in scene. Micro-choices (positioning the wing, following the light) are present but lack visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path. The final shift ("no longer seek to collect stories") reads as declared insight rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "discover what trees witness" is established early but remains largely abstract; the piece tells us she's obsessed without dramatizing internal conflict or showing her struggle under pressure. Her agency at closure—lifting the sextant and seeing the tableaus—feels passive, a witnessing rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final paragraph's claim that "her role had evolved" is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on elevated, therapeutic diction ("profound connection," "shared humanity") rather than embodied, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to rekindle the realm is clear, and her scattered memory creates internal tension. The ritual action shows embodied engagement—humming, kneeling, wrapping—but the memories surge without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; they arrive as needed rather than complicating her present choices. The final mosaic-mind settlement reads as summary rather than a cost-laden stance shift that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's empathetic nature is established through backstory (the thief incident) and drives her isolation, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ritual choice feels pre-determined rather than earned through competing impulses in the present moment. Her emotional progression—from shame to forgiveness—unfolds through passive observation of the gathering rather than micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost. The character remains coherent but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("quiet compass," soil-work as method), and her choices show agency (kneeling, planting, receiving the bread). However, the emotional arc is somewhat smooth—the tear at line 169 and the subsequent absolution feel preordained rather than contradictory or costly in the moment. The piece avoids therapy-speak, but the final progression from loss to resilience reads more like a staged emotional checklist than a lived struggle with messy irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—she works to preserve fading vows through measurement. Her "gently meticulous" nature is embodied in precise actions (tracing spines, securing the slide, recording values) rather than stated. However, she remains a single-note operator; no internal contradiction or competing impulse complicates her choices, and the ending offers no visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece reads as a portrait of competence without genuine struggle or change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and rooted in her father's legacy, with internal contradictions (protect the truce vs. document its fragility) driving her choices. The three interventions show tactical intelligence and micro-choices under pressure. However, the embodied emotion remains somewhat thin—her grief and resolve are stated more than enacted through contradictory impulses in the moment. The final realization about mending trust arrives cleanly but feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's skepticism is established and her journey toward acceptance tracks cleanly, with the grandmother's weather serving as both motivation and metaphor. The progression from doubt to understanding follows a clear arc, though the final epiphany arrives largely through passive reception rather than difficult choice. Embodied emotion appears in key moments (raindrop on wrist, tears tasting of lavender), but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical musing ("empathic conduits, their emotions resonating with Earth's consciousness") that flattens the immediacy of her transformation. The renunciation of skepticism carries emotional weight but lacks a visible on-page cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal state is anchored in grief and mnemonic gift, but the portrait-sketching climax unfolds without visible conflict between contradictory impulses—she retrieves charcoal and draws flawlessly under the weight of loss, yet no moment dramatizes hesitation, error, or embodied cost that would earn the final release. The pivot from suppressed creativity to surge relies on finding Lily's note rather than a choice Elara makes under pressure. Interiority leans on elevated phrasing ("phantom limb," "covenant renewed") that smooths rather than roughens emotional texture, and the ending's catharsis arrives via external gift rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization with visible friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early and her wilting response to dishonesty provides embodied constraint. The final acceptance of the neighbor's confession demonstrates earned agency, though the arc from isolation to receptivity relies heavily on exposition about what she "felt" in the chamber rather than dramatized internal conflict. The child and elder encounters function more as symbolic stations than genuine pressure points that force contradictory impulses to act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is established, but her agency is passive—she performs a ritual cycle already designed, with no on-page choice that forecloses a path or reveals contradiction. Seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a decision; it remains a label. The final peace and covenant lack dramatized cost; the piece tells us fulfillment rather than showing what she gives up or what competing impulse she overrides.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit Seven's motivation—resolving inner static—is clear and embodied through sensor notes and memory fragments. The nostalgic android premise risks sentimentality, but the piece grounds emotion in concrete action: retrieving the box, focusing light, observing ash. Internal contradiction is thin; the android moves smoothly from problem to solution without meaningful resistance or competing impulses. The final "fragmented wholeness" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost to its programming or purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated early but her choices remain passive observation rather than agentic decision under pressure. The "patient following" trait is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses; she gathers stories but never confronts a meaningful internal conflict that would foreclose a path. The final act—opening the locket—is purely mechanical, requiring no personal cost or sacrifice. Mr. Henderson's emotional release does more character work than Elara's arc, which flatlines at "quiet curator validates her belief."

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The dance moments feel ornamental rather than showing genuine internal conflict; when frustrated she dances and immediately gains clarity without visible struggle or cost. The final tear and smile read as labeled emotion rather than embodied contradiction. Interior voice relies on abstract metaphor ("loom weaving meaning," "silken thread") that distances rather than grounds her particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (finding deleted memories via Lyra's disappearance) is clear and emotionally grounded through the locket and pressed wildflowers. Her method of interpreting coffee grounds and navigating the chamber shows purposeful action under pressure. However, interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; the resolution feels delivered by the world's mechanics (salt yielding, gravity stilling) rather than earned through a difficult choice with visible cost. The sister's memory floods her senses but no present-moment trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquil blaze," "quiet urgency") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to silence the prophecy is declared but never tested by a meaningful on-page trade-off or conflicting impulse. The final "deep satisfaction" reads as label-only resolution without visible cost or foreclosed path. No secondary character pressure exists to complicate her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to learn building language is clear and rooted in Dr. Thorne's legacy, driving her archival quest. The shift from "interrogating stone" to "listening with compassion" is earned through Mrs. Davison's revelation about agreed-upon lies. However, interiority leans heavily on reflection and label-like insight ("empathy, not excavation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The tears and heart-full moment at closure feel somewhat announced rather than embodied through specific sensory contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is abstract and elevated throughout; labels like "ghostly resolve" and "spectral determination" replace embodied contradiction. The archiving ritual proceeds without visible internal friction or competing impulses—she executes the plan smoothly rather than wrestling with impulse versus intent. Micro-choices (humming the frequency, guiding energy) read as choreographed steps rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The transformation from isolation to independence is asserted in summary ("The weight of isolation dissolved") rather than earned through a dramatized renunciation or forfeiture with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is driven by guilt and the quest for forgiveness, but the emotional progression reads as linear summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The peak moment—"he forgave the rushed ink, the unintended consequence"—feels stated rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Backstory dominates (~40% of the text) yet anchors adequately to the present ritual; the piece meets the BRR reflection-led exception by interleaving Kael's memory with on-page actions (pressing the thorn, inserting the key). The final renunciation is legible but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; the chains "unlink" without dramatized struggle or trade-off in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and stated early, but her interior life relies heavily on elevated, abstract language ("richly perceptive nature," "reed-blown melancholy") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The key choice—to sing the truths—feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; she processes the shell's disclosures without visible internal conflict or cost. The final act of singing reads as a competent response rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—salvaging purity from wreckage—but her choices feel predetermined rather than genuinely pressured. The piece grants her full success without meaningful internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path; she completes her ritual, writes the letter, and receives affirmation without struggle. Interiority leans abstract ("her spirit felt unburdened, alight with purpose") rather than embodied contradiction. The final tear freezing is a gesture, but no competing impulse or mistake complicates her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philosopher's motivation to appreciate hidden effort is established through consistent internal monologue, and his actions (net-mending, tea preparation, whistling) align with this trait. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction—no competing impulses test his reverence under pressure. The final "truth" he carries feels declared rather than earned through dramatic cost; he observes and reflects but never faces a choice that forces renunciation or demonstrates visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established—debunker seeking truth—and the final renunciation is earned by on-page discovery. However, interiority leans toward abstraction ("crystalline moment," "profound truth") rather than embodied contradiction, and the arc from skeptic to guardian feels linearly executed without messier impulses acting simultaneously. The shift reads as epiphany more than struggle, weakening the sense of genuine internal conflict during the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority remains abstract—"quiet ferocity" and "decades of solitude" are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The broadcast sequence shows goal-directed action, but the choice to send the clear signal feels inevitable rather than earned by visible internal conflict. Hemlock and Lena offer brief secondary pressure, yet their responses are told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation is established early and his task with the music box progresses clearly, but interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("positively wistful tenderness," "gleaned redemption") rather than embodied contradiction. The past relationship with Elara is told in summary ("grief-stricken silence years ago") without dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in the present. The final emotional release feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the character's competence is never meaningfully challenged—he simply executes his ritual without friction or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "logically emotional" trait is demonstrated through diagnostic analysis + empathetic response, but the execution leans heavily on label-speak ("engineer's mind," "empathetic heart") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic vibrational matching sequence shows micro-adjustments (filing the tine) that reveal her values, yet the internal experience reads as cooperative duality rather than genuine friction. The ending forecloses her immediate duty with visible closure, but the cost feels light—no path is meaningfully renounced, no flaw confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal struggle between impatience and patience is embodied through concrete actions—breath, numb fingers, deliberate step. The transformation at closure (impatience dissolving into patience) is legible but arrives via external event rather than through a dramatized internal choice that forecloses a path. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("impatience hummed like a trapped bird," "internal forge") rather than staying rooted in embodied perception under pressure. The final gesture (palm on sigil) reads more as ritual completion than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (escaping the society) is clear and her investigative choices advance the plot, but her interiority is dominated by label-heavy abstractions ("watchful calm," "fortified vulnerability," "emotional turbulence") rather than embodied contradiction. The "empathetic imprints" mechanism feels convenient—she gains Thomas's final moments without dramatized struggle or misinterpretation. Her decision at closure (to expose the society) follows logically but arrives without visible cost or renunciation on the page; she simply resolves to act in the future.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt and motivation are clearly signaled, but the arc remains linear: he moves from passive guilt to passive acceptance without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic "realization" beat (207) is delivered as an abstract insight—"a seed to nurture into action"—rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final resolve to "offer second opinions" feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is present but not layered; Elias never wrestles between competing goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and remains consistent—ringing a bell for tomorrow's possibilities—but her interior life is largely told through abstract description rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. The relationship with the Algorithm is reverent yet playful, but this dynamic remains static; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears briefly at closure ("tears cutting clean paths through the grease"), yet much of the piece operates at a declarative distance that favors thematic assertion over lived contradiction. The final success arrives without meaningful struggle or foreclosed option, softening the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and motivated—her "brightly attentive nature" drives the investigation, and the choice to lie to Vance crystallizes under pressure. The final stance (guardian of intentional silence) is earned through escalating micro-choices. However, emotional embodiment is thin in peak beats; "tears traced Elara's cheeks" and "breath caught" feel stock rather than character-specific, and the shift from investigator to guardian lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves smoothly through discovery to acceptance without visible internal friction at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The peacekeeper remains an abstract vessel for thematic demonstration rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Their "calmly intuitive" nature is asserted repeatedly but never tested by genuine internal conflict—no moment where empathy costs them something visceral or where their shadow-nature creates friction with their task. The "courageous anomaly" label appears as exposition rather than earned struggle; we're told of their motivation but never see them weigh competing goods or falter under the weight of the orchard's terror. The final success feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking the blind spots or mistakes that would make their competence feel human.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior arc from seeking death's sound to honoring life's symphony unfolds through embodied moments (hands gripping nets, parasol tip warming). The transformation feels rushed in the final third, jumping from "choice remained hers" to full embrace of belonging without a dramatized pivot moment that forces cost. Internal contradiction is present (tourist vs. volunteer) but the climactic shift toward community reads more as emotional summary than earned crisis. Minor: "grips reality loosely" remains label-only without a concrete micro-choice where this trait creates visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to nurture intersubjective understanding") is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Clara and Liam's realizations arrive through told memory rather than on-page friction; their epiphanies feel granted rather than earned through scene pressure. The reconciliation hinges on exposition ("I thought fixing things was love") that explains rather than dramatizes internal conflict. Backstory summaries (vigil through mother's final nights, planting roses) replace present micro-choices that would reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—reverence for the echo—but his internal life remains abstract. The piece tells us he is "strangely honest" yet never dramatizes a moment where this trait creates friction or cost in his choices. Embodied emotion is scarce; "tear traced dust" and "joints aching" are the only physical anchors in a story dominated by elevated metaphysical description. No contradictory impulses appear; his reverence flows uncontested from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her role consistent, but interiority remains abstract—"quiet fire within" and "perceptively calm" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The arc from collective pain to healing is told through her facilitation rather than a personal choice with visible cost. Liam's moment ("He never showed us this part") provides embodied emotion, but Elara herself never confronts a meaningful internal conflict or makes a decision that forecloses a path. Secondary characters (Mrs. Gable, Mr. Higgins, teenagers) are functional but apply pressure only as receivers of her method, not as forces that test her.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's reticence and thirty-year dedication are established, but his interiority remains largely told rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to restore the crystal is presented as a serene conclusion rather than a moment of genuine internal conflict or cost. Emotional progression reads linear and contemplative without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would push this higher. The tears and "profound peace" feel asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "precognitively forgetful" condition is rendered concretely through sensory echoes ("scent of rain on hot pavement"), and the chalk-marking ritual demonstrates micro-choices under pressure. However, her grandfather remains an abstraction—his tapes and hope are told rather than tested against present conflict. The final choice to return at dawn feels like repetition rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost; the story asserts devotion without dramatizing what she sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is told rather than tested through contradictory choices under pressure. Her agency in the climax—the gentle recalibration—feels earned by her experience, but the interior work remains declarative ("deep space calm," "listening quiet of forty years") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final tears and "luminous ache" arrive as labels without preceding visceral struggle. The micro-choice at the climax (pressure "softer than breath") works, but earlier beats lack the friction of genuine doubt or competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her method (hymning the mundane) is character-specific, but her interiority remains thin—she enters, observes, executes her plan without internal friction or cost. Arthur and Lena show embodied grief (stone in throat, frayed voice), yet their arc feels passive: they receive the gift rather than making a choice that alters the outcome. The final reconciliation ("We'll keep listening") is tender but unmotivated by prior contradiction or renunciation; no path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's scholarly patience and meticulous nature are established through concrete action (sitting for hours with corrupted runes, precise chalk work). Her motivation is clear and her agency drives the closure—inserting the key, correcting the rune—with visible cost in three seasons of study consumed. However, interiority remains somewhat generic ("profound peace," "tears tracing clean paths") and her internal contradictions are minimal; she proceeds with competent certainty rather than wrestling with doubt or risk in the moment of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—proving Lyra was ill, not stolen—but the internal conflict remains abstract. The piece tells us she's a "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" rather than showing these traits constrain choices under pressure. Her discovery of the cleft in the tooth resolves doubt instantly without cost, and the final resolve to educate the village feels more like a summary of intentions than a choice that forecloses a path. The sob of "liberation" bypasses genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and anchored in Liam's trauma, but her interior life is too smooth—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's wisdom and Elara's resolve flow without friction or self-doubt. The final beats offer no micro-choice under pressure; she simply executes a preformed plan. Embodied emotion is present (stiff knee, hands working) but the polishing sequence never forces a trade-off or mistake that would reveal character under genuine stress.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (grafting new meaning) is present but interiority relies heavily on therapeutic abstraction ("raw, exposed nerves," "to graft new meaning onto old wounds"). The micro-choice—placing the pendant—is dramatized, but internal conflict remains declarative rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost (leaving the pendant) reads as symbolic release more than a foreclosed path with visible consequences. Embodied emotion is gestural ("thumb traced," "knelt") without visceral particularity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The novelist's internal state is heavily declared through abstract labels ("conflict within him settled into a quiet, purposeful peace") rather than embodied contradiction. His choice to "fight against the current of literary convention" is told as summary rather than dramatized through specific on-page decisions with visible cost. The "shapes of different hopes" collection method reads as ornamental observation—he witnesses cameos passively and presses a shell to his temple, but these acts don't force trade-offs or foreclose paths. The seashell placement at the end feels like symbolic gesture rather than a choice that alters his stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is sketched through costume details (spectacles, gears, pockets) but her interior remains generic and declarative ("motivation burned quiet but fierce"). The thirty years of research is told rather than shown; no micro-choice under pressure reveals her hierarchy of values or embodied struggle. The final tears are label-only and the story grants her total success without visible cost or trade-off, flattening what could have been an earned renunciation or difficult choice. Interiority reads as summary exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through deliberate action (kneeling, measuring placements, pressing palm to bark), and the ritual demonstrates internal coherence. However, interiority leans toward ornamental mysticism rather than contradictory impulses under pressure—she moves through the ritual without genuine friction or mistake. The biological heartbeat serves as an anchor, but no competing desire or fear threatens her commitment, reducing the felt stakes of the final choice. The ending grants transformation without visible internal cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and his method (peripheral vision, reflective diagnosis) constrains his approach, but the story lacks genuine struggle—every observation leads smoothly to the next insight without misstep or cost. The final repair feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory impulses or blind spots. Internal conflict is absent; Kael never wrestles with doubt, error, or competing desires. The character reads as a vehicle for the concept rather than a flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (to collect burdens) is clear and her task is legible, but interiority remains abstract—"flowing consciousness," "ancestral wisdom," and "whalebone reverie" label states rather than embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The childhood pebble memory adds compassion but arrives as exposition rather than friction that complicates a present choice. Her final solitude is asserted ("boundary-lessly trapped existence") without dramatized cost that forecloses a path. The weaving action demonstrates competence, but no blind spot or mistake creates genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "hauntingly practical" nature is demonstrated through her ritual and carving method, but her interior life is often articulated through diagnostic label-speak ("harvest lessons from loss," "containment was not suppression") rather than embodied contradiction. The memory of Leo tracing her scar provides a concrete moment, yet the steady accumulation of metaphorical self-knowledge ("she transformed absence into a quiet, guiding presence") reads more as summary than lived tension. No on-page choice forecloses a competing path with visible cost; the carving proceeds without friction or error, and the final sip of tea completes a ritual rather than a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority specific ("chronologically confused," "resolute spirit"), but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ghost negotiation unfolds through acceptance rather than genuine struggle between competing desires. The reconciliation moment ("Erosion is part of the art") feels epiphanic without the earned micro-choices that force her to confront what she truly wants versus what she fears. The final integration arrives smoothly but without the messy ambivalence that would raise the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's functionally creative attribute is shown through micro-choices (measuring angles with the sextant, redirecting water), and her motivation to puzzle out equations for hope drives the action forward. Her "stoic wonder" registers as embodied response ("breath caught," "tightened her throat") rather than diagnostic label. However, interiority leans abstract and lyrical—"mind that found poetry in stress calculations," "soul-stained boots"—without the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure that would push into higher bands. The final equation "hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow" reads as thesis statement rather than earned discovery through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured with embodied emotion (tear on cheek, trembling fingers), and the final shift from "haunted" to "harmonized" is motivated by the resonance experience. However, the epiphany relies heavily on abstract meditation ("not a betrayal of music, but its quiet cousin") rather than contradiction-in-action. The twenty-year gap and teenage tears are told rather than tested against present micro-choices that would reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand deception is established early and her internal arc—from chasing legends to becoming a "guardian of authenticity"—traces a clear path. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract exposition ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") rather than embodied contradiction; the moment of realization (discovering coordinates) feels more intellectual puzzle-solving than emotional reckoning with visible cost. Thorne's betrayal is recounted entirely in reflection without on-page friction or a present micro-choice that dramatizes her struggle between exposing him and moving forward. The final renunciation of vengeance reads as label ("She would not seek vengeance") rather than a decision with competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's infinite patience is shown through action (kneeling, tracing knots with "reverent focus"), and her motivation to preserve ancient methods drives her presence at the dock. However, her internal experience remains abstract; we see no contradictory impulses, no embodied cost of waiting, no micro-choice that reveals competing values. The fisherman's silent trust and final speech carry thematic weight but his interiority is inaccessible, flattening the interpersonal crucible. The ending realization ("To preserve ancient methods was the true treasure") borders on thesis-statement rather than dramatized shift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding healing's geography—but her interior life remains largely abstract. The piece relies heavily on reflective summary ("she sought not death's record but life's quiet reckonings") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment with Kael and the journal writing feel more like closure by assertion than earned transformation through dramatized struggle. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("the geography of healing," "sacred geography") appears frequently without concrete anchoring in sensory or behavioral specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's solitary devotion is consistently maintained, but his interior life reads as posed tableau rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The thirty-year arc is summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotion relies heavily on stock embodiment ("tears traced clean paths") and the final acceptance feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. The transformation from despair to purpose occurs through epiphany rather than costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is consistent—transforming fire's legacy through firefighting and compassion—but interiority leans heavily on abstract reflections ("duality she no longer fought," "unyielding compassion") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grafting ritual provides micro-choices (pressing coin, weaving thread) but these feel ceremonial rather than pressured decisions with visible cost. The father's memory surfaces with embodied detail (soot on cheek, scorched backyard) but the tear moment edges toward sentimentality without complication. Internal conflict is stated more than dramatized through competing desires colliding on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "luminous skeptic" nature produces some internal tension (evidence vs. hope), but interiority relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The quest proceeds through external puzzle-solving with minimal cost to her beliefs or hierarchy of values until the ending soft-lands into "steadfast knowing" without visible friction. Micro-choices at each fountain feel more like ritual completion than decisions that foreclose paths. The transformation from skeptic to keeper is told through metaphor rather than dramatized through a decision with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is asserted but her interiority reads abstract and label-driven ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "felt every potential outcome") rather than embodied. The ancestral lineage framework provides backstory texture but no on-page contradictory impulses; she proceeds methodically without genuine struggle or foreclosed alternatives. Her daughter is mentioned late as thematic garnish, not as a live pressure point that complicates choice. The final "adjustment" and "master ping" feel convenience-plotted rather than earned by prior cost or error.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her profession provides concrete grounding, but the emotional progression relies heavily on revelation rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The spectral mentor device reduces internal struggle—Lyra offers wisdom that Elara accepts without genuine friction or cost. The final memorial design emerges as insight rather than hard-won choice that forecloses a live path. Embodied emotion appears ("Tears traced warm paths") but the interiority often summarizes state ("fiercely meditative") rather than dramatizing simultaneous contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her diligent nature drives the clock repair—but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("ethically diligent," "quiet heartbeat") rather than embodied contradiction. The reverie sequence offers a moment of insight, but the epiphany about "incremental absolution" arrives through mystical vision rather than earned struggle on the page. The grandfather's rake-handle inscriptions provide specificity, yet Elara's own choice to continue this legacy feels stated rather than tested under competing pressures. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (hand trailing the railing, warmth of the handle), but the piece never forces her to sacrifice or renounce a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated early (to discover Albright's intentions), but her interior life remains thin. The "blithe spirit" and "tenderly organized" traits are label-only; they do not generate contradictory impulses or on-page tradeoffs under pressure. The final planting decision feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible cost or struggle. No secondary character applies live pressure; all conflict is solved through passive decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to seed innovation within this constraint") but her internal conflict is thin—doubt appears as a formulaic coil, is defeated via mental checklist, then vanishes. The piece tells us she "prevailed over uncertainty" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; the kingfisher reverence and data-gathering are exposition, not live choices under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; she arrives ready and remains ready.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior is evocative but leans heavily on abstract meditation ("teach dust to tell stories") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The core motivation—preserving forbidden narratives—is clear, but her choices lack visible trade-offs; she adjusts the cloak, transcribes, and imagines outcomes without on-page friction between competing desires. Embodied emotion appears in "pulse a frantic drum," yet much of the affective load rests on poetic assertion ("quiet fire in her chest") instead of dramatized struggle. The final choice to carry the journal forward feels anticipated rather than earned through a foregrounded internal conflict with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is nearly absent; her motivation is declared ("crystallization") but not shown as contradictory impulse under pressure. The piece tells us she "weaves truth carefully" and "understands her role," but we never see her wrestle with incomplete information in real time—no moment where she must choose between options or pay a visible cost for a micro-decision. The grandmother's grief is rendered through the mask, not through Elara's lived struggle, leaving characterization ornamental rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is concrete and crystalline throughout, and his internal conflict between revelation and preservation drives the tablet decision authentically. The "agonize immediately" moment (line 132) shows contradiction under pressure, and the final choice to hide the tablet forecloses the path of immediate truth-telling with visible cost. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally tilts toward diagnostic self-awareness ("rebellion was rational, not emotional") rather than fully embodied contradiction, though the core choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is present through her "expectantly resigned" posture and her observation of micro-shifts in the choir members, but her own internal conflict remains thin—she watches more than she wrestles. The secondary characters (Liam, Anya) show embodied emotion in small gestures (Anya's hum, Liam's nod), yet their arcs are told in summary ("Weeks passed...") rather than dramatized across distinct pressure points. The final exchange between Liam and Anya lands with warmth, but the lack of on-page struggle in those weeks keeps the transformation from feeling fully earned. Elara's motivations are consistent, but her choices do not visibly narrow options or foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlo's core motivation—creating beauty from ruins—is legible and his special ability (tasting memories via synaptic plasticity) shapes his approach. However, the pruning beats rely on near-identical structure: "he cut X, tasted Y memory," creating a loop that flattens contradiction. The final tears feel declared rather than earned by embodied struggle; the piece tells us he channels "joy, grief, love" without showing which impulse he resists or what internal cost the channeling exacts. No meaningful choice dilemma appears on the page—he never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's involuntary truthfulness is asserted but never tested on the page—no moment shows him compelled to speak truth at personal cost. His "crusade to preserve wonder" motivates the riddle method, but the choice to share versus withhold never creates visible friction. Dr. Aris functions as receiver, not pressuring force. The closure—Kael's satisfaction—rests on declaration rather than dramatized contradiction or embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior world is rendered through observations rather than micro-choices under pressure; she moves as a witness who documents rather than an agent who acts with visible stakes. The "hushed blaze of understanding" and "tears traced warm paths" label emotional states without embodied contradiction or cost that forecloses options. The motivation to understand why houses feel alive remains abstract and contemplative, never tested by a dilemma that would reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on elevated diction ("sanctifying spaces through displaced objects") that reads more like thesis than character-specific thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kael's motivation ("to welcome nuance") is stated but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible cost. His actions—projecting calm, pressing the ampoule—flow without internal friction or embodied emotion beyond "mineral tears," which reads ornamental. The revelations cascade through him rather than forcing him to choose between competing goods, leaving no dramatized change or renunciation with felt consequence. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("incisively kind precision," "profound tenderness") rather than concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and specific—capturing the sensory texture of a missed moment—and her "grim optimist" stance is illustrated through decades of proof-writing. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("profound ache of her silence") and label-speak ("quiet courage of remembrance") in the final third, reducing embodied emotion at peak beats. The change from isolation to "gentle peace" is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal conflict is summarized across time rather than dramatized within pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and her methodically hopeful attribute is embodied through ritual action. However, interiority leans toward abstract declaration ("quiet thesis etched into her soul") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice—placing the canvas and witnessing the nurse's response—feels more observational than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The tears at line 243 are labeled rather than embodied through specific physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent (rescue dying arts), but her characterization leans heavily on telling rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she discovers the silver-leaf carving provides a turn, yet her interior remains abstractly cultured rather than viscerally particular—"hope, sharp as a rose thorn" is asserted, not enacted through bodily reaction or micro-choice that costs her something. Old Man Hemlock's grief is more embodied ("tracing cold oven stones"), but secondary characters function primarily as recipients of Elara's insight rather than applying independent pressure. The final choice to bake is communal and feels inevitable once the herb is identified, reducing the protagonist's agency to facilitator rather than decision-maker with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her technical competence is shown through craft detail, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("quiet ferocity," "bleak exhilaration") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The tears at the climax are bodily but the emotional progression leading there feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices. No secondary characters appear to test her stance, and the final peace arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    The advisor's motivation is clear (trick fear into revealing weakness) and embodied through concrete actions with the dictionary and clasp. Interior texture leans heavily on decorative metaphor ("fingers, cold as forgotten coins") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—offering his own cursed emptiness—feels more announced than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The fear-entity's confession lands but the advisor's internal cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leeward's motivation is clearly stated but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. His actions flow mechanically from premise to execution without internal friction or micro-choices under genuine pressure. The final satisfaction ("quiet peace settling deep in his bones") reads as declared relief rather than earned cost. His grandmother's aphorism arrives as wisdom-dispensing rather than emerging from embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interior is concrete and character-particular: her "profoundly quietly driven focus" manifests in patient pattern-reading rather than engineering force, and the whistle functions as embodied memory. Her motivation to understand rather than conquer is consistently shown through micro-choices (arriving with patience, treating rust as text). The final threshold crossing enacts transformation with visible cost—she walks bearing "the solemn weight of lost voices"—but the piece leans heavily on reflective summary of the expedition rather than present contradiction, and the companions remain sketch-level presences whose loss we're told matters more than we feel it does.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aris Thorne's "emotionally rational" trait is labeled repeatedly but never tested under genuine pressure—he faces no internal contradiction, no cost for his choice, no moment where compassion wars with his historian's duty. The vow and parallel-drawing method remain assertions rather than embodied struggle. Eleanor Gable is mentioned only as an imagined reader, not as on-page friction. The piece tells us he "understood the compassion" and "felt sorrow for the comfort lost" without dramatizing those contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and sustained throughout, with embodied emotion in moments like "ink blurred by unshed tears." However, the character reads more as a vessel for thematic delivery than a person under genuine pressure—his "stoically sensitive" nature is stated repeatedly rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The notes he inscribes feel like ritual performance rather than choices that foreclose other paths with visible cost. His interior remains steady and reverent without the messy friction that would make the final act feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—verifying whether the Charter erases the Deep-Singers—but her execution reads as competent puzzle-solving without meaningful internal friction or cost. The character demonstrates observational skill ("tranquilly perceptive" label recurs) but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously; she moves from hypothesis to confirmation in a steady line. The final "quiet victory" and "chest tight" are asserted emotions rather than embodied struggle. Micro-choices exist (using the blank stamp end, not the carved face) but they feel like methodical steps rather than decisions that foreclose live alternatives or reveal competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation—to transform grief by folding it into cranes—is clear and drives her actions through polishing, recording, and folding. The shadow detachment is offered as backstory, creating an emotional anchor, but interiority leans toward abstraction ("quiet, desperate alchemy," "visceral recollection") rather than embodied contradiction. The final tear and acknowledgment offer a credible micro-shift, though the choice to continue folding feels more like reaffirmation than genuine transformation with foreclosed paths. The piece stays within BRR allowances and ties reflection to present micro-choices, but the closure moment lacks the visceral cost that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior grief and her methodical hunt are embodied through scarred fingers and the geode's tactile presence. The perturbation experiment and the vision of stolen possibilities feel concrete, though the leap to "understanding her survival" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or micro-choice friction. The final stance ("to carry this map within her") emerges more from realization than from a forfeiture that narrows options. Backstory (wedding strike, Liam's loss) anchors her present action but occupies ~25% without altering a present tactic until the vision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation—"the frequency of belonging"—is abstractly articulated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from sharp-edged isolation to quiet warmth reads as smooth emotional arithmetic without genuine struggle. Elara's "perpetually surprised" trait is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it functions as a label rather than a living contradiction. The hand-holding resolution delivers closure without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing need abandoned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his guilt is embodied through physical action (tracing carvings, clutching the watch hand). Internal conflict exists but operates through alternating reflection rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to confess is prepared by prior causality, but the decision itself occurs off-page ("At dawn, he would…"), with the cost deferred rather than made visible in the closure moment. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally veers toward abstraction ("hollow ache," "storm of regret").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a concrete past failure (Veridian Pass, three lives lost) and carries the drawer pull as a tactile anchor. His internal state—transforming guilt into protocol—is embodied through gesture and object handling. However, the interiority leans heavily on summary and reflective exposition rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the piece tells us he has "recycled mistakes into wisdom" without dramatizing a live struggle or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values under present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arlo's motivation is signaled early and his internal contradiction—mistrust of his compass versus love for navigation—drives the pivot at Widow's Point. The backstory block is substantial (~20%) but anchors in present stimuli (the compass, the poles) and tilts his stance through micro-choices (wiping dew, securing the compass). Interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing ("backlash of regrets," "merrily melancholic") that reads more like prompt echo than embodied thought. The final choice to navigate by stars again is earned by the prior causality and forecloses his penance-only path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to kindle empathy is clear and intensifies across the journey. However, the transformation from ruthless saboteur to empathetic witness arrives via facilitated epiphany rather than earned struggle—the lake's light does the integrative work while Kael passively receives it. The memories of David Chen and Sarah Vance provide concrete embodiment of past harm, but the shift from "holding these truths...with aching, compassionate understanding" reads as declared rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The tremor and chilling void establish physical markers, yet the procedural clean slate creates a motivation paradox: he seeks empathy where "none remained," yet the prose claims empathy "used to live," undermining the premise's internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (reforging bond with Kael) is clear and her actions proceed logically toward the ritual, but interiority remains abstract—"raw, persistent ache" and "hollow space beneath her ribs" are stock body metaphors without particularized contradiction. The metamorphosis is declared ("reluctant metamorphosis she feared would erase the very self he loved") but not embodied through micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation into intertwined saplings forecloses her original form with cost, yet the choice itself unfolds as smooth inevitability rather than genuine struggle, and the ending asserts harmony ("not lost herself, but expanded") without visible ambivalence or friction that would ground the claim.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—seeking where lost time accumulates after her daughter's birth—but her internal arc flattens into abstraction. The opening establishes her cartomancer identity and ink-stained hands, yet no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; she moves through ritual without friction. The epiphany ("lost time...accumulates in fractures") arrives through meditative vision rather than earned struggle, and the "willingly perplexed" stance functions as a label that insulates her from genuine dramatic tension. The tear on the saucer and thumb-press gesture supply embodied moments, but the resolution—warmth melting anxiety—reads as convenient emotional release without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's pacifist stance and compassion motivation are established early, but her choices feel pre-determined rather than tested under opposing pressure. The shadow-work integration sequence shows embodied emotion ("breathed into the discomfort") and the levitation attribute provides concrete physicality, yet the character arc reads more as a spiritual ascent than a dialectic struggle—no moment where pacifism itself is challenged or costs her something she values. Internal contradiction appears mainly as catalogued griefs rather than competing impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The release of the bugs reads as a gesture toward understanding rather than a choice earned by dramatized internal conflict. Her "destitute philanthropist" trait functions mainly as backstory label; the on-page action (releasing bugs) doesn't force a meaningful trade-off between competing goods. Mano appears only as witness, adding no pressure to Elara's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his actions consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("calmly inventive," "quiet motivation") rather than embodied contradiction. The mechanical step-by-step execution (descending, kneeling, adjusting, crushing) reads competent but lacks genuine internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance is earned by prior setup, but the journey feels more like confident execution than struggle with visible cost in his thought-process.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her goal-driven actions (gathering stones, chanting equations) advance the plot, but internal contradiction is absent—she experiences doubt via precognitive vision yet proceeds without meaningful friction between impulses. The moment she kneels and weeps is embodied and specific, but the emotional arc is too smooth: moving from curse-haunted wariness to reverent purpose without the ambivalence or self-deception that would elevate this to high-band characterization. The final identity shift ("pattern keeper, the bridge between loss and dawn") feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the precognitive curse functions mostly as atmospheric texture rather than a source of genuine internal conflict that complicates her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is present but interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("furiously tranquil," "unuttered truths"). The letter discovery triggers tears, but the emotional progression feels telescoped—sob to storm-washed peace within a few beats—without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Micro-choices (smoothing pages, breaking the seal) exist but her internal stance shifts via summary ("understanding dawning") rather than dramatized friction. The final writing act is told, not shown with visible cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's core motivation and mechanical arm are established, but her interior life remains abstract through most of the piece. The "diplomatically fierce" trait is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic decision—preparing to extend a hand—feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible struggle that forecloses another path. Interiority leans heavily on elevated philosophical abstractions ("confluence," "sacred nexus") that read as authorial rather than character-specific thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's monthly molt creates embodied tension ("chest tonight") and the final seed-planting choice feels earned by prior causality. However, interiority often defaults to abstract poeticism ("alchemy: to forge enduring beauty") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The molt's mechanics—sharp edges softening like frost—are told more than dramatized through micro-choices that test commitment. Kael's consistent warm presence anchors the relationship, but his role tilts toward supportive witness rather than applying immediate counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—strategically creative grief-work—is coherent and her choice to enter the arbor is earned, but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("steely longing," "strategically creative") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final laugh and "renewed purpose" feel declarative rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Leo's spectral appearance offers closure, but the protagonist's transformation reads more as relief than a genuine foreclosure with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized more than dramatized at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and stated early, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously. The choice to plant the seed feels more dutiful than torn; no competing impulse creates friction in the moment. The flood of collective memory at closure is told through a catalog of sensory fragments rather than a single contradictory reaction that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority is present and the compass ritual shows purposeful action, but the emotional arc relies heavily on told reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "cerulean regret" epiphany arrives through the compass mechanism rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the final acceptance feels declarative ("We carry all colors of our past") rather than embodied in a choice with visible cost. Backstory dominates the middle third without micro-choices that alter present tactics, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Aris's shift from clinical detachment to humble observation is earned through concrete micro-choices; his internal contradiction (dismissing vs. being held by the dust) and final renunciation of control carry visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with her "steadily adaptive resilience" embodied in her raw hands and her climactic decision to transform the ledger. The final choice—to encase, not destroy—feels earned by her artistic nature and the night's reflections. However, some interiority edges into abstract, diagnostic language (e.g., "purpose crystallized," "shift in understanding"), slightly distancing the reader from raw, embodied emotion at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, and her micro-choices under pressure are consistent. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents the highest band. The connection with Liam is earned with visible cost, but internal conflict is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in concrete actions and a quiet vow. His inadvertently stubborn nature surfaces in a key micro-choice (tightening grip on the lens), aligning with his overarching desire to give rest. However, the absence of on-page contradictory impulses during the inciting decision slightly limits the interior conflict, capping below the 9+ threshold despite a strongly earned final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, her gentle persistence embodied in methodical actions. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her role, though peak emotional beats lean slightly toward lyrical summary rather than raw, contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to sound the bell is earned by prior causality of built trust, with visible cost in the risk of breaking their sanctuary of quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's spiritually curious motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through concrete actions like assembling the camera and controlled breathing. Her internal shift from hollow ache to quiet purpose is earned by on-page causality, with visible cost in the transformed viaduct and her filled hollow space. The final renunciation—seeing love as potential, not debt—lands with felt weight. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are specific and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief and intellectual quest, compelling her final act of surrender. Interiority is concrete through tactile interactions with photographs and the garden. The final choice—releasing the memory—feels earned by her decades of study and longing. However, some emotional descriptions verge on abstract labels (e.g., "quaking reverie," "trembling reverie"), slightly dulling the embodied peak.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is a quiet ember embodied in steady purpose; her strategic patience earns the decisive change with visible cost as chains transform into roots.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and change earned, but interiority occasionally slips into poetic abstraction rather than concrete, character-particular embodiment during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and her internal shift from thief to participant is earned through on-page micro-choices (using the jar, altering the arrangement). Contradictory impulses—thief vs. seeker—act in scene, and her final renunciation of the train path carries visible cost in her tear and steady steps. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., tear through soot); final choice to abandon flawed glass is earned by prior causality (bookmark's message) with visible cost (weight lifting), meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interior conflict between phobia and protective instinct is embodied and drives micro-choices; her final stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Slight deduction for occasional label-like phrasing ("transformative betrayal") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene; her mild obsession is shown through precise actions without on-page struggle, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit Seven's motivation to discover the origin of thought is clear, concrete, and drives every on-page choice.

Interiority is concrete and embodied in fine scars, grime, and the visceral wilt. The final choice—enduring to sing radical acceptance—is earned by prior causality and shows a credible renunciation.

Her motivation evolves credibly from archiving to cultivation, a final renunciation earned by the preceding convergence of memory and artifact.

    Elara's guilt is a credible, concrete motivation that compels her choices; her micro-choices (uncorking the bottle, playing the piano) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final apology and acceptance are earned by the scene's causality.

    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in sensory-specific traits, and her emotional progression is embodied (tears, skin sensations). The final acceptance is earned by the journey's tactile cost. Slight lean toward diagnostic interiority ("emotional depths") prevents a higher score.

His internal conflict—between his destructive history and reverent present—is embodied in micro-choices like handling the tapestry fragment "with volcanic tenderness."

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied contradiction ("auroral sorrow" warring with joy). The final resolve to continue is earned by the cost of the dream's transience, visible in tears and deepened sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation clear and embodied, but lacks internal conflict or flaws, making character idealised without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)

Micro-choices under pressure reveal values: Elara's arrangement is her "native tongue," Kael's decision to play the reed is an earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is a clear, quiet fire that compels her through the ritual's high-stakes emotional navigation. Interiority is concrete and embodied (sweat dampening her veil, breath deliberately uneven), and her final stance—holding "anguished joy" without resolution—is a meaningful change earned by the on-page struggle with the core memory. The fracturing of her own innocence is a visceral cost that anchors her transformation from keeper to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation ("to preserve the shape of hope") is clear, rooted in her history, and intensifies under the pressure of the shadow's appearance. Her internal conflict—clinging to stasis versus accepting evolution—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (investigating footage, placing the stone). The final renunciation of her static belief is earned by the causal chain of her investigation. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of "luminous regret," which edges toward diagnostic label-speak at the peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied; her internal conflict between compassion and self-protection drives the story, and her final choice to modify the sanctuary is earned through the detailed shedding process.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation (reading scars) is concrete and drives micro-choices (leaning to study the coffee ring). Her final renunciation—honoring the scar instead of probing it—is earned by the causal chain of plant-telepathy visions, with the cost being the abandonment of her lifelong method. Interiority is specific and embodied ("protest of her stitches"). The contradictory impulse of a closure-seeker who opens wounds is dramatized, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and clear motivation, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws that would elevate to exceptional. Final realization is earned, yet Elara's competence remains steady without significant struggle.

    Elara's guilt is embodied through nerve pain and specific memory; her final choice to memorialize Kael is earned by the discovery of the bolt and chamber, foreclosing the path of continued silence with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and his regally unpretentious trait is demonstrated through action (mending charts). However, his pivotal action—the unmasking—is executed off-page by Elara, reducing his on-page agency and the visible cost of his choices. His interiority is consistent but lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied stress under pressure that would elevate the score. The final renunciation of the throne is thematically coherent but feels more like a stated outcome than an earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; interiority is embodied (e.g., "quiet, persistent ache").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's interior contradiction (mechanic vs. mystic) is concrete, and his final resolve is earned through embodied experience with the stone circle. However, the epiphanic shift ("understood the lull not as surrender...") arrives as a summary of insight rather than a dramatized micro-choice under immediate pressure, slightly distancing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's characterization is concrete and consistent, with clear motivation and micro-choices under pressure. However, the closure cost, while felt, is positive vindication rather than sacrifice, preventing the highest band.

    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (freeze into grounding) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation/endurance (tucking photo as testament, not trigger) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of loss. Minor hairline slip: occasional therapy-speak ("integration," "somatic markers") edges toward diagnostic label, but is dramatized within the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kael's interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; his transformation from despair to purpose is earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure, with visible cost in the final ache. No diagnostic label-speak; motivation intensifies credibly.

Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through her "chaotically precise" arrangement and the visceral reception of memories.

Her discovery and persuasion of Hemlock show micro‑choices under pressure, and the final communal action is earned by prior causality. A slight abstract note in the hope metaphor is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation burns with quiet ferocity, rooted in her life's work and embodied in micro-choices (tracing the window, steady hands). The final choice—initiating the reversal—is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in her tears of "bleak exhilaration." Contradictory impulses (somber history vs. thrilling revolution) act simultaneously in the scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The advisor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing the clasp and consulting the dictionary.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Leeward's motivation is clear and embodied, driving his actions consistently. The closure choice is earned by his prior efforts, with visible cost in his physical exertion. However, internal contradiction is minimal, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's quietly driven focus is consistently shown and motivates her meticulous study; the final step through the gate is earned by her prior loss and understanding, with visible cost in tears and the weight of lost voices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Aris's emotionally rational nature is concretely embodied in his balanced empathy and scholarly precision, driving his vow to rescue truth. Interiority is specific, as seen in his "bittersweet passing of a comforting myth," with micro-choices like unrolling the letter under damp chill revealing his values. The final renunciation of the lie is earned by prior parallels, carrying visible cost in the loss of comfort for integrity. No contradictory impulses act in scene, but his steadfast resolve is character-consistent and costs are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; his interiority is concrete and his stoically sensitive nature is shown through action. The final choice (completing the ritual) is earned, though contradictory impulses are minimal within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice is earned by prior discoveries. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or visible personal cost, and her tranquil perceptiveness remains one-note under pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's grief is embodied through concrete actions (polishing, folding) and internal contradiction between craft precision and hollow heart. The final choice to continue folding is an Earned Stasis with visible cost in the tear, earned by the preceding ritual. Motivation is clear and intensifies under the accumulative pressure of the process. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's guilt is embodied and his contradictory impulses (seeking solace vs. avoiding truth) are dramatized. The final vow to confess is earned by the watch-hand discovery, with cost legible in "the heavier, holier weight of honesty." Minor cliché ("hollow ache") does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, with interiority embodied through the drawer pull; his shift from shame to wisdom is earned, though some diagnostic self-awareness slightly softens the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Arlo's characterization is concrete and particular; his interior contradiction (earthbound penance vs. love for the stars) acts simultaneously in scene. His final choice to use the compass again is earned by the crisis of the poles ending, with visible cost (tears, trembling). The return of his "merrily melancholic" smile is a credible, embodied emotional progression rooted in specific micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's interior contradiction—between his sterilized consciousness and ghost of past betrayals—is embodied in physical tremors and void. His motivation to kindle empathy drives micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a earned transformation at the lake where he holds memories "with aching, compassionate understanding." The final choice to place the baseball is rooted in prior causality with visible cost (tears washing numbness). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through concrete perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied; her final choice to surrender her gift is earned by prior causality with visible cost (loss of self, transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and rooted in postpartum guilt, with embodied emotion ("icy knot of anxiety") and a credible arc from perplexity to release. The final choice—pressing her thumb over the crack—is earned by her "willingly perplexed" stance, foreclosing doubt with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's steadfast pacifism and compassionate motivation are embodied through concrete micro-choices (breathing into discomfort, stitching photographs) that earn the decisive change. Her interior contradiction—integrating grief and joy—drives the climax with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The gravitational-lightness trait is a unique, character-particular expression of emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and concrete, driving her to the climactic release; interiority is embodied (e.g., "heart swelling with bittersweet joy"), and the final choice is earned by her quest, though her characterization leans slightly allegorical, which slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael's calm inventiveness and secret motivation are consistently embodied in his precise actions, and his final choice to spark the revolution feels earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the internal conflict between duty and rebellion is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The micro-choices with the quill and sundial reveal a clear hierarchy of values, and the closure shows a meaningful change with implied risk as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past and curse; interiority is concrete (cherishing memory of friction, vision of failure). Micro-choices under pressure (anchoring breath against vision) reveal values. Final endurance and deepened understanding are earned by prior causality with visible cost (aurora dims, star dust lightens). Contradictory impulses act in scene: her curse shows failure, yet she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's "furiously tranquil" contradiction is embodied, and her shift from suspended vigil to active writing is earned by the letter's revelation and emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation and interiority are concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (welcoming the breeze as a variable). The final shift to collaboration is earned by the decoding, but contradictory impulses are absent, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's interior contradiction (fear of molt vs. necessity) is concretely embodied, and her final acceptance is earned through Kael's intervention. The relationship with Kael acts as a crucible, forcing a stance crystallization. Minor deduction for slightly diagnostic phrasing around the molt ("psychic tremor," "vulnerability").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s characterization is specific and coherent: a man trained to model cosmic violence, trying to apply that same preprocessing habit to grief. His motivation shifts credibly from “assess with clinical detachment” to “student of patience,” and his micro-choices (returning with a magnifying glass, choosing to repair the roof as “facilitating”) track that arc. The internal conflict between stripping drama and allowing meaning is present, though sometimes summarized rather than dramatized. The epiphany edges toward neatness but is mostly earned by accumulated observation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s craft, trauma, and resilience are clearly rendered, and her decision to transform the ledger into art is motivated by the loss of her studio and her evolving understanding of what the ledger represents. Her interiority is specific to her profession (light, glass, fire) and embodied in details like scraped hands and smoke-tasting lungs. However, her emotional journey moves fairly cleanly from shock to clarity without much on-page contradiction or messy ambivalence, which slightly flattens the arc. The final renunciation of victimhood feels earned but almost too tidy for the extremity of what’s just happened.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute traumatic silence into a different kind of “music”—is clear, embodied through ritual with the tuning fork and her wordless invitations. Her interiority is mostly conveyed via action and perception rather than labels, which works well for a mute, traumatized character. Liam is thinner but still registers as a distinct, wounded presence whose response to the glass feels credible. The main limitation is a relative lack of contradiction or shadow in Elara; her change at the end feels slightly idealized rather than fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is specific and coherent: a weary, ritual-bound custodian whose vow and “inadvertently stubborn nature” credibly drive his decision to keep and use the lens. His motivation to give “rest a permanent address” is clear and consistently dramatized in his meticulous work with the shards. The main limitation is that conflicting impulses (duty to procedure vs compulsion to answer distress) are named more than they are truly put under pressure on the page. The final sense of quiet triumph reads earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara, Lena, and Master Lin are all clearly motivated, with Elara’s leadership and intergenerational aims consistently embodied in her actions. The elder–youth pairings and the moment when Lena steadies Lin give the relationships real specificity and tenderness. However, Elara’s interior conflict is underdeveloped; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt under pressure. The final choice with the bell feels earned but emotionally smooth, with limited visible cost or ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular (a camera obscura artist seeking the repository of unused love), and her actions—following sparks, assembling the obscura, committing to the breath ritual—align well with that drive. Interiority is sensuous and grounded in perception, but her emotional life is largely unconflicted; we don’t see strong contradictory impulses or genuine resistance as she moves toward healing. The past-life regret is vivid as premise, yet it functions more as backdrop than as an active, complicating force in the present scene. Her final shift from seeker to vessel of compassion feels earned but relatively smooth, with limited sense of cost beyond quiet sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand the texture of time and free herself from Aris’s ghost) is clear and consistently dramatized through her reverent engagement with the garden and the halo fragment ritual. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“absence tighten around her heart like ivy”), and the shift from grief to connectedness reads earned rather than sudden. However, internal contradiction is relatively muted—she rarely seems genuinely torn or at risk of failing to release the fragment, which slightly flattens the emotional stakes. The relationship with Aris functions more as a memory axis than a present crucible, limiting on-page relational tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent—twelve years of vigilant guardianship culminating in a calm, decisive act—but she reads more as an archetype than a fully contradictory human being. Her "quiet ember" and "monastic devotion" are well dramatized through the key-decoding and patient waiting. However, we rarely see her under genuine emotional strain or in tension between competing impulses; she moves from clarity to execution with little visible inner mess. The realization that her chains were "roots" is conceptually strong but lands as an almost perfectly tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to locate “the sound of trust breaking” linked to her father’s lie—is vivid, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her interiority feels embodied through synesthetic perception and the ache around absences, with a credible shift from haunted fixation to a more integrated acceptance. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (need to know vs. need to be free of the pain) stays somewhat smooth, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage under peak pressure. Still, the closing reorientation of her work and listening habits reads earned rather than proclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and history are cleanly established, and her internal shift from thief/observer to author/participant is convincingly earned by the floral-code revelation and her final choice to take the forest path. Her emotions are mostly embodied in concrete perception of light, petals, and objects rather than labels. The main limit is that her doubt or resistance rarely complicates the final epiphany—she moves fairly smoothly from insight to acceptance without much in-scene pushback. Still, the felt cost of turning away from the midnight train (and her old life) gives the arc credible weight at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to create “safe zones for inquiry” and to metabolize grief—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices, especially in abandoning the flawed vessel and reframing the bookmark. Interiority is specific and textured (“her own heart had been ice-locked since the library’s flood”), with credible contradictory impulses: urge to abandon everything versus the decision to release only what “no longer served the light.” The emotional change feels earned and grounded in concrete tasks rather than abstract realization. The arc edges toward tidiness, with a near-textbook resolution of her flaw in a single session, which slightly undercuts messier human ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s fear/protective drive is well-motivated and consistent, with her claustrophobia and betrayal concretely shaping choices, especially when she chooses to stay and act rather than flee. The relationship with Lily develops credibly fast under pressure, with specific gestures (kneeling, decoding the cast together) selling the bond. However, phrases like “firmly adaptive nature” and the neat final self-definition (“authentically whole”) feel closer to thematic summary than lived interiority. The emotional arc is strong but slightly over-tidy for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are sharply defined and consistently dramatized, and her “mild obsession” with mapping silence is credible and specific. However, she experiences almost no on-page contradictory impulses or real emotional friction; her focus never meaningfully costs her anything or clashes with other desires. The interiority is vivid but largely unidirectional—devotion, absorption, quiet satisfaction—so the final peace feels like a continuation rather than a hard-earned turn. This keeps the arc from rising to truly elite character work.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit Seven’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—its drive to locate the origin of thought is well seeded and directly informs its choice to break protocol and engage with the violin. Interiority is concrete for a non-human consciousness, with sensory recall across loops serving as an embodied emotional analogue. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the robot remains serene and curious throughout, so its arc feels more like a smooth clarification than a pressured change with visible cost. The resolution is credible but a bit tidy, with enlightenment arriving without much on-page struggle or error.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her shift from passive registrar to active projector is credibly seeded in her nightly habits. Kael is sketched efficiently through his doodles and brief on-page appearance, but remains more emblem than fully embodied person. Internal contradiction is light: Elara’s “quiet fire” never truly clashes with fear or doubt on the page, so her key choice carries less visible cost than it could. The relationship does change meaningfully, yet with minimal struggle or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and coherent—her age, bodily detail, and rituals make her feel specific, and her calm defiance with Kael aligns with the earlier “soil over silicon” stance. Motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (ignoring her meter, tending the phoenix vine, using the marble to free Kael) all reinforce that. What’s missing, given the bar, is real internal contradiction or visible cost; she never seems genuinely torn or endangered. Kael works as a foil but is somewhat flat and purely emblematic of the opposing worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation and inner stance are clear and consistent—his mix of humility, reverence, and quiet obsession reads specific, and his doubt before pulling the lever is a credible internal counterforce. However, his flaw-set is soft; he’s almost entirely noble and competent, so pressure doesn’t expose many contradictions beyond hesitation. The relationship with Dr. Aris pays off nicely at the end but isn’t truly a crucible; she validates rather than challenges him in scene. The final reorientation from “prove” to “listen” feels earned but low-cost, more gentle realization than hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—unraveling the Maestro’s code and answering the ghost—is clear, consistent, and drives every on-page choice. His interiority is mostly expressed through sensory attention and reverence rather than explicit thought, which fits the tone but dampens visible inner contradiction. The key change (from obsessive seeker to keeper of a “sacred trust”) is earned by the interaction with the watermark and the sustained note. However, the lack of strongly dramatized ambivalence or flaw under pressure keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her professional identity as a “fault-tolerant oracle,” and her guilt over Kael’s death feels psychologically credible. The story dramatizes her contradiction—need for flawless certainty vs. growing reverence for “whispers in the margin”—through concrete perception of the smudge and hidden bud. Her final stance shift (from prediction/control to witness/acceptance) is earned by prior beats and framed as a real cost: she must fully acknowledge her culpability. The only slight limitation is that the breakthrough comes smoothly, with little on-page resistance once the memory surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Leo’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in a believable mix of recklessness, skepticism, and sudden filial urgency, and his shift from hollow drive to grace and resolve feels earned by the discovery of the beads. The interiority is concrete (“drowsy alertness,” “calloused hand closing around the cold, beaded spokes”) and mostly avoids stock emotion labels. The grandfather’s off-page presence and faith are effectively refracted through Leo’s discoveries. The one soft spot is how cleanly his epiphany telescopes a very complex emotional recalibration into a few explanatory sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to witness transformation without judgment—is clear, consistent, and filtered through specific behaviors (moving in response to the river, inscribing the chronicle, her non-reactive attention to cracks and decay). Her interiority is strong but largely non-contradictory; she is serene and accepting throughout, so we get little genuine internal conflict or felt cost to her stance. The slight reweighting at the end (recognizing the library as “evolving” and naming “hope”) is credible but emotionally low-temperature. This limits the depth of character change even though the portrayal itself is assured and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly and consistently drawn—mellow, attentive, with a well-rooted motivation to rekindle wonder—and her choices (mirroring his breath, offering the curl, timing her words) align with that. Liam, though less interior, has a believable emotional trajectory from shut-down to awe, with the tear and spiderweb moment giving him some individuality. However, there’s little sense of genuine internal contradiction or misstep in Elara; she operates almost as an idealized healer, which flattens potential complexity. Occasional therapy-adjacent abstractions (“softly adaptive awakening”) distance us from more embodied, character-particular emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The historian is clearly motivated by his vow and defined by his hyper-attunement, and his choices (to preserve Elara’s story, to “press a palm to the cool metal wall”) align with that. However, he experiences little overt internal contradiction or dilemma; he endures rather than struggles. The emotional life is rich but mostly one-note—reverent, melancholy, dutiful. Character is vivid and particular, but the lack of tension within him holds this short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s motivation—regret over estrangement and longing for reconciliation—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices from microdot scheming to open apology. His internal contradiction between control (spycraft, orchestration) and vulnerability (speaking "I am sorry") lands as an earned shift. Elara is less textured, mostly a foil for his change, but her stone and single articulated need ("I just needed to hear you say you were sorry") give her enough specificity to feel real. The relational turn from manipulation to honesty forecloses his old tactics credibly, with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation and method are sharply defined, and his role as “loop pedal priest” feels specific rather than generic. Elara’s despair and isolation are legible through concrete details (white-knuckled grip, single cobalt hue), but her interiority is relatively thin for a possession-level crisis. Her turn from near-possession to reclaiming agency feels a touch easy, with little visible internal struggle or contradictory impulse on the page at the decisive moment. The relationship dynamics are clear and functional, but not yet deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and particular—her “chronological homesickness” and fortune-cookie day job sharply ground her. Her micro-choices (climbing before dawn, stopping when dizziness hits, reorienting her fortunes after the ritual) arise credibly from those traits. The main limitation is the relative smoothness of her inner conflict: there’s not much active contradiction between impulses on the page, only the fatigue constraint. The final shift from ache to “purposeful joy” feels earned, but it comes with minimal visible cost beyond tiredness.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to escape the self-made loop and integrate her fractured selves) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to let the tablet fall differently feels earned. The centuries of repetition, the seventy-three prior attempts, and her shift from defiance to grace show credible internal conflict. However, interiority leans on abstract, almost therapeutic language (“labyrinth of self,” “integrated strength”) rather than more idiosyncratic, embodied detail, which slightly blunts her specificity. The emotional turn to self-forgiveness is persuasive but arrives a touch too fluently articulated for the magnitude of the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—defeating her emotional numbness through some remaining form of music—is clear, particular, and consistently drives her choices from the journey to the cavern through accepting Kael’s method. Her emotions are convincingly embodied in tactile experiences and the fracture into tears during the drum sequence feels earned rather than declared. The relationship with Kael is quiet but effective as a crucible, his pressure coming through guidance rather than overt conflict. The one limitation is an underplayed internal contradiction; we see pain and longing but little hesitation or resistance that might complicate her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is strong and specific—methodical, storm-obsessed, and disciplined, with her choice to treat the clay as “datum” rather than threat feeling rooted in long-practiced rigor. Her motivation (“to nurture integrity in solitude”) clearly governs her micro-choices, especially the decision to send an even more incriminating message. The main weakness is a near-absence of contradictory impulses under pressure—she moves from unease to clarity with little real wobble, which flattens her humanity slightly. A touch more visible fear or temptation to self-protect would deepen the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, sensibility, and “aromatically cautious” nature give her a distinct, coherent psychology, and her choice to risk the vial feels motivated by the ache to understand her reactions. The grief sequence is embodied and specific (teak bench, moth-wing voice) rather than purely labeled. The internal shift from avoidance to acceptance is clear and earned, though her final reframing of tears borders on tidy insight rather than genuinely conflicted ambiguity. A bit more simultaneous push-pull—wanting revelation while half-hoping it fails—would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and specific—his drive to “discover the very texture of time itself” credibly collides with his reverence for the rope and its history. His ethically playful trait is dramatized through his refusal of the binary choice and invention of a “third path” with the rope. Emotions are embodied in small, concrete ways (dust-tracing tear, fingers in clay) rather than generic labels. The only limit at this tier is that his flaw or blind spot under pressure (beyond idealism) remains a bit protected and never truly risks uglier self-interest.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (seeking beauty in the unfinished and unbinding sound from silence) is clear and consistently expressed, and her acoustic sensitivity is well-rooted in both backstory and present choice. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tears traced clean paths through ash”), with a distinctive sensibility around sound. However, her internal conflict remains relatively low-friction—she moves steadily toward her goal without much contradictory impulse or moral tension. The ending shift feels earned but not deeply contested, limiting the emotional cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s profession, history, and blind spot are clearly drawn, and his central decision—to subsume rather than sell—feels motivated by the tension between professional ethics and his deeper hunger for empathy. Interiority is specific (static on skin, tears on dust-streaked cheeks) rather than purely labeled. The internal contradiction between “dealer in counterfeit emotions” and someone who longs to understand without drowning is well dramatized. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing (“integrate its lesson,” “professional ethics”) keeps this just short of utterly lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent, and his occupational lens (broker/logistics) colors his emotional shift nicely. The relationship with Liam is sketched quickly but credibly, with a clear shared mission. However, internal conflict is minimal—Elias moves smoothly from observation to altruism with little hesitation or cost. The arc feels more like confirmation of existing goodness than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing for connection and her reed-work give her a clear, specific motivation, and Kael’s decades of searching add depth and pathos. The moment she offers “partnership, not pity” is a strong, character-revealing choice. However, the piece softens real contradiction and flaw—both characters are almost purely noble, with little friction or self-sabotage. Some emotions are labeled rather than dramatized (“bold sympathy,” “luminescent ache”), which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular (lifelong quest plus the recovered lullaby), and her professional precision neatly informs how she manipulates time. However, she faces little on-page resistance or internal contradiction, so her success feels almost entirely assured once her ability is introduced. Emotional embodiment appears in moments like the tears at the echo burst, but we rarely see competing impulses (fear vs. desire, doubt vs. drive) complicate her choices. The final “mending the world’s soul” realization is conceptually earned but not strongly contested in her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in a long-standing, eccentric goal that fits her conjurer identity and the orchard’s numinous setting. Her emotions are mostly embodied through tactile ritual—the glass eyes, the chipped stone, the remembered feel of sap—and her final reconfiguration of grief feels earned by what she experiences. The main limitation is that we see little active resistance or contradiction in her at the moment of revelation; she moves from question to acceptance with almost no friction. A touch more visible struggle or clinging to the old framework in the vision beat would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and history are clear and particular, and her small but significant actions (retrieving the cache, placing the fragment, choosing to step out) all align with that drive. The sense-memory of her father is vivid and grounds her interiority. However, her inner conflict is relatively smooth—there’s limited dramatized tug-of-war between her desire for invisibility and her wish to be seen, which slightly softens the impact of her final choice. Evans, while affecting, functions more as a mirror than an active crucible for Elara’s contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s controlling flaw and conflicted love for her plants are sharply drawn, and her shift from “commander to companion” is convincingly motivated by the linden leaf and past storms. Interiority is specific and embodied (boots sinking, soil on her cheek), and her renunciation of frantic reconstruction reads as a real cost to her identity. The internal contradiction—trust in nature vs. compulsive control—is active throughout. A slight safety net is that the change comes smoothly, without much visible backsliding or resistance in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s insomnia, artistic compulsion, and sense of custodial duty are clear and consistent, and his final surrender of the brooch feels like a credible evolution rather than a contrived beat. The micro-choice to follow the rain trails is quiet but well-motivated by his long vigil and “thresh meaning” impulse. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“profound exhaustion…not hollow fatigue”), though internal contradiction under pressure is relatively understated—he gives up the brooch with very little resistance. The relationship with Elara is efficient but carries real weight as a legacy handoff, not just exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and arc are clear and specific—her shift from anxious control to surrendered faith feels earned and rooted in her history of reliable visions. Her interiority is mostly concrete (the anxiety at her blindness, the tactile warmth of the pearl) and tied to micro-choices at the ritual threshold. The pilgrim is thinly characterized and functions mainly as a catalyst/foil, which limits relational pressure. Some emotional beats are summarized in abstract terms rather than embodied, but the core change lands.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: she restores the valve, chooses how to use it, and deliberately structures her “intervals” of truth. Her embodied responses (the vision, the gasp, the warmth in her chest) are concrete and character-particular. However, her internal conflict stays relatively smooth—she bears a “gift and burden,” but we rarely see that burden drive mistakes or genuine contradiction in her actions. Elder Lin functions more as a validating chorus than a source of pressure, so relational tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—fifteen years of precision and desperation aimed at the “fortress of unspoken truths”—and the surrender of her map is a credible high-stakes choice. Internal contradiction is present (violent tremor vs “trembling certainty”), and her traits (meticulous, analytic-artistic) manifest in concrete perceptions and choices. The change from avoidance to self-acceptance is earned by prior setup but lands a bit tidily, with some abstracted, therapy-adjacent phrasing (“emotional avoidance,” “self-acceptance”) softening the messiness of such a shift. Still, her interiority feels individual rather than generic, with the emotional map as an especially strong character-specific artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s mix of skepticism and compassion is clear, consistent, and directly motivates every key choice, especially risking engagement with the tile for Liam’s sake. Her interiority is particular and embodied (cataloging absurdities while remembering her mentor), and her shift at the end—from dismissing lore to honoring connection—is earned. The main limitation is that her flaws never exact a sharp on-page cost; her skepticism “bows” rather smoothly rather than causing a real mistake or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s core motivation (eroding boredom and the need to know what comes after goodbye) is clear and consistent, and his emotional shift at the end feels grounded in what we’ve seen. However, his inner life is relatively smooth—there’s little felt contradiction or real hesitation when facing the spatial tear, which softens the sense of struggle. His immortality and dimensional awareness are more stated traits than sources of on-page mistakes or blind spots. The final transformation into “keeper of the threshold” is credible but comes a bit quickly, with limited micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to escape her father’s legacy without betraying coerced participants—is clear, specific, and governs every choice. Her interiority is grounded in concrete objects (ink pot, legal pad, her father’s body) and a credible tension between filial complexity and ethical revulsion. Internal change from trapped heir to self-defined actor feels earned by the incremental “waiting actively” process. The main limitation is that her contradictions (love/resentment, fear/ambition) are more articulated than dramatized under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined and enacted—her devotion to “textures of different times” and the ritual with the lamp read as deeply character-specific. Interiority is filtered through sensate, disciplined attention rather than generic emotion labels. However, internal conflict is minimal; her stance never really wavers, so the arc is more confirmation than test. The final endurance (continuing her practice) is earned but carries only a soft, conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s erased identity and hunger for the “texture of memories” create a distinctive, coherent psychology, and his actions (collecting, layering, archiving) align tightly with that motive. Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than generic, especially in the Aris Thorne passage. Internal contradiction (hollow self vs. meaningful purpose) is present but relatively stable rather than dynamically pressured into a concrete choice. The ending confirms an Earned Stasis of vocation more than a newly crystallized conflict, which keeps this strong but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction (professional debunker vs granddaughter seeking a quasi-mystical answer) are cleanly established and pay off in her final reframing of “myth.” Her interiority is concrete and specific—shell in her palm, remembered tobacco, the cello hum—as she works through grief and skepticism. The emotional turn from puzzle-solving to accepting a tender, transient truth feels earned by the on-page process of listening and retelling. The only limitation is that her struggle never quite gets messy or self-sabotaging; she adapts smoothly, which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s internal conflict between loyalty to the Guild and pragmatic acceptance of OmniCorp is specific, credible, and consistently driving his choices, especially in his decision to build “invisible bridges of memory, not barricades of protest.” His orderly-intuitive nature is shown through how he designs the graffiti network, not merely told. The main weakness is that his emotional life under pressure leans a bit abstract and mission-stated (“His motivation was clear…”) rather than fully embodied in messy, contradictory feelings in the peak beats. Relationships remain mostly offstage (no elders, no corporate figures in scene), so his conflict never quite sharpens in a live interpersonal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive—honoring his grandfather by securing a “last dawn” photograph—is specific, embodied, and consistent, and his grief is carried in concrete details like the sand grain and the hourglass memory. Interiority is vivid and felt, especially in the “outlasted” litany and the final descent. However, internal conflict is relatively one-note: he never seriously wavers or reveals contradictory impulses about staying, leaving, or resisting the mining, so the emotional arc leans more on endurance than on a charged inner dilemma. The final stance—quiet acceptance with ache—is credible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply drawn as a competent, devout artisan whose blindness and tactile intelligence shape every choice, and her motivation to restore the drone as “sacred duty” is clear and consistent. However, she is almost entirely serene and self-possessed; we get little genuine internal contradiction or emotional strain under time pressure. Her choices are mostly expressions of established virtue rather than moments that test or complicate her values. The endurance of her calm functions as an arc, but the felt cost of that stance is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and specific: a dry-witted atlas editor whose rebellious fixation on “origins, not symptoms” coherently drives every choice. Her interiority is textured with memory (publishers, phantom tributaries) and embodied perception (vibration in the glass), but internal conflict is muted—she rarely feels truly torn or under pressure. The shift from “worrying tranquility” to clarity is earned but comes without much struggle, reading more as confirmation than transformation. This keeps her strong, memorable, but just shy of deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and defining trait—quiet, infinite patience in service of communal balance—are clearly dramatized and govern her choices. However, she remains largely an emblematic figure rather than a psychologically contradictory person; we don’t see much internal friction or competing impulses under pressure. Her actions align coherently with her stated purpose and attribute, and the cost (subsuming her own rhythm into the town) is legible but understated. The piece privileges archetypal function over granular, individuated interiority, which trims the ceiling at this word-count.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motivation (redemption via preserving the builders’ last serene memory, anchored in Elena) is clear and specific, and his internal conflict—panic vs meditative patience—is credibly dramatized in the oxygen-countdown beats. His micro-choices (“consciously overriding the instinct to rush”) reveal a coherent value hierarchy. The Elena memory is efficient but a bit archetypal, and we get only a narrow slice of his flaws beyond guilt and desperation. Still, the final endurance/renunciation (accepting death to secure the vial) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to have his long-dismissed truth finally witnessed and to escape his father’s legacy—is clear, specific, and consistent, and his quiet, methodical tactics (bringing the lattice, inviting Elias to look) align with that. The relationship with Elias yields a real shift in status and trust, capped by “We do this together.” However, Kael is rendered almost entirely as morally steady and self-possessed; we get little embodied contradiction or real struggle on the page, so the inner conflict feels somewhat underpowered. Elias’s turn, while moving, is rapid and lightly dramatized in terms of his prior complicity or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ghost bride’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her “mournful elation” provides a credible emotional through-line. However, her internal conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices—she never seriously wavers or risks choosing herself over the debt. Elias is more emblem than character, which limits relational complexity. The final dissolution is earned but emotionally could cut deeper if her contradictory impulses surfaced more in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent—her drive to mend “broken precedents” and reconnect the canyon’s sacred heart is clear and enacted through her sewing ritual. Interiority is concrete (calloused fingers, tears in the dust) but skewed toward saintly, unconflicted reverence; she rarely feels morally or emotionally torn. The main internal tension (grief for loss vs. hope for renewal) is named and gestured at, yet never forces a costly or compromising choice. As a result, she’s compelling and particular but lacks the sharper contradictions and visible flaws that would lift this to top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s longing to restore her family’s faith is concrete, embodied in small acts like each “scoop of soil” as apology, and her final decision to stay and tend the orchard feels causally earned. Her inner state is rendered through sensory attention rather than labels, and her actions (accepting the elder’s charge, crafting the gnomon) align with that motivation. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper contradiction under pressure—her doubt is named but not strongly dramatized as an opposing impulse at key beats. The arc from exile to recommitment is persuasive but emotionally too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation, values, and habits are clearly and consistently drawn, and her micro-choices (rejecting “Lyra” and “Corbin,” kneeling to decipher chalk, choosing “Aurora”) all align with her stated drive to find “meaning in the margins.” The emotional shift from tension/uncertainty to a lighter, quieter satisfaction is credible if modest. What’s missing at a higher level is deeper contradiction or sharper internal conflict—she rarely feels genuinely torn beyond aesthetic calibration. The result is a strong but relatively safe characterization arc.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and competencies are clear and specific—her role as galaxy-chart embroiderer and listener to “unheard stories” feels particular, and her decision to act through Idris is well-motivated. However, her interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with “cold dread” and resolve stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her flaw/strategy—disguising wisdom as foolishness—has some cost (being dismissed, moving unseen) but is never put under real strain. The ending reflects endurance of her existing stance more than a freshly earned internal shift, though it is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s regret, pride, and fear of vulnerability are concretely dramatized, especially in the hinge scene where he watches his younger self hesitate with the letter. His change—moving from carrying regret to accepting forgiveness—feels earned by what he sees and understands. Elara is somewhat archetypal but gains specificity through her tactile relationship to the shard and her “fierce yet tender” guidance. The relationship dynamic is a clear crucible that pushes him toward a costly emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Anahera is sharply realized: the Pacific conflict-zone interpreter whose trauma history specifically informs how she reads Leo’s cast is vivid and convincing. Her motivation—to “graft new meaning onto old wounds”—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (staying, touching the coral, decoding each symbol, speaking to Leo). The internal contradiction between armored silence and a renewed willingness to feel is clear, especially around the remembered Tok Pisin boy. The only limitation is that her struggle feels relatively smooth; there’s little on-page resistance or self-sabotage as she moves toward her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—rediscovering a specific, inherited joy—is clear and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. Her emotional responses to the fragment and the resurrected fresco feel particular rather than generic. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or real struggle in scene; her arc moves smoothly from ache to fulfillment with limited friction. The final realization is emotionally credible but almost too tidy, lacking a sharply felt cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her craft—the way she handles cracked plaster, tools, and the nickel feels lived-in and character-particular. Her initial drive for scholarly certainty versus the later embrace of curiosity forms a clear internal contradiction that resolves in a meaningful choice. The “third awakening” explicitly frames this shift and mostly earns it through prior beats, though the realization lands a bit tidily. Emotional embodiment could be slightly more textured under pressure; her struggle is more articulated than truly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motivation and interior stakes are clear and personalized (the psychic audit, his “spark of defiance”), and his scholarly/roguish traits convincingly drive his tactics. Petrova and the other figures function well as pressure and chorus without stealing focus. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or visibly costly choice; he is resolved from the outset, and that stance doesn’t get meaningfully tested. The final “cartographer of hope” turn feels earned but emotionally smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—insomnia, longing, and the vow to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” feel deeply rooted in his nature. His shy persistence over centuries credibly earns the final peace. What holds this short of top-tier is the relative lack of in-scene contradictory impulses under pressure; most of the piece affirms a single, beautifully rendered orientation rather than dramatizing live inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her actions consistently flow from her devotion to preserving forgotten names. However, she experiences almost no contradictory impulses or real internal conflict; she is serene and assured from start to finish. The tear and her reverence for the crack hint at depth, but the piece stops short of dramatizing any struggle between duty, fatigue, doubt, or desire for something beyond her role. The final stance feels more affirmed than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity feel specific and lived-in, and her 97 days of silence give credible weight to her urgency. Her “careful recklessness” is shown through bold interpretive leaps paired with meticulous documentation, not just told. The relationship with Kael functions as a clear crucible, with her admission of fault and offering of the translation as a concrete reconciliation move. Internal contradiction (guilt vs drive, fear vs daring) is present but could be dramatized with a few more in-the-moment frictions rather than mostly inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in his craft and family legacy, and his actions consistently align with that drive. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized (“sacred tightrope,” “dappled resolve”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in-scene, so his final peace feels a touch too frictionless. Elara and Borin function as stakes-markers more than fully pressured relationships, though their twenty-year rift nods toward richer dynamics. The ending does show a credible, if gentle, change: Kael chooses bridge-building over allegiance, but the personal cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his conflicting impulses—self-protective erasure vs. fidelity to Lyra and Starlight—dramatized rather than merely labeled. The meteorite balancing ritual, his reaction to the dust vortex, and the decision to write truth in the ledger all reveal a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. The final choice to show the ledger to Clara is credibly earned by earlier beats and carries visible emotional cost. A minor limitation is occasional abstraction (“reinventing his personal history”) where more embodied micro-behavior could deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief, curiosity, and quiet tenacity are clearly motivated and anchored in concrete habits (wood-grain reading, carrying the logbook). The emotional throughline from ache to acceptance is convincing, but internal conflict (e.g., resentment vs. reverence toward her mother) is more implied than actively dramatized in the moment. Her final shift feels earned by prior beats, though the cost of letting go is primarily stated rather than pressed on through a hard choice. Overall she reads specific and consistent, if a touch tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to learn “the rhythm of belonging”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her practice, and her final act of releasing the feather is a credible, costful renunciation of an old identity. Interiority is concrete and particular (the burnt feather, the remembered hillside, the feel of cool air after weeks underwater). The inner conflict between solitude and connection is understated but present, resolved through an earned shift rather than a flip. A slight softness is that her realization comes very smoothly; there are few moments where her blind spots or flaws actively complicate choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and inner texture (“cheerful gloom”) are vivid and consistent, and her curiosity-driven, almost scientific temperament feels specific. Her actions—testing the glass, planting seeds, refining her conjecture—track cleanly with that motive. Internal contradiction (hope vs. sorrow, capture vs. release) is present and integrated rather than merely stated. The limitation is that her struggle never bites very hard; we rarely see her pay a real emotional or moral price for her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Corbin’s motivation as an analytical, quietly rebellious street performer is clear and specific, and his choices (calculating the arch, sacrificing the bishop, waiting in shadow) all align with that core. The elderly man is sketched economically but lands as a distinct presence whose reaction meaningfully reconfigures Corbin’s internal state. What’s missing for top-tier characterization is real contradiction or cost within Corbin—his competence is never seriously tested, and there’s little sense of risk or internal conflict as he executes his plan. The final validation feels earned but relatively low-stakes emotionally for him.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and history are vivid and specific, and Kael’s fear-into-resolve arc is clear, but internal contradiction under pressure is light—both largely perform their roles without much on-page ambivalence. The exile choice and three-year anchoring give Elara a credible throughline to the final release. However, Kael remains more emblematic than individuated, and the relationship dynamic is tender but not deeply stressed. The final shift—Elara’s spirit beginning “to fledge from the weight of exile”—is earned but a touch summarized rather than felt through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is distinct and well-motivated, with the glazier’s eye and quiet rebellion against the mundane giving her interiority specificity. However, she encounters almost no genuine resistance; her “reckoning” feels like confirmation of an existing disposition more than a pressured, contradictory choice. The shift from seeing cracks as flaws to stories is graceful but low-cost. Emotional embodiment is present but tends to stay in the same contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific—his scars, professional history, and vow from Cedar Ridge cohere into a clear, persistent motivation. His arc from burdened carrier of the box to “keeper of embers” is credible and rooted in prior beats. The main limitation is a slight drift into abstract/therapeutic phrasing (“translate searing personal pain into a universal language”) that flattens some of his messier contradictions. Still, his final stance feels earned and carries a recognizable cost: living publicly with his scars as language.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and method are clear, consistent, and particular (“cartographer of possibility,” “equations for hope”), and her choices structurally drive the story. However, she remains almost entirely competent and serene; we don’t see contradictory impulses or real emotional strain under pressure. The gardener-of-multiverse frame at the end is thematically apt but softens any sense of cost or limitation. This keeps her from feeling as psychologically deep as the world she inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, sensibility, and obsession are clear and consistent, and the curiosity-to-covenant shift is legible and motivated. However, her interiority leans abstract (“legacy’s burden,” “soul heavy”) and rarely shows live, contradictory impulses under pressure. We see reverence and solemn duty but not much friction between competing values or desires. The final commitment is earned but a bit told rather than felt through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s motivation is clear and specific—using a borrowed heartbeat to coax the mirrors toward possibility—and his actions consistently serve that aim. Interiority is mostly implied through his “perceptively calm” demeanor and physical strain rather than deep contradictory impulses. The weakening heartbeat provides some embodied emotion and cost, especially at “a wave of dizziness passed through him,” but his serenity blunts internal conflict. This yields a compelling figure, but not yet the kind of layered, self-opposed character elite venues often demand.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation (redemption through securing peace and then resigning) is specific, consistent, and drives his choices, especially in the confession and self-removal. His "operatively gentle" manner is dramatized in his responses to the elder and the scoffing delegate. Internal conflict between guilt and duty surfaces credibly without melodrama. The change at the end—walking away from his post—feels earned and visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silas’s characterization is rich and internally contradictory: ruthless architect of the drought yet painstakingly tender with the egg, disdainful of redemption yet driven to this quasi-religious ritual. His past with the river, public persona, and private guilt all feed directly into his on-page choices. The kneeling, the precision of aligning the egg, and the decision not to look back are all motivated and costly. The final re-armoring of the “philanthropist’s mask” feels fully earned by the inner fissure shown throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim erased voices and defy enforced conformity—is clear, specific, and coherently expressed through her actions in the ritual. The "chaste courtesan" contradiction is intriguing and thematically charged, and her thoughts of her sisters in the Spire sharpen her moral stance. However, internal conflict is muted; she rarely feels genuinely torn or afraid, so the peak choice reads as determined rather than pressured. The endurance and dedication at the end feel earned, but the cost to her remains more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motives and arc are clear and specific: from self-styled subversive puppeteer to surrendered witness, driven by an ethical obsession that feels rooted in his temperament and craft. His flaw (controlling the narrative while believing he’s radical) is cleanly dramatized via Lena’s critique and his reaction to the story stick. The internal shift is credible and culminates in a concrete renunciation (removing the puppet stage) with a discernible cost to his ego and artistic identity. What’s missing at this tier is more embodied contradiction under pressure; the piece relies heavily on reflective insight rather than conflicted in-the-moment behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular (esoteric realist, vow to overlooked histories), and her tenderness with the moth wing / monarch feels earned and embodied. Her micro-choices under pressure (not moving as the monarch arrives; untying the central knot; choosing care over the original signal purpose) all align coherently with that core value set. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal contradiction or visible struggle—she is almost always serenely in the right, so the “cost” to her is gentle rather than truly conflicted. The final change reads as deepening of an existing stance rather than a pressured, ambiguous turn.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to atone for the bell disaster by preserving forgotten names—is clear, consistent, and integrated with her craft identity as a lost wax caster. Her interiority is specific (e.g., “forgiving herself for the shattered bell casting that erased her village’s last audible names”) and embodied through ritual action and tears. However, most of the true conflict around guilt and forgiveness occurs off-page before the story begins, so we see more resolution than struggle. The final redefinition of herself as a “keeper of echoes” feels earned but not hard-won in-scene, which keeps this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and constraint (foresight/hindsight without present) are clear, character-specific, and pay off in her transformed perception at the end. Her inner life is mostly rendered via image rather than deep contradictory impulses, so the struggle toward transcendence feels relatively smooth and low-friction. The decision to break the seal is believable and grounded in the storm/humidity pressure. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal resistance or cost as she crosses that threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Enlil’s motivation and traits (frugality, rigor, devotion) are clear and consistently expressed through concrete habits like measuring lamp oil and tracing diagrams, and his final inner shift from lonely seeker to “covenant participant” is earned by prior setup. However, internal conflict is relatively muted—his skepticism and yearning don’t clash on the page so much as align smoothly—so we don’t see him genuinely torn or making a visibly costly trade-off in scene. The emotional experience remains mostly reverent and serene, even at peak beats, which limits depth. Still, he reads as particular and non-generic, and his closure stance is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara and Kael both have clear, specific motivations, and Kael’s internal change from guarded resentment to release is well earned through concrete sensory recall (“His bones remembered the safety of his mother’s lap...”). The “scheming pacifist” angle gives Elara distinctiveness, though her own internal conflict and cost are underplayed compared to Kael’s. Emotions are mostly embodied rather than labeled, though terms like “resentment” and “corrosive grip” lean toward abstraction. The final renunciation of resentment feels credible and forecloses a real prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and craft-based worldview are clear and consistent, and her gentleness with the glass gives her a distinct moral texture. However, there’s very little internal contradiction or felt risk—she never seems genuinely torn or under emotional pressure, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. The “mending a fragment of a broken soul” beat hints at deeper stakes but isn’t strongly prefigured in her inner life. More visible doubt, fear of failure, or conflicting impulses in the ritual would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and profession are clear, and her micro-choices with the tools and ribbon align convincingly with her desire to reconcile old and new. The relationship with Lyra has real tenderness, and the ribbon memory is well used to expose vulnerability. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped: Elara moves from resistance to conceptual clarity with little felt struggle, which softens the cost of change. The reconciliation, while moving, resolves very cleanly without much ambivalence or residual fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—pursuing forbidden knowledge despite her oath—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice on the page. Her bewilderment, frustration, and eventual calm are embodied in concrete actions (trembling hands, going to the bathroom, kneeling at the tree) rather than abstract labels. The internal contradiction between her role as curator-steward and her desire to break the guild’s statutes is present but resolved rather smoothly, with relatively little felt cost or moral abrasion. This slightly softens the sense of deeply contested internal conflict that an elite piece might push harder.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained, and her internal conflict—competence versus the fear she’s not enough—credibly shapes her pivotal choice to voice that fear. Her “arcane linguist” lens inflects perception and tactics rather than sitting as a label. The relationship with Kael is efficient but functional, with his fragility and desperation pressing her into bolder action. The closing shift from seeker to “tending gardens of unlearned lessons” feels earned by prior beats rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motivation and internal fracture are sharply rendered, and her final renunciation of the card is convincingly earned from the accumulated grief and altered memories. The chimera twin bond and her “blissfully aberrant” tenderness toward decay feel specific rather than generic quirk. The main weakness is that her insight near the end edges into essayistic clarity (“Recapture was not retrieval; it was reverence.”), slightly smoothing over what could remain more conflicted. Still, her emotional throughline has real complexity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is specific, competent, and motivated; her archivist mindset and calm, tactile engagement with artifacts feel lived-in and consistent. Her desire “to translate confusion into clarity” plausibly drives every action, especially the rope reconfiguration. However, she faces little internal contradiction or emotional friction—the story rarely pressures her values or creates genuine doubt—so her final state feels more like confirmation than costly change. The arc is satisfying but emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his professional identity as mapkeeper nicely inflects his choices, especially in the ice-reading sequence. However, his interiority leans more toward lofty abstraction than contradiction under pressure, so we rarely see competing impulses or genuine doubt. The emotional movement from grief-stricken duty to “hammered repose” is persuasive but relatively linear. A bit more friction or self-misgiving in the ritual beat would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—thirty years of meticulous star-tracking to prove the alignment’s meaning gives her a credible, obsessive drive. Her emotional life is embodied (the hum as companion, tears cutting through dust), and her micro-choices at the climax are cleanly motivated. What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or real doubt on the page; she never seriously wavers, so her shift is confirmation rather than a complex reconfiguration. The social cost (ostracism by survivor camps) is stated rather than dramatized, which slightly softens the felt price of her devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to sculpt identity from experience and to keep the collective memory alive—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her role as archivist. Her “preemptive nostalgia” is particular and embodied, shifting credibly into resolve as she realizes the fog may be a new canvas. Internal conflict between anticipatory grief and the urge to shape meaning is present throughout rather than appearing only at the end. The only minor weakness is a touch of telling in lines like “Her motivation was never mere record-keeping,” which slightly flattens what the scene already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory focus, and steady motivation are vivid and particular, and her choices (seeking the fortress, using the knot, adopting the new design as a vow) coherently express who she is. Her emotional life comes through more in textured perception than in explicit feeling, which works for the mode. The main limitation is a lack of visible internal contradiction or real moral friction—she’s almost entirely composed of purpose and sensitivity, which slightly flattens her complexity. The final shift from burdened to purposeful is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is specific and coherent—her observational, tidal-pool-trained mindset clearly drives her tactics, and Kael’s guardedness plus the single tear give him a felt interiority despite limited page time. Motivation is consistent (she wants understanding, not victory), and her final choice to invoke shared childhood is credibly earned. Internal contradiction is mild—she’s almost unwaveringly wise and patient, which slightly flattens complexity. The relationship shift is believable and emotionally grounded but a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s core contradiction—crippling claustrophobia driving a deliberate quest for dangerous, transformative silences—is vivid and consistently dramatized. Her actions (choosing the sky-trellis, closing her eyes, releasing and then re-cradling the doll) align cleanly with that motive. The father’s legacy operates as a palpable pressure rather than exposition, and the final reframing of herself as “the bunker builder’s claustrophobic child” feels earned. Some lines tilt toward abstracted self-knowledge (“By limiting exposure to terror, she had cultivated inner space”), which slightly flattens the otherwise embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara and Leo are cleanly sketched with clear, consistent motives—her as a practiced guide of silence, him as a child clinging to noise as defense against grief. Leo’s shift from rigid resistance to “weary peace” is motivated by specific beats (storm glass, listening lesson, grandmother), though the internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly for the depth of his loss. Interiority is more often narrated than embodied, with some emotion labels (“grief-shadowed,” “anguish”) standing in for messier contradiction. Still, the final renunciation—accepting silence as linked to his grandmother—feels earned and carries believable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, rooted in vocation and reverence, and her micro-choices (leaving the archives, how she peels, refusing the staircase) align with that. The archivist sensibility comes through in how she reads and handles history, not just in labels. However, her internal conflict at the climactic moment—turning away from the stairway—is accepted almost instantly, with little on-page turmoil or contradiction. That keeps the final renunciation from feeling as hard-won or costly as it could at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation—protecting her hard-won solitude while responding to another’s suffocation—is specific and consistent, and her final refusal to open the door feels earned by the careful bridge-burning history. The internal drive “to teach suffocating things how to breathe” manifests concretely through the breathing ritual, not just as a tag. However, she edges toward being a bit too purely wise and self-possessed; there’s limited real contradiction or messy irrationality under pressure. A touch more visible ambivalence or self-deception at the peak would deepen her beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—turning the pressure and shame of the pyramid scheme into meaning—with the bolt and her volunteering choice embodying that drive. Her interiority is mostly shown through concrete anchors (the bolt, the farm, the texts), though moments like “her deepest motivation was no longer escape, but alchemy” lean toward label instead of dramatized contradiction. The pivotal choice to sacrifice the bolt and then secretly bury the diamond feels earned by what we’ve seen of her. Internal conflict could surface more as live tension in the Heartroot scene rather than being largely pre-resolved into resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—clarifying her role as “dynasty ender” and uncovering the truth—is precise, consistent, and flows cleanly into each micro-choice (submitting to the method, following the dust bands, accepting the letter’s message). Her interiority is specific and embodied (the crank in her palm, the tear cutting through dust) rather than abstract. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses under pressure are only lightly sketched; her shift from ache to acceptance is smooth and could benefit from a sharper, more dramatized moment of resistance or doubt. Still, the final renunciation of inherited guilt feels earned and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation and arc from withdrawn knight to threshold guardian are clear and moving, with the oath and the marionette creating a coherent throughline. However, his internal conflict is relatively soft: once the ritual begins, there’s little sense of genuine risk or contradictory impulse around opening the clasp. Emotional states are often named in elevated language rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. The final transformation feels earned but not hard-won, which dulls the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and coherent—her status as recently emancipated and “broken-hearted” cleanly motivates her return to the archive and her tenderness toward the artifacts. However, her emotional journey skews tidy: sorrow “softens” and begins “mending” with minimal on-page friction or contradiction under pressure. The lack of a true internal clash (e.g., resentment vs. reverence, or suspicion vs. hope) keeps the arc from feeling fully earned. Still, her micro-choices (how she handles the envelope, how she annotates the file) align convincingly with her stated motives.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivations (guarding erased histories rather than seeking vengeance) are clear and consistent with her archivist background, and her choices drive every beat. However, her interiority stays mostly in elevated summary (“quiet, fierce vow,” “unshakable peace”) rather than embodied, scene-specific ambivalence. We don’t feel much contradictory pull between fear and conviction at the climax; she is almost too composed. The earned-stasis ending works, but the emotional cost could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation (mercy, protecting the valley) is clear and consistent, and his relationship to his grandfather gives him a distinct emotional texture. Interiority is concrete and embodied (tears, ritual gestures), and his tactics follow logically from his beliefs about silence. The internal conflict—dread versus duty, fear of prophecy versus love of place—is present but relatively low-key, so his final endurance costs him mainly in quiet burden rather than a sharpened dilemma. That keeps the arc from fully peaking at the level of deep contradiction a top-tier piece might reach.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and specific, and her reverent, methodical nature comes through in concrete actions (sorting, building monuments, handling the leaf). However, she is drawn almost entirely in one register—serene, devoted, quietly joyful—with little on-page contradiction or real internal struggle. The “transformation” she undergoes feels more like a reaffirmation than a costly shift. This limits the depth and bite of her characterization for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (accepting the job to “befriend uncertainty in planning”) is clear and coherently tracked through her choices, especially in not forcing the seized needle. We get embodied, particular details (oil-stained hands, improvising with a curtain rod) that ground her. The internal conflict—rigid control versus surrender—is present but leans a bit on stated realizations rather than being fully dramatized in competing impulses on the page. The final shift feels earned, though the emotional cost of that shift could be textured more ambivalently.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—transforming guilt over Kael into understanding—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete ritual choices. Her emotional journey from crushing shame to a tempered, humbler equilibrium feels earned by the scene’s progression. However, her interiority is often stated in abstract thematic language (“equilibrium,” “luminous regret”) rather than dramatized with more particular, character-specific contradiction, which slightly flattens complexity. The relationship with Kael is strongly present but entirely off-page, limiting the felt texture of that bond.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and motivation are clearly and consistently rendered, and Cora’s regret-to-laughter shift reads emotionally credible. The modestly fearless trait is shown through her unflinching listening and playful risk with humor rather than only told. However, Elara faces little real internal contradiction or struggle on the page; she operates as an almost perfectly calibrated healer. The final “bittersweet weight” is earned but relatively low-cost, keeping the character work strong rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s inner life is vivid and particular, with his “enhanced interrogation survivor” background plausibly driving his obsession with mercy-as-math. The embodied details of proprioception and trauma responses give his reactions specificity rather than generic suffering. Internal conflict between ghost-like displacement and purposeful rootedness is stated clearly, though often explained rather than dramatized in relational friction. The main limitation is that his epiphanies come slightly pre-packaged, with relatively little messy contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently enacted, and the memories of Hemlock (rope knot, sparrow, constellation) give her interiority texture rather than generic grief. However, she encounters little real resistance, and there’s limited contradictory impulse on the page—she never seriously wavers, which keeps her arc more affirmational than conflicted. The relationship with Hemlock is affecting but idealized, with minimal moral or emotional messiness. Cora functions more as a witness than as active pressure, so relational crucible dynamics are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—compulsive curiosity about hidden spaces, professional competence, and deep compassion for ghosts. His micro-choices (waiting out the light, using the ladder, choosing to take on the vow to find Clara) all align with those traits. However, internal conflict is minimal; he rarely seems torn or strained, so the emotional cost of his choice is more implied than felt. The ghost reads more as a function of pathos than a fully pressured character, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—compressing eternity into an instant—and her competence is well-drawn through specific craft details, like reading frost patterns and operating the press. However, her interiority remains mostly declarative and idealized (“quiet certainty,” “knew her work carried”), with limited contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The danger to the library is intellectually acknowledged but not deeply felt through her body or irrational fears. As a result, the final acceptance of cost and outcome feels earned but emotionally muted rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in her history with Kaelen, and her actions under pressure (covering mirrors, devising the projection) arise credibly from that devotion. Her emotional life is embodied through specific perceptions of time-filaments and the shard, giving her a distinct interior texture. However, her internal conflict is comparatively mild—there’s little simultaneous pull between doubt and faith, so her arc feels more like confirmation than transformation. Valerius functions effectively as a foil but remains thin, with his reversal landing a bit too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s characterization is vivid and specific: the “music box repairman” as quasi-priest, his scarred hands, the covenant of rust, and his physiological reaction to dishonesty all cohere into a distinct person. Motivation (reclaiming the stolen light) is clear and consistently tied to his traits and vocation. The wilt during the tether-forging nicely externalizes his internal limit under pressure. What’s missing, for the very top tier, is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or moral ambiguity—his path feels right but not meaningfully contested from within.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, particular, and consistent, and her micro-choices (entering, using psychometry, refusing to take a sample, returning the compass) all track with her sensibly eccentric, reverent disposition. The interiority is concrete and embodied (“tears tracing clean paths through the dust”), and her shift from collecting to surrendering feels earned by what she experiences. Internal conflict is present but subdued: she must relinquish her professional impulse to catalogue in favor of awe. The cost of that renunciation could be pushed slightly harder on the page to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and specific—her craft, ancestry, and worldview are all vividly embedded in her perceptions and choices. Motivation is clear (reframing the GPS failure through ancestral guidance), and micro-choices like carving without sketches credibly reveal her values. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper contradiction or a more hazardous flaw; her internal struggle is more gentle reframing than true conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and emotional life are clear, particular, and embodied (pigment-dusted hands, shawl whispering against stone, tears tracing silent paths). Her drive is credibly rooted in her relationship with her grandmother and the night-blooming flowers, and her final shift in understanding feels earned by the scene with the glass. What’s missing at a truly top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or a felt struggle against competing impulses—the realization arrives smoothly rather than through contested inner terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent: a meticulous archivist driven to reconcile a historical contradiction, and his emotional arc from anxiety to exhausted relief lands. The retrocognitive agony, his trembling reverence with the stones, and his tears on return give embodied feeling rather than label-only states. Internal conflict is present but relatively soft—he never seriously wavers in his goal, and there’s limited contradiction between competing impulses in the peak beat. The final stance (to publish and reframe the record) feels earned, though its personal cost is more implied than explored.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—her refusal to chase the return of magic aligns with her choice to design greenhouses and libraries instead. Interiority is concrete and textured (“working memory unlocked sensory threads”), showing a mind organized around craft and memory. However, internal conflict is underplayed: the text tells us she has rejected nostalgia and false comfort rather than dramatizing moments where those impulses tug at her, so her final stance feels somewhat pre-decided. The change at the end is more a crystallization than a hard-won reversal, which slightly reduces felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s vocation, sensibility, and lifelong obsession with emotional acoustics are sharply drawn and feel particular rather than generic. Her core motivation—to archive emotional patterns—credibly evolves into a new purpose of cultivation when the “accidental prophecy” clarifies the meaning of the silence. The internal shift is earned through concrete triggers (the warming shaving, Hemlock’s words, the silent apple). The main limitation is that her fear, reluctance, or grief at relinquishing her old role remains underexplored, so the cost of change stays mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to experience the “texture of borrowed time”—is clear, consistent, and coherently drives every choice in the ritual. Her interiority is rendered through concrete perception (seeds, ice, warmth) rather than labels, and her “furiously tranquil” focus feels particular rather than generic calm. What’s missing at a top-tier level is genuine internal contradiction or cost; she never meaningfully wavers, doubts, or risks failure. The final stance shift (seeing the garden as cradle, not tomb) is earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and professional mindset are sharply drawn, with concrete habits (frost-feather angles, ibex as barometer) grounding her identity as a careful observer. Her core value—listening over noise—credibly drives the final refusal to ring the bell. Internal contradiction is present but soft: by zero hour she seems largely resolved, so we don’t see much live fear of being wrong in the decisive moment. Still, the endurance of her stance over decades and its eventual institutionalization read earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is clear, particular, and consistent—his spiritually curious, reverent attention to dust, stars, and stillness feels genuinely his. His motivation “to find strength in vulnerability” is dramatized via the meteor communion and his altered relationship to sweeping. However, his arc moves smoothly toward insight with little on-page contradiction or resistance, so the final realization risks feeling slightly pre-packaged rather than wrestled for. Emotional embodiment is solid but sometimes yields to abstract labeling (“vulnerability,” “resilience”) instead of messier, more conflicted feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The recluse’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his ritual with the box tracks well with his stated purpose. However, his interior life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, so we don’t feel much real-time tension or contradiction in him. The shift from “astonishment” to “quiet joy” lands, but it comes with little on-page struggle or ambivalence. Elias and Anya’s relationship is affecting but largely conveyed in exposition rather than in pressured present-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motives (debt to the Guild, obsession with time’s texture, desire to pass that insight on) are clear and consistently dramatized, and his final choice—to spend his last hours embedding messages—is well motivated. However, his inner life is relatively unconflicted; he moves from curiosity to clarity to acceptance without much visible struggle or contradiction. Elara functions primarily as a receiving vessel rather than a fully realized character, which limits relational pressure. The ending endurance/renunciation (accepting death to preserve understanding) is credible but could carry more on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are specific and consistent, and her choices—approaching the kite, claiming the feather, using it to write, leaving the kite—track cleanly with her worldview. However, she experiences almost no real internal contradiction or fraying under pressure; her stance is affirmed rather than challenged. The result is a finely drawn but relatively untested character, which limits depth at this length and ambition level.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline and consistent—honor the island and restore the covenant before he dies—and his actions align tightly with that goal. His interiority is concrete in ritual and sensation (hand on bark, feeling the “faint hum of intention”) rather than labels. However, he is almost entirely without contradiction or moral friction; there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond physical decline. That lack of internal tension keeps the characterization from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aris’s motivations (scientific rigor, rebellious skepticism, need to validate her theory) are clear and drive her choices, especially rejecting the main gate and following the footprints. Her flaw—intellectual arrogance—softens credibly into awe in the chamber, giving her a modest but earned internal shift. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally summarized (“luminous skeptic,” “quiet revolution”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the peak beat. Elias functions well as a foil but remains more schematic than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s vow and long-held burden are clear and specific, and his emotional responses to the birds’ messages and the submerged concord give him texture. His interiority is mostly embedded in perception and ritualized action rather than explicit thought, which works but keeps him a little iconic. There’s limited on-page contradiction or struggle—he never really wavers—so the arc feels more like steady enactment than pressured change. The closing warmth and tears are earned but relatively low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s grief, sensory way of thinking, and long-retired competence make him feel specific and alive, and his micro-choices (refusing Anya, obsessively testing methods, then deciding to leave) track cleanly with his motives. The embodied details around Elara (scent of rain in her hair, cadence of her laugh) deepen his interiority beyond stock mourning. Internal conflict—his vow of retirement versus the pull of the cylinder/leaf—could surface with more friction at the decision point; he gives in a bit too smoothly for such a life-altering reversal. Still, the final renunciation of safety for hope feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—moving from ritualized grief to active investigation—is clear, coherent with her history, and sharpened by the anniversary frame. Her interiority is specific and grounded in objects (compass rose, sketchbook) rather than labels. However, her emotional state evolves smoothly rather than under genuine contradiction; there’s little sense of simultaneous, competing impulses during the key discovery. The closing stance feels earned but relatively low-cost, more a deepening of an existing disposition than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, consistent, and particular—his chivalrous code and apprentice-of-wonder stance cleanly drive his mission to repair the sky. Interiority is present in how he experiences each piece (greed seeping despair, warmth touching the chamber), but internal conflict is minimal; he rarely doubts, struggles, or wavers. The “cautious abandon” is told more than dramatized as contradictory impulses in-scene, which keeps his arc from feeling truly costly. The closing realization about “the greatest theft” feels earned but a bit neat, without a sharp internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and the “crisis actor turned real survivor/historian” frame is distinctive. However, her interiority remains more emblematic than deeply conflicted; we rarely feel competing impulses in the moment, only a steady, resolved purpose. “Benevolently ruthless” is asserted but not really tested against resistance or objection on the page. The companions (“nomadic penumbra”) function more as chorus than as relational pressure that forces difficult, character-revealing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-avoidance vs truth-seeking conflict is clear and embodied in concrete choices, especially setting aside the mercury glass and choosing to seed a raw memory. The emotional motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) is particular and consistent. However, her interiority sometimes leans on slightly generalized formulations (“exquisite pain of remembering”) rather than fully idiosyncratic thought. The final shift feels earned but could show a bit more irrational resistance or contradiction in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s guilt, self-imposed exile, and disciplined, chess-like problem solving create a specific, psychologically coherent figure whose final inner shift feels earned by the decoding work. The productive fidgeting with the silver thread is an excellent behavioral throughline that becomes character-revealing and thematically charged. His atonement arc—from fixation on a single blunder to accepting a protective, humble stance—is credible and clearly motivated. The main limit at this tier is that his internal conflict remains relatively one-note (guilt → focused atonement) without much on-page contradiction or resistance as he proceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply articulated and consistently enacted—her drive to “refract” the official story clearly powers her choices and the communal shift. Her blend of defiance and gentleness feels specific and credible, and Borin’s status shift is nicely handled. However, Elara experiences little on-page internal contradiction or fear under pressure; she reads almost serenely correct, which slightly flattens complexity. A touch more visible cost or hesitation in her would deepen the characterization to a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s grief-driven motivation is clear and specific—"not to escape oblivion, but to conjure meaning from its very edge"—and his micro-choices in the ritual align tightly with that. His interiority is vivid and embodied (lungs burning, tears cutting through grime), though the piece leans more on sustained intensity than on contradictory impulses in live tension. The final acceptance of the workshop’s sinking reads as an earned stasis, not a facile epiphany. A slightly broader palette of conflicting desires under pressure (terror vs. composure, doubt vs. faith) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief, nostalgia, and self-concept as a quay painter are specific and embodied, and his choices (undertaking the walk, continuing after the fall, relinquishing the shell) are clearly motivated. The internal shift from clinging to grief to accepting fracture reads earned by prior images and memories. However, his conflict between holding on and letting go is articulated more in thematic language than dramatized through competing impulses on the page. The resolution feels slightly tidy, with limited messiness in his emotional contradictions at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s grief, gentleness, and philosophical bent are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized through his choices with the vial and his refusal to “shout.” His embodied emotion—trembling hands, bone-deep humming—feels specific rather than generic. The dynamic with Silas gains depth once Silas arrives, and the status inversion (the blustering superior humbled by the assistant) is convincing. The main limitation is that Elias’s internal conflict is relatively straightforward; contradictory impulses could be sharpened for even greater complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to navigate grief rather than fix the station—is clear, consistent, and tied to concrete choices like building the memory-circuit. Her interiority is fairly specific (patchwork body, tactile engagement with tools and relics), but conflicting impulses (clinging vs. letting go) could be dramatized more sharply rather than mostly summarized as a “reverse migration.” The final change (accepting the station as home again without repairing hydraulics) feels earned and rooted in earlier beats. A touch of therapy-like abstraction (“geography of loss,” “raw solace”) slightly flattens her particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific, with her rational method and fierce care for Lena coming through in concrete actions (harvesting the truffle, smuggling the eye). The empathy virus as backstory credibly shapes her choices. Internal contradiction is relatively subdued—she’s steady rather than torn—which keeps this just shy of the top band, but the Earned Stasis at the end (“the ritual might fail, but the attempt itself was a rebellion against despair”) is well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is clearly motivated by a “softly persistent” need to decode the stranger’s gesture, and his role as long-time keeper of others’ tokens feels specific and lived-in. His micro-choices—taking the flower, pressing it into the log, reframing his duty—track cleanly from that core disposition. However, his inner life is largely unconflicted; the emotional arc moves from recognition to affirmation without much contradiction or genuine risk. The result is strong, coherent characterization but not yet piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation—to honor Aris and test their shared belief in wonder—is clean, specific, and consistently drives his choices from shop to cavern. The “empirically intuitive” trait is nicely embodied in the ant-following sequence, showing method under pressure rather than just labeling him. Emotional life is present but skewed toward summary and lyric abstraction (“Tears blurred his vision,” “felt like forgiveness”) rather than more idiosyncratic, embodied contradiction in the peak beats. The final reconfiguration of his loneliness into “resonant connection” is convincing but borders on neatness, with limited sense of lingering flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s central motivation and arc from numb withdrawal to recommitted sovereignty are clear and credible, and her choices (accepting the warning, climbing, asking for truth, deciding to return) are causally grounded in that interior state. The story embodies her emotions through physical action (discarding the cloak, climbing into thin air) as well as reflection, though it leans a bit on summary labels like “disenchantment was washed away” instead of dramatizing the final turn. Internal contradiction—duty vs. craving escape—is present but could be more sharply dramatized under pressure. The fox connection and the starlight revelation do reveal her values, but she remains somewhat idealized, with limited flawed behavior on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharply defined and consistent—she wants to “capture the density of presence”—and her actions align with that throughout. However, she faces little real internal contradiction or doubt; the line “her scientifically romantic heart swelled” crystallizes her but also flattens complexity. Kael and Lyra feel emotionally credible in their brief time on the page, especially in the exchange about loss and “You have me,” yet they function more as exemplars than fully individuated people. The closing realization about value feels earned but somewhat tidy, without a visible cost that exposes a genuine flaw or blind spot.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and particular: the mix of terror, “feral nostalgia,” corrosive jealousy, and eventual “jaded wonder” feels grounded in his history and vocation. His motive—to metabolize the shock of seeing his own grave by turning it into narrative—is clear and drives his choice to enter the lucid dream. Contradictory impulses (envy of his past selves vs. tenderness toward them) play out on the page, especially in the wave-from-22 moment. The only limiting factor is that his final acceptance lands a touch smoothly for the extremity of the crisis, though it’s still mostly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—her loss of smell, tactile compensations, and vocational grief all feel lived-in, and her motivation to “unveil the ordinary miracle” is coherent. The relationship dynamic with Mrs. Gable is sketched with efficient, sharp detail (the clutching of the pouch, the slack hinge, the “shadow of fear”). What’s missing for a higher score is more active contradiction in Elara under pressure; she rarely feels genuinely torn or destabilized in the present moment. Her closing sense of wholeness is emotionally plausible but arrives a bit too smoothly, without a clear on-page moment where she almost fails or chooses against her own comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation (transforming scars into stories) is clear, consistent, and directly drives each choice, especially her decision to risk re-entering the trauma via the tear ritual. Her interiority is specific and embodied (the cool stone, the trembling wrist, the remembered glass) rather than generic. The internal conflict between scholarly skepticism and childhood superstition plays on the page rather than in summary, culminating in an earned shift. The only limit, at this standard, is the relative simplicity of her flaw set—her contradictions are strong but not especially thorny or multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and specific, and her profession as a gossip-column exorcist nicely embodies her core flaw (weaponizing words) and her attempt at repair. Her interiority is largely conveyed through concrete objects (the bottle, the music) rather than abstract labels, which works well, but we see relatively little in-the-moment hesitation or contradictory impulse once the ritual begins—her path feels almost too smooth. Valerius’s grief and eventual softening are legible but somewhat idealized; his forgiveness comes quickly, with minimal resistance. The final shift—her apology delivered and partially self-healing—feels earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and role are sharply defined, and her interiority—especially around solitude and memory—feels particular rather than generic. Her choices (which words to repair, how to define them, ultimately refusing to define “existence”) clearly align with her values. However, internal conflict is underplayed; she rarely wavers or contradicts herself, so her change from “witness” to “weaver” reads more as a naming shift than a fully dramatized struggle. The emotional cost of bearing all memory is gestured at but could use one more concrete, embodied moment under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shepherd’s obsession with what clocks “really measure” is specific and embodied through his ritual with the key and droplet, and his final peace feels earned by that long pursuit. However, his interiority remains relatively uni-directional—he rarely experiences genuine contradiction or resistance to his own quest, which slightly flattens him. The moment with the mentor key handoff adds texture but doesn’t expose a live internal conflict, only deepens vocation. The closing acceptance is credible and motivated, but the cost of that acceptance could be more sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara and Kael are cleanly sketched with distinct roles, grief histories, and values, and their motives are coherent and aligned with the situation. Elara’s professional drive and private need “to understand the physics of letting go” dovetail credibly, and Kael’s caretaking of the fungi as a ritual for his wife is specific and embodied. However, internal conflict is relatively gentle—there’s little sense of her resisting the lesson or risking a wrong choice—and emotional language occasionally edges toward therapy-speak abstraction. The final shift feels earned but not deeply contested on the page, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief, intellectual inheritance, and desire to diverge from her father’s gambler lens are distinct and motivate every choice, especially following the clue to the “clock that forgot time.” The internal arc from “theoretically rebellious” protest to synthesis is clear and earned. However, her contradictions stay relatively tidy—there’s little mess or self-sabotage under pressure, and no other on-page character to stress-test her. The cost of her new stance is more implied than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive and inner stance are sharply defined—“cultivated estrangement” and her quiet vocation with wrong numbers give her credible, specific purpose under pressure. The caller’s grief is sketched efficiently but vividly through his compulsive dialing loop. Her shift from fortress to harbor reads as an earned, modest reconfiguration rather than a tidy epiphany. The main limitation is that internal contradiction (her own pain vs. her helping role) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are rich, specific, and consistent, and her archivist identity meaningfully shapes every choice. The emotional arc from grief as “weight” to grief as “blossoms” is clearly earned by the ritual and her history with Elias. What’s missing for the very top tier is sharper internal contradiction under pressure—she moves toward release with very little resistance, doubt, or messiness. A touch more friction or self-sabotage in the middle beats would deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction are clear and specific—she chases disasters to cure her own loneliness while armoring herself in forced jocularity—and her shift from seeking a cure to catalyzing it is earned by the encounter. The moon rock, past mission in Nepal, and avalanche-valley memory all deepen her psychology rather than decorating it. The internal change at the end forecloses a prior path (rootless motion as self-medication) with a visible emotional cost. The one weakness is a slight over-clarity in articulating her realization rather than letting more of it stay embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and inner state are clear, embodied, and particular—her grief, tactile perception, and reverence for the ring feel specific rather than generic. Her choices (entering the forest, trusting the ring, kneeling at the stillpoint, accepting the reframed loss) track cleanly with that motivation. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; she rarely wavers or resists, so the emotional arc reads a bit smooth and epiphanic. The final realization lands, but with limited on-page struggle or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s guilt, professional pride, and drive to “thresh meaning” are specific and consistent, and her shift from isolated self-blame to contextualized responsibility feels earned. The pen’s bent nib, her memory of silencing doubt, and her choice to send glyphs instead of seeking impossible redemption all reveal a layered interiority. Contradictory impulses—shame vs. duty, despair vs. curiosity—coexist credibly. A slight over-articulation of her realizations in abstract terms keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply realized: his grief, ritual, and history with Anya give him a specific, coherent interior life, and his shift from solitary mapping to shared invitation feels earned. Lily is a bit idealized but functions well as a counterpoint to his isolation. Emotional states are mostly embodied in gesture and image, not just labels, though phrases like “joyful sorrow” lean abstract. The final choice to keep returning to the harbor clearly crystallizes his values with a visible emotional cost (continuing to live inside loss).

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s guilt, history as an arsonist, and tenderness toward the artifacts create a specific, embodied interiority, with details like “his hands…now lifted the fragment with volcanic tenderness” revealing genuine change under pressure. His motivation (Elara’s promise and the poisoned valley) is clear and consistently drives each micro-choice along the trail. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in-the-moment—he doesn’t seriously waver or risk backsliding—but the past/present contradiction is strong enough to feel like a real arc. The final act of meticulous copying as atonement is well-earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to revive the shared dream as an act of quiet rebellion—is clear, specific, and coherently drives all of his actions. His emotions are embodied through tactile interaction with the garden and lagoon, though his inner life leans more unified (devotion/grief) than genuinely conflicted. The sense of cost at the end—exhaustion, tears, and renewed resolve—feels earned. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or moral friction in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael is sharply outlined as a meticulous, quietly confident maintenance worker whose long intimacy with the port and commitment to subtlety shape every choice. His motivation—to prove his philosophy to Vale while rescuing him—is clear and grounded in their earlier public clash. However, his interiority is mostly serene and assured; we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or emotional degradation under stress, which keeps the arc from feeling fully three-dimensional. Vale’s shift from skeptic to awed observer is credible but compressed, with limited texture beyond his role as foil.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael and Elara are clearly defined in role and affect, and his wordless ministry comes through in concrete actions (mirror, shutters) rather than exposition. However, Elara’s “half-spoken secret” remains entirely abstract, so her despair risks feeling generic rather than character-particular. The emotional progression—from crisis to release—is believable but a bit too smooth, with little contradictory impulse or real resistance on the page. The final shift reads earned enough for flash, but not deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is vivid, specific, and consistent—“to plant forests of second thoughts” is strongly dramatized in his coaching gestures and the window displays. His gift (hearing unspoken words) gives us textured interiority, especially with Leo. However, he borders on saintly; there’s little contradiction or visible flaw, and his internal conflict under pressure is muted. The relationship with Leo lands emotionally but doesn’t materially alter their dynamic beyond affirming what was already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s pacifist pirate past, dock-worker present, and yearning for nonviolent freedom are clear and coherent, and the scrimshaw functions well as an externalization of her inner vow. Her emotions are often embodied in sea- and labor-inflected images rather than labels. However, the crucial inner conflict at the ritual moment resolves a bit too smoothly; her surrender to gentleness isn’t strongly contested on the page, so the “unlocking” feels more enacted than struggled for. A touch more dramatized resistance or contradiction in the present scene would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific, with his street-performer-trained blankness, role as propaganda symbol, and guilt over Elara creating a layered, credible psyche. The morally fraught choice to perform cheer at her bedside and to use her bouquet in his ritual dramatizes real internal contradiction rather than tidy resolution. His micro-choices in the present—continuing the theatrical narration, accepting the splinter as “offering,” carving and placing the sparrow—track cleanly to his motives and flaws. The ending’s softened face and unhidden tear feel earned as an incremental but meaningful shift rather than an epiphany reset.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s aesthetic obsession and drive to cross sacred boundaries are clear and consistent, and their choices (touching the quartz, paraphrasing the prohibition) align cleanly with those motives. However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or visible struggle; they never seriously doubt, hesitate, or pay a felt emotional price beyond a generalized “tremor of certainty.” The arc from anticipation to peace is believable but smooth, with little sense of risk. This keeps the character from feeling as complex or pressured as a top-tier literary protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara and Kael both feel particular and grounded, with clear motives—her drive to locate beauty in scars, his shame over “failures”—and their choices genuinely reshape each other. Her plant-arrangement language and sensory palette, and his relationship to glass and breath, individualize them. The mutual awakening is earned, though the emotional transition is slightly smooth, with little visible resistance once they begin to speak. A hint more contradiction or cost in their interior shifts would push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the “texture of connection”—is clear, embodied in her ritual with the bells and lens, and paid off in the music-box revelation. Her interiority is particular and mostly shown through sensory attention rather than labels. However, she is almost entirely self-possessed and correct, with little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle, which flattens potential complexity. Dr. Aris functions mainly as a foil, and the relationship never quite becomes a crucible that forces costly choices between them.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s grief, avoidance of her tools, ritual with the cranes, and final return to the bench all track as a clear, motivated arc. Her internal conflict—refusing her craft without Lena vs. needing it to carry Lena forward—feels specific and embodied. The choice to leave the stencil in the locket at the observatory instead of hoarding it is a credible, costly turn. The only limiter is that her contradictions remain relatively safe and tidy for work aiming at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is vividly realized through her tactile relationship with tools, method, and lineage; Leo is sketched more lightly but gains specificity via the pottery class and handwritten letters. Motivation is crystalline for both: she maps cultural aftershocks, he seeks orientation after loss. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure—Elara’s “steadily curious” steadiness is almost too frictionless. Leo’s emotional turn feels earned but somewhat easy, with little sense of competing impulses in the core scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained: a historian willing to risk her own innocence to gain forbidden knowledge that might save her people. Interiority is textured and embodied (uneven breath, leaping thoughts, sweat under the veil) and her contradictions—love for the past vs. refusal to be ruled by it—are dramatized in the core atom scene. The final shift from “keeper of records” to “guardian of balance” is credibly earned by what she endures in the ritual. There’s slight safety-hedging in how unambiguously wise and controlled she remains, but it doesn’t damage the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to “preserve the shape of hope”—is clear, particular, and consistently drives her choices from initial suspicion to methodical investigation and final surrender. Her flaw (clinging to stasis) credibly blinds her for years and makes the eventual regret feel earned. The decisive inner turn, when she recognizes the shadow as catalyst rather than corruption, grows organically from what we’ve seen of her reverent, cautious temperament. The arc is slightly tidy and epiphany-forward, but still convincing at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and core wound are clear and specific: betrayal of her faith in shared love for wildlife, and the need to reconcile compassion with self-protection. Her internal arc from shame and self-blame to tempered discernment is coherent and earned by the sequence of “shedding layers.” However, her emotional processing unfolds with unusually smooth, almost didactic clarity—there’s little mess, irrationality, or genuine back-and-forth that would deepen complexity. Occasional therapy-adjacent abstractions (“reconstruct her foundation of trust,” “fragile convictions”) slightly flatten what could be more embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and flaw are sharply defined (“closure seeker who... opened wounds wider”), and her internal shift to honoring scars as tunnels feels earned by the sequence of plant-visions and reflections. We get embodied perception (bandage, metallic taste, stitch pain) that grounds her realizations. The conflict between her compulsion to reopen wounds and her emerging willingness to simply witness is clear, though it resolves somewhat cleanly for such a deep-seated pattern. The absence of relational pressure keeps the arc a bit hermetic, limiting emotional complication.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply etched—a former crystal gazer turned celluloid diviner with a distinctive way of mapping emotions as landscapes—but she encounters little true resistance, so her inner conflict remains muted. Her motive (“to find where unused love is stored”) is clear and guides all her actions. The shift from seeking an answer to accepting a quieter, less spatially literal truth is credible but low-friction. More visible ambivalence or risk (personal stakes beyond curiosity and insight) would move this toward top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief and blocked creativity provide a clear, consistent motivation that directly drives her choices, especially the decision to perform the ritual and then to surrender to “rest.” Her interiority is concrete in key places (e.g., memories of her grandmother, the feel of the astrolabe, the bite of cold air) and her fear of pain bound up with beauty is a credible internal contradiction. The final shift—recognizing the cage as self-made and accepting rest—is earned by the buildup of images and memories. Some moments veer toward generalized abstraction (“trapped creativity uncoiled softly”) rather than revealing further character-specific texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guard’s motivation and choices are clear and consistent—he walks, finds an unlit hollow, and enacts the charm in line with his role as protector/cultivator. The dreamlessness nicely explains his emotional restraint and relation to the archive, and the reframing from “guard” to “cultivator” lands as an earned yet quiet evolution. However, internal contradiction is minimal by design; the lack of dreams also flattens potential conflict between duty and personal desire. We see endurance and devotion, but not much active struggle within him in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael’s core motivation and temperament are clear, and his actions (listening to the trees, following the map, placing the gear) align with that interior. However, he reads more as an emblematic seeker than a fully individuated person, with very little on-page contradiction or struggle. References to past fear and confusion are summarized instead of dramatized, so the final peace costs him little in the scene itself. The result is emotionally pleasant but not yet at a depth where his change feels hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her emotional state is well embodied in the landscape and her reactions to the guides. Internal conflict exists (fear/caution vs. desire for courage) but remains relatively gentle, with few sharp, contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment. The guides function more as archetypal presences than individuated people, though their calm and tenderness are consistent. The final realization is earned by the walk and the ticket’s accumulation of stars, but the cost of change feels modest and somewhat idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt, physical pain, and sense of duty are vividly embodied, and her final choice—to remain with the truth and reconfigure her role—feels earned by prior beats. The internal conflict between obedience/silence and responsibility/truth is active in scene, not just summarized. Kael is rendered through specific, telling memories that deepen her motivation. The only drag is a slight tilt toward thematic formulation in her realizations, which occasionally smooths over messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and the closing renunciation (accepting dissolution instead of reclaiming the throne) feels earned by his longstanding duty-first stance. However, his interiority is almost entirely serene and unconflicted—“He felt no bitterness, only duty”—which flattens complexity and denies us contradictory impulses under pressure. The lack of on-page struggle or doubt around centuries of exile strains believability for a sentient being, even a nearly saintly one. Emotional response is mostly summarized rather than embodied, keeping characterization from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s grief, professional history, and tactile rituals create a specific, embodied interiority; the coral witness detail and salt-stiffened suit root her as a lived person rather than a symbol. Her motivation—to understand disappearing paths—is clear and echoed across ecological, cartographic, and emotional registers. The decisive shift from “drifting moored” to “keeper of rhythms” feels earned by prior setup (her tapping, isolation, and loss). What’s missing for the very top band is stronger on-page contradiction—her conflict is deep but largely one-directional rather than showing impulses in active collision within a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and inner life are clear, specific, and consistent—the barefooted mechanic uneasy in a mystic role, driven by a “persistent, quiet ache” for meaning. His embodied responses (cold permacrete, vibration through bare feet, tear cutting grime) keep emotion grounded. The contradiction between practical mechanic and spiritual seeker is well handled and credibly resolved into a new stance. The one weakness is how smoothly the final resolve arrives; the emotional integration edges toward tidy rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is vivid and specific—an aging insurgent turned healer whose plant-telepathy and history with the springs give her real texture. Her motivation to reject passive tradition in favor of intentional evolution is clear and consistently dramatized. The main limitation is the relative ease of her central choice: she "scoffs" at the elder scrolls and proceeds with little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. A touch more visible inner conflict around defying a sacred rule would deepen the arc and raise the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is specific, embodied, and psychologically legible; the drone-strike backstory and her botanical practice combine into a coherent, felt interior life. The somatic responses (freeze, touch, breath) read as lived-in rather than generic. However, the text leans on conceptual/clinical framings (“somatic markers,” “motivation was to anchor optimism in realism”) that edge into essay-voice and slightly flatten her messiness. Her final state—“not restored, but remade”—is earned, but rendered with more thesis than contradiction in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and flaw are clear and consistent—his avoidance of emotional depth directly causes the crisis and drives his decision to descend and reweave. Interiority is specific and embodied (“crestfallen thread—a tight knot of shame”) rather than generic, and his shift from numb flight to compassionate engagement feels earned. There is some mild therapy-speak shorthand (“self-compassion”) but it doesn’t undercut the emotional arc. The final change costs him his protective numbness and commits him to a harder practice of truthful art.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation and interior texture (“serene anger,” “consciously wild”) are vivid and consistent, and his final renunciation (not rebuilding the drone) is legible and earned. However, his internal conflict is largely conceptual; contradictory impulses don’t really clash on the page, so the shift from anger to acceptance feels a touch too smooth. The emotional journey is convincing but could use one sharper moment where cost bites harder.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are sharply defined—duty vs. conscience, fear vs. action—and her final choice feels earned by the buildup (“Bravery was action despite fear. Her thumb pressed transmit.”). We get concrete interiority (the warmth of the letter, the pressure of the snow, the frantic heart) rather than abstract labels. The contradiction between professional composure with Kael and inner turmoil is effective. A slight tendency to state her moral frame explicitly (“Her motivation was not rebellion, but redemption”) keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s pacifism versus her inheritance of a violent legacy is clear, specific, and embodied in concrete rituals like handling and re-sheathing the knife. Her interiority feels particular (sensory attunement, tenderness toward the roses) rather than generic. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is largely settled before the story begins; we see reaffirmation rather than a pressured, evolving struggle. The final identity claim (“no longer just the bounty hunter’s pacifist daughter”) is emotionally apt but not strongly re-earned by a new on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (catching Lyra’s echo) is clear and consistent, and her grief for her daughter gives the final choice emotional weight. Her competence under pressure feels earned and her micro-choices (driving in the spike, allowing grief to surface) track cleanly with her traits. Internal contradiction is present but muted—she adapts and succeeds with relatively little genuine faltering or self-sabotage, which slightly flattens complexity. The closing transformation is credible but edges toward tidy serenity rather than a more ambivalent, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in both professional identity and personal love for her grandfather, and her methodical, logical temperament is consistently dramatized through action. However, her internal conflict (grief vs rational duty; loyalty vs exposure) is gestured at more than fully dramatized, so we rarely see genuinely competing impulses in live tension. Her ultimate choice to publish feels earned but relatively low-friction, with little sense of what it might cost her socially or emotionally beyond a tear and a comforting frame of “grace.” The result is a strong, coherent characterization that stops short of truly searing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—hushing the dissonance of guilt rooted in her niece’s unanswered cry—is clear, consistent, and nicely particular. The emotional throughline from her specialized talent (translating baby cries) to recognizing the archived infant’s loneliness is strong and earned. However, her interiority stays relatively smooth and virtuous; contradictory impulses (defensiveness, avoidance, anger at the founder or the machine) could sharpen her under pressure. The final shift toward peace feels believable but slightly tidy for the depth of guilt invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation (“to discover meaning in the mess of her own recent unraveling”) is clear and consistently embodied in her actions, particularly the decision to create and then verbally “complete” the mandala. Her interiority is specific and sensorial—she feels “emotional textures” rather than generic emotions—so she reads as a distinct consciousness, not a type. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is relatively smooth; the anxious “What remains?” beat is resolved quickly, with little sense of real risk she might fail or choose wrongly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to her history; the retrocognitive trap and the “aberrant mercy” stance feel character-particular rather than generic. Her emotional state is consistently embodied (ash under her hands, the tessera in her pocket), and her final release is earned by the prior setup. However, internal conflict is more posited than dramatized—she moves toward renaming with relatively little felt resistance in the moment, which slightly softens the sense of costly choice. Relationships are off-page and thus cannot sharpen her contradictions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s longing and purpose are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through her actions—gathering echoes, focusing on the coin, and finally accepting release. Her synesthetic perceptions give her interiority a particular texture rather than stock emotion words. The internal conflict between clinging to the “possibility” of the duet and accepting she cannot change history is present, though it stays largely implicit until the final passages rather than being sharply tested earlier. Julian is more emblematic than fully characterized, but that fits the piece’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” stance is well realized: her bodily sensations, cautious reasoning, and decision to prioritize Maya’s need over proof feel specific and consistent. The internal conflict between doubt and compassion is present, though her key realization (“not to prove telepathy, but to honor this need”) lands a bit neatly. Maya is sketched more lightly but her grief and hope are legible enough to exert pressure on Elara. The closing gesture of giving Maya the geode convincingly externalizes Elara’s internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation and core motivation are clear and specific, and her reverence for place comes through in embodied detail (bare feet, pigments, kelp-paper). However, she faces little on-page contradiction or moral friction—her impulses are almost uniformly aligned with her purpose—so internal conflict and visible cost remain muted. The final shift into hope is earned but relatively gentle, more a confirmation than a hard-won reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, motive, and temperament are sharply etched—her lifelong cataloging of buttons and refusal to panic at the ceiling crack feel particular and convincing. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradiction; her belief that the prophecy is a cipher is never really tested. The final choice to go to the village at dawn is well-motivated but carries only an implied cost (social risk, effort) rather than a felt, dramatized one. As a result, she reads as strong and steady more than dynamically conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and credible: the burned spy with trembling hands, codes in snow, and the pillbox make his mix of competence and fracture vivid, and his final act of vulnerability feels earned by prior beats. His caution-versus-courage conflict is dramatized rather than merely labeled, especially in his shift from suicide/medication implications to offering the flower. Anya is sketched economically but distinctly, with her line about “messages that couldn’t be held against you” sharply reframing their history and his habits. The arc from self-protective secrecy to shared token of trust carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation—to reconcile his failed promise to Elara with the life he actually gave his daughter—is clear and sustained, and his interiority feels particular rather than generic. The bone yarn needle, his attentive listening, and the embodied memory of Elara’s hands all reveal him under pressure. The internal contradiction (self-blame vs recognition of quiet care) is credible and resolves into an earned stance shift. The only limit, at this length, is that most conflict stays reflective rather than showing more than one concrete present-tense micro-choice under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—his “sharp gentleness” in handling clay and glass coheres well with his pursuit of understanding. We see him act under this value system (careful alignment of the glass, reverent attention to the beekeeper’s memory, decision to carry the lesson outward). What’s missing at this standard is any real internal contradiction or resistance; he never seems truly torn or under emotional pressure. The final “deeper purpose” feels earned but relatively low-cost, more confirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her “wistfully pragmatic” resolve and quiet rebellion feel integral to her choices, especially persisting with the ritual even when its impact is uncertain. The embodied details (calloused hands, shoulder fatigue, palm on the rosebush) ground her emotions. Internal contradiction (clear-eyed about the harbor’s vast darkness yet insisting on tiny acts of light) is present though a bit over-labeled in phrases like “wistfully pragmatic heart.” Mateo functions briefly but effectively as a mirror that sharpens who she is without needing much development himself.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to metabolize isolating reincarnation memories into self-sufficiency—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (seeking the sundial, undergoing the ritual, then writing the folio). The fusion with Kaelen adds layered identity without confusion, and the final stance as “bridge and archivist” feels earned by what we’ve seen. Internal conflict (fear of being consumed vs. desire to honor the legacy) is present but usually resolved smoothly rather than sharply dramatized. A few lines tip toward articulated insight over messy, contradictory emotion, which slightly reduces the sense of lived complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s role, longing, and solitude are clearly and consistently motivated, and her decision to create the installation grows credibly from the twig discovery and her history as a keeper of secrets. The internal arc from untethered observer to participant (“home”) is earned, if gentle. However, her inner life skews more stated than dramatized, with little on-page contradiction or real struggle once the idea appears. The absence of resistance or fear around exposing her own secret slightly flattens what could be a sharper crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—his professional obsession and moral stance drive every choice, especially the decision to risk his job to run the counter-signal. Interiority and embodied emotion (“trembling finger,” “tears traced clean paths”) are strong if somewhat idealized. Internal conflict is underdeveloped; he rarely feels genuinely torn between job security and cosmic duty, which slightly flattens the climax. Still, the final charged poise—accepting Croft’s wrath while holding the line—feels earned by the preceding setup.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation and internal contradiction (crippling claustrophobia vs duty to end the fallow period) are vivid and consistent, and her “prudently adventurous” temperament shows in how she manages fear rather than erasing it. Embodied responses (“panic clawed at her throat,” the tight loft, the clean tear tracks) keep emotions grounded. The final endurance—remaining claustrophobic yet acting anyway—reads as an earned, costly change in stance. A slight tendency toward thematic labeling (“wistful rebellion made manifest”) flattens nuance at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and specific—her face blindness, tactile perception, and reverent method all cohere into a distinct person whose investigative choices feel rooted in who she is. Her motivation to humanize cold cases and “awaken dormant empathy” is clear and carries through to the end. The emotional turn when Clara’s letter pierces her “guarded solitude” is earned by prior setup. What’s missing at a top level is more live contradiction on the page—her impulses largely align rather than clash under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—from her “bureaucratic punishment” assignment to the decoding and confrontation beats. Her emotions are mostly embodied in physical sensations (damp wool, cold nail, barometric pressure) rather than labels. Internal contradiction (fear vs. resolve; exile vs. purpose) is present but lightly sketched, and could be deepened under peak stress. The technician is minimally characterized but functional as immediate pressure rather than a person in his own right.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s grief and blocked artistry are clear and specific (the fallen bridge, twenty years of silence), and his decision to play again with the glass flake on his strings is motivated and credible. However, his interiority leans toward articulated realizations (“This was his motivation made sound”) rather than dramatized contradictory impulses in the moment. We rarely see him genuinely pulled between alternatives; once the revelation starts, acceptance comes smoothly. The transformation is earned enough for this length but lacks the messiness and tension of a fully lived-through internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s motives and history are clear and specific, and the inheritance of both the money and the outlaw/startup legacies gives him dimension. However, his “perceptively calm” wisdom feels largely pre-baked; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle on the page, so his final renunciation reads more confirmatory than hard-won. Kai functions mainly as a foil and prompt, with limited depth beyond “earnest idealist.” The relationship dynamic is legible and thematically relevant but never truly volatile or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and arc are clear and consistent: she starts as an isolated, overburdened watcher and ends by accepting shared vigilance. Her inner life is particularized through vocation-specific details (lucid dream chronicler, variable stars, temple glyphs), not stock “burnout” language. The cost—relinquishing the pride and habit of carrying everything alone—is present but somewhat smoothed over; her shift feels a touch easy. Thomas and Kael function well as pressure and support, though the on-page relationship dynamics remain relatively understated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s guardedness, task as “one who finds lost things,” and need to unbend are woven into concrete choices, especially the decision to use a flesh-eating seed that demands inner vulnerability to wield. The internal contradiction—warlike serenity versus long-held rigidity—operates in scene rather than as summary only. Her acceptance at the end (“I was wrong. I am sorry.”) is earned by the prior reveal that the frozen confession is her own, not a late graft. The only limit is that, with no other on-page character, her flaw is never stress-tested in a live interpersonal crucible, which would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal, history with the Sentinel Oak, and embodied sensations (“tremor in her marrow,” scars flaring) give her a specific, grounded interiority. Motivation is clear and consistent, and micro-choices (kneeling to the oak, following the maze path, pressing the clipping into the rift) align with it. However, she is almost entirely competent and unconflicted; there’s little genuine moral or psychological friction beyond pain, which keeps the arc from feeling truly hard-won. The shift from “anxious elation” to peace is emotionally plausible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is vivid and specific—atonement for having "stole Elara’s future"—and his actions align cleanly with that drive. Embodied emotion appears in concrete gestures (brushing moss from a child’s skull, placing the river stone), which keeps him from feeling generic. However, he moves through the scene with almost untroubled certainty; there’s little simultaneous pull between cowardice/self-protection and sacrifice, so the final acceptance of her sorrow feels more inevitable than hard-won. The closing lines edge toward summary of his arc rather than dramatizing a final, ambiguous internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leo’s interiority is rich, specific, and plausibly shaped by his background; the roadie details and appraisal mindset feel lived-in, and his micro-choices (turning to the box, reciting facts, then abandoning them) track a coherent emotional arc. The internal contradiction between his fact-armoring and his longing for authentic, unsung service is well dramatized rather than merely stated. The decisive change—abandoning auction houses for a new, quieter vocation—feels earned from prior beats. The main limitation is a slightly tidy, self-aware articulation of his insight in therapy-adjacent language (“emotion was the compass”) that flattens lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s characterization is rich and specific: his grief, scholarly rigor, and obsessive drive all feel organically rooted in precise details like his note-taking and the Akkadian farewell. The long pursuit of Elara’s spirit and his reliance on ancient tablets create a believable psychology. His final shift—from fixated observer to “gardener of hope”—is motivated by those traits and carries a felt cost. The internal conflict (control vs. compassion/acceptance) could surface with slightly more in-scene friction, but it’s still convincingly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—“to preserve wonder in routine”—is clear, consistent, and expressed in concrete ritual choices like how she places and works with the creel. Her internal contradiction (identity shifting with moon phases yet accepted as wholeness) is thematically rich and embodied rather than abstract. However, she never faces a genuinely dissonant or costly choice; her stance is affirmed more than it’s tested, so the arc reads as deepening serenity rather than pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and coherent: the bunker inspector’s hyper-attunement to fortifications and isolation filters every perception and makes his arc toward vulnerability convincing. His motivation (to dissolve walls between hearts) is clearly rooted in grief and occupational habit, and the moment of choice with the pearl is well-earned by prior interiority. Internal conflict—his reflex to fortify versus his yearning to connect—is present, though often articulated in elevated thematic language rather than messier, more contradictory impulses. The emotional embodiment is strong but slightly idealized, with very little pettiness or resistance left in him by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation, guilt, and profession interlock cleanly, and her micro-choices (coming off medication, bringing the accordion, leaving the map) are all legible under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and particular (“treating this pilgrimage like a river survey”), not generic. The final stance—choosing an ongoing practice of forgiveness rather than a single fix—feels earned by what we’ve seen. There is a slight tidiness to the epiphany that brushes against sentimentality but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and arc are clear and specific—her lifelong search, her compulsion to document, and the buried need to apologize all cohere. The internal contradiction (joy of discovery vs fear of the incoming letter and her own silence) is present but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Her decisive shift—from observer to participant, culminating in writing and then speaking—feels earned by the prior beats. The confidence man remains a sketch rather than an active relational crucible, but that’s acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—choosing between the Archive’s ethos and the mulberry’s living legacy—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through embodied sensations (stone in her chest, cold of the violin) and micro-choices (performing the coffee ritual, lifting the bow). Her internal conflict between preservation and sacrifice is present, though she rarely wavers in a way that feels truly destabilizing, so the struggle reads intense but somewhat foregone. The telepathic bond with the mulberry gives her emotions a distinctive contour rather than stock grief. The final choice and its cost are fully earned by the setup and prior visions.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, vow, and reverent competence are clear and specific, and her actions consistently arise from that motivation. However, her interiority remains largely serene and single-note; there’s little on-page contradiction or real doubt under pressure. Embodied emotion shows in details like the single tear and her ritual gestures, but we rarely feel genuine struggle. The final stance of grateful acceptance is credible yet not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is specific, coherent, and motivated—her caretaker role, age, and ritualized habits create a believable inner life, and her desire for contentment aligns with her choices to climb, decide, and carve. However, the core conflict between lingering resentment and forgiveness stays mostly stated rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. Her emotional state is serene and reflective almost throughout, with little visible degradation or strain under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but relatively low-cost because we don’t see her actively wrestle with the “unforgivable” in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s guilt and Elara’s practiced, almost professional compassion are sharply drawn, with clear motives and a believable emotional arc from self-condemnation to nuanced self-acceptance. The physicalization of his psychology via the shard and cloak grounds his interiority. The main limitation is that his shift comes a bit smoothly—his resistance could spike harder before he chooses to unhook the cloak—so the internal contradiction under peak pressure feels slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris is specific and compelling: a reverse-aging researcher whose bodily condition and grief history plausibly shape his worldview and choices. His motivation to “teach vanishing to appear” is clear and consistent, and his decision to keep withholding his most personal layer of grief feels earned. However, his internal conflict is often articulated in abstract thesis language rather than dramatized through more textured, moment-to-moment impulses. The result is strong characterization that stops short of feeling fully messy or unpredictable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Corbin’s motivation—“to learn to navigate without moving”—is clear, specific, and consistently rooted in his reverence for the canyon and his own physical frailty. His interiority is strongly implied through imagery and choices (treating bones as libraries, returning the arrowhead as a “seed returned to the archive”), though we rarely see truly contradictory impulses in live tension. The final endurance/renunciation—becoming a fixed harmonic anchor instead of a moving seeker—is earned and maps cleanly to his established values. A touch more on-page struggle or ambivalence in the moment of integration would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motives and values are precise and consistent—her preference for hand-drawn spells, her reframing of punishment as pilgrimage, her refusal to take the keystone, and her turn to the moonflower all grow from the same core. Interiority is sensorial and specific (“weight of a sun-warmed river stone,” “grandmother’s hum”) rather than generic. The internal conflict between guild expectations and her devotion to slowness is present but could surface with a touch more friction in the spire sequence, where external pressure is minimal. Her final stance—tending a single seed instead of chasing guild validation—reads as an earned renunciation with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation (discovering the color of sound) is clear, specific, and coherently tied to his grief for Elara and his lamplighter role. His defining flaw—hiding behind factual precision—is thematically strong and is explicitly challenged when he reads the log (“this was not a fact to analyze but an emotional truth”). The closing choices (weeping, reinterpreting Elara’s voice, leaving the key tag) convincingly mark a before/after. The main limitation is that his “hiding behind truth” is told more than dramatized in on-page interactions, so his contradiction under pressure is somewhat summarized rather than lived in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—“to wavelength align with purpose” and to serve as a conscious witness—is clear, consistent, and credibly culminates in her acceptance of the archivist role. Her quiet enthusiasm vs. “stellar doubt” forms a real, if gentle, internal tension that is paid off when she reframes her vigil as sacred rather than futile. However, the internal conflict almost always trends toward serenity; we rarely see genuinely destabilizing impulses or ugly contradictions, so the cost of her final stance feels somewhat abstract. Strong specificity in her rituals with the coins and static listening does reveal character under pressure, but the pressure is low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s grief, love for Elara, and need to repurpose his role as reaper into “namer of shadows” are clear and motivating, and his actions (undertaking the ritual, especially naming the Void of Unmourned Goodbyes) align well with those motives. The interiority is textured (“tears of pure energy traced his shadowy cheeks”) and particular rather than generic. However, his internal conflict is relatively smooth—there’s little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse at peak beats, so his final shift feels more like a linear completion than a pressured, contested choice. This keeps the emotional arc strong but short of fully layered complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is specific, consistent, and scaled well to the stakes: a lukewarm mage driven by stubborn, brittle devotion to repair a cosmic wrong via mundane observation. Her interiority feels concrete (the counting of drops, the remembered stories, the trust in micro-sensations like the faint hum), but she rarely experiences true contradictory impulses—doubt and fear are mostly kept off the page. The final endurance choice (accepting many future dawns of patient work) is earned and legible, but the lack of real internal friction under pressure keeps this just short of top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and ethic (“precisely humane”) are clear and consistently dramatized in her refusal to treat the bottle as a dead artifact, and the directive vs. conscience tension is specific rather than generic. Her grief around the cerulean liqueur memory reads embodied and particular. Internal conflict (duty to “expunge” vs. urge to rescue and re-story) is live in the key beat where she decides what to do with the bottle. Occasionally the narration labels her virtue a bit abstractly, softening some of the messiness that might deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to reconcile logic and intuition—is clear, consistent, and directly drives her choices, especially her refusal to use brute flame and her adoption of the starlings’ pattern. Interiority is particular, grounded in concrete objects (the dew crystal, the river stone, the grimoire) and her relationship to her late mentor. The internal conflict between “clinical precision” and “secretly sentimental” lands on the page rather than being merely stated, and the final integration feels earned by prior beats. The only limitation is that the emotional cost of failure is more declared than viscerally felt in her body at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving trust after a past failure) is clear, embodied in the parachute buckle and her hyper-attention to patterns. Interiority is concrete and particular—muscle memory, breath in the cold, the physical act of revising the log. The internal conflict (fear of repeating failure vs duty to report truth) is present but could sharpen via more resistance or temptation to look away. The closing emotional shift feels earned, if a touch tidy and untroubled by lingering doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaela’s motivation—to move beyond numbness—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to vivify the duplicate through acceptance rather than conquest. Her inner state is rendered with some specificity, and the before/after shift at the end feels earned. However, her internal struggle unfolds too smoothly; there’s little in-the-moment contradiction or real resistance once she steps into the ritual, which flattens complexity. A more dramatized push-pull between fear of feeling and desire for connection would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation and temperament are clear, consistent, and particular, and his choices (planting the seed, reviving “The Patient Bloom”) arise credibly from those traits. His interiority is textured, especially in how he reads the seed as a thematic mirror to his abandoned concept. However, his emotional range is fairly narrow—he moves from curiosity to purpose without much contradictory impulse or felt risk. The final realization is earned but comes with little visible cost beyond quiet recommitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and organically tied to his actions; his “sacred duty” to restore laughter convincingly drives the entire ritual. The mix of sorrow and fragile hope is well-embodied in his physicality and choices. Internal contradiction (mourning vs. persistent, almost obsessive tending) is present but could be pushed further under peak pressure. Secondary characters exist only as off-page presences, but they still exert credible emotional pressure through his attention to them.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s conflicting impulses—feral homesickness versus hard-won acceptance—are vivid and specific, and the final renunciation clearly grows from prior practice (“interiorizing exteriors,” befriending uncertainty). The choice to stay carries a felt cost on the page (“every fiber screamed to leap forward”), making the Earned Stasis convincing. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing (“make friends with uncertainty”) edges toward essayistic rather than fully embodied interiority, which keeps this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered: her mix of defiance, sensitivity, and accumulated failure gives her a specific psychology under pressure. Her shift from “repair” to “vivify” and from obedience to self-authorship feels earned by prior beats. However, the “core concept unveiled itself” moment veers into abstract label rather than fully dramatized internal conflict, softening the sense of messy contradiction. The emotional cost is present (blood, tears, despair) but somewhat idealized and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, long-term quest, and specific ritual of discarding assumptions create a clear, particular psyche with a believable shift from “seeker” to “listener.” Her motivation is well-rooted in history (“For thirty years, she had chased complex symphonies in starlight”), and her emotional response to the discovery is embodied (tears, physical sensations). However, internal conflict is relatively smooth and unresisted—she lets go of assumptions with little friction, so contradiction and cost feel muted. The arc is convincing but not yet as knotted or pressured as top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo is clearly drawn as competent, calm, and altruistic; his motivation to save the passengers tracks cleanly from first anomaly to final act. However, he experiences almost no visible doubt, fear, or competing impulse, so the internal conflict is thin and his resilience feels a bit pre-packaged rather than tested. The moment of "understood" in the grotto shortcuts what could have been a more revealing struggle with uncertainty. The closing shift to "guardian of thresholds" is earned but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (“to discover the texture of connection”) is clear, consistent, and directly tied to her professional/ritual practice. Her emotional experience is embodied through sensory perceptions of the gallery and the thread, not just labels. The shift from wanting to dissect connection to wanting to honor it reads earned by the overwhelming eruption of memories. However, her inner life skews more emblematic than contradictory or idiosyncratically human, so the epiphany feels slightly smooth rather than messily conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael is strongly sketched—his scars, reverence for both ocean and stars, and pedagogical patience give him specificity, and Lyra’s arc from skepticism to orientation is credible. Motivation (to reclaim star navigation for a drowned humanity) is clear and embodied in his teaching choices. However, internal contradiction and real emotional friction are mild, and labels like “balancedly curious” and “somber marvel” occasionally substitute for showing conflict. The final change in Lyra feels earned but relatively low-cost, more inspirational than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation and motivation (“to protect vulnerable voices”) are clear and consistently expressed through her choices, especially her careful handling of the hearing aid and her phrasing to Lily. However, she encounters little resistance and shows minimal internal contradiction or genuine struggle, which flattens her arc. Lily is sketched with just enough specificity to feel real, but her function is largely reactive. The emotional palette leans sincere and embodied but is also a bit idealized and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation—to stand by his grandfather and the unremembered—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice from descending despite claustrophobia to leaving the codex behind. His fear is credibly embodied (“concrete throat,” serpent of claustrophobia) and his emotional shift to peace feels earned by what he witnesses. Internal conflict between panic and duty is present but relatively straightforward, with limited contradiction or moral ambiguity. The final renunciation (leaving the codex as beacon) lands as a believable, values-driven act with a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—rectifying her bureaucratic “death” and extracting wisdom from it—and her actions (the ink ritual, the heartbeat counting, the preservation of shard and paper) all align with that drive. The interiority is embodied and specific (heartbeat counts, cold shard, frozen tears) rather than label-only. Internal contradiction is present but muted: fear and hurt are acknowledged yet rapidly sublimated into purpose, making the arc feel slightly tidy. Still, her final stance—choosing clarity and systemic compassion over blame—reads as earned by the prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and role as last speaker are clear and specific, and her copper-veined body plus vow give her a distinct identity. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and we see little in-scene ambivalence or contradictory impulse—her interiority is more stated (sacred vow, weight of centuries) than dramatized under pressure. The rumored curse never truly tests her, which blunts the sense of risk around her choices. The closing acceptance that “her work was done” feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris is sharply drawn—a disgraced, bitter scientist whose skepticism and professional stakes are clear—and her shift from exposer to protector is motivated by concrete events (Lyra’s transformation, Elara’s confession). Her interiority blends professional observation with wounded pride in a character-specific way. Elara and Lyra are slightly more symbolic than individuated, but they still exert real pressure on Aris. The final renunciation of her original goal feels earned, though her inner resistance could tighten a bit more under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation and emotional texture are clear and specific, with nice embodied beats (pressing the locust shell to her chest, torn fingers on stone-thorns). Her choices drive the story, especially the shift from technical perfection to heart-led playing and then to physically uprooting the vines. Internal contradiction is relatively light—her doubts and fears under pressure are implied more than dramatized—so the arc reads clean rather than deeply conflicted. Still, the final understanding about “breaking free” feels earned by prior action rather than parachuted in.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in a concrete wound (his sister’s broken promise of safe passage), and his actions consistently express that drive. The “respectfully rebellious” mode is nicely dramatized in his meticulous observance of protocol paired with covert subversion. However, internal contradiction and in-the-moment conflict are muted; he rarely feels genuinely torn or destabilized, which softens the emotional edge of his choices. Several lines summarize his nature (“He fostered reconciliation…”) rather than revealing new facets under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief, vocation, and long-held muteness are clear and specific, and her decision to sing reads as the natural culmination of her history and temperament. Interiority is largely embodied through tactile perception (wood, brass, dust), giving her a distinct worldview. The main limitation is that her internal conflict—fear of breaking silence versus longing for renewal—stays implied rather than dramatized in more jagged, contradictory impulses under peak pressure, which keeps the emotional turn slightly too smooth for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—her commitment to analog memory and her quest to locate where stories “live” both drive every choice. Embodied details (the scarf against her heart, the way she works the chart) ground her interiority. Internal contradiction is relatively mild: she never seems genuinely tempted by the digital or in doubt about her method, which softens the sense of struggle. The final shift from seeking a location to carrying the “library of folds within her” is earned but not dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s longing and quiet, ritualized perseverance feel specific and credible, and her emotional reaction to the photograph (“Tears traced clean paths…not of sorrow, but recognition”) lands. However, her interiority rarely shows contradictory impulses in-scene; there’s little sense of doubt, resentment, or fear actively competing with hope at the moment of action. The final acceptance—shifting from seeker to keeper of inner light—reads emotionally plausible but comes a bit too cleanly, without visible struggle at the peak beat. This limits the sense of paid cost and complex, flawed humanity expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation is clear and particular—“an improbable longing” to free an idea trapped by fear—but he remains more archetype than fully embodied individual. His competence is unwavering and the ritual unfolds without visible doubt, irritation, or misstep, so we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Elara is effectively a symbol rather than a dramatized character, and their relationship, while poignant, is mostly conceptual. The final choice feels emotionally apt but relatively low-cost for him, tempering the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained: a chronically curious folklorist finally forcing himself to confront the one place that thwarted that curiosity. His fear/avoidance versus drive to know is credibly dramatized, and his emotional responses are embodied (“boots sank into the salt-bleached mud,” tears cutting through grime). The recovered memory of Elara is concise but potent, making their relationship vivid with very little page-time. The final shift—carrying the truth “not as a wound, but as a compass”—feels earned rather than epiphanic shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael and Elara are sharply etched, with clear, particular motives—the quiet mentor who refuses to rescue and the furious exile who distrusts “dust” words. Kael’s backward-walking tic and his choice to resist it at the end give him a small but credible arc of vulnerability. Elara’s shift from dismissive anger to tracing the spiral and writing “Return” feels earned by the mentoring process on the page. The only limit at this length is that Elara’s inner contradiction (grief vs curiosity) is more implied than directly embodied, so her emotional texture never fully deepens into true messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motive (preserving the “color of wonder”) is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a pruner gives her a specific lens on the world. However, she faces almost no real resistance—internal or external—so we don’t see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure. Her emotions are largely filtered through elevated abstractions (“profound connection to the weave”) rather than sharply embodied contradiction. The ending choice reads more as the completion of a ritual than a costly decision that forecloses an alternative self or path.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, weariness, and quiet imperative to ground the spirits are clear and consistent, and her final redefinition of “restoration” feels earned by the ritual. However, her internal conflict stays relatively muted—she is competent and steady throughout, with little on-page hesitation or contradiction under pressure. The line “The lucid unrest that had defined her existence…” gestures at deeper fracture, but those fractures are more told than dramatized in specific moments of doubt. The change at the end is credible and moving, but it could land even harder with more sharply embodied ambivalence earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (patient, reverent, anti-conquest) are clear and consistently embodied in her actions and perceptions. The professional specificity of her work and habits grounds her convincingly. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or on-page cost—she never genuinely wavers, and no choice bites back. The final shift toward “stewardship, not ownership” feels earned but low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s motivation (retrieving the final log to understand “the physics of letting go”) is clear and rooted in his history with Elara, and his analytic temperament shapes how he engages with the snow globe and the tape. The calm, professional relationship with death is a distinctive trait. However, his internal conflict feels relatively tidy: contradictory impulses (clinging vs. releasing) are more summarized than dramatized in present-moment micro-choices. The final shift, while touching, reads slightly like an earned insight rather than a hard-won, messily conflicted turn.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motive—to voice the unspoken needs of others—is clear and consistently embodied in her carving, but she remains almost entirely idealized, with little felt contradiction or flaw. Her emotional state is somewhat abstract (“driftingly alert”) rather than viscerally embodied. The shift from quiet tension to fulfilled purpose at the end lands, yet it carries minimal cost or ambivalence. Character depth is solid but not yet at the complexity expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s curiosity, grief over Lyra, and empathy are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized, especially in his response to the captain’s entries. However, he reads as almost entirely virtuous and self-aware, with little visible contradiction or genuine flaw under pressure. His shift to “affectionate detachment” is earned but emotionally tidy, with limited struggle on the page. The lack of a sharper internal conflict or compromised choice keeps this just short of top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation—to prove that “empty spaces remember” and to memorialize Elara—is clear, specific, and steadily borne out by their choices and attention. The interiority is concrete and character-particular (aviation meteorologist, cloud taxonomy, the comfort of engraved latitude lines). Internal conflict (fear vs. devotion to the experiment and to Elara) is present but could be pushed slightly harder in-scene rather than mostly implied. The final acceptance/peace feels earned by the prior accumulation of observations and memories, with a real emotional cost visible in the breakdown at the fallstreak hole.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivations and sensibility are sharply drawn—face blindness shaping a tactile, material way of knowing is specific and lived-in, and her decades-long sky project gives her present choices weight. Her shift from clinging to preservation to accepting loss and re-framing “limits” feels earned by the encounter with the coin. The cost—the destruction of her life’s work—is clear and not magically erased. Internal contradiction (attachment vs. acceptance) could surface a bit more in-scene under time pressure, rather than mainly in the reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (“diligently curious,” reverent, fond of “sociable isolation”) are clearly and consistently realized, and her actions align with those traits. Her emotional arc from quiet caretaker to “keeper of light” is legible and earned. However, there is little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; she rarely wavers or makes costly mistakes. This keeps her credible but somewhat smooth, limiting deeper complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to master the “rhythm of repair” before her mentor’s hands fail—is concrete, specific, and carried through every choice from seeking the prophecy to her meticulous handling of the lens. Her emotions are well embodied in tactile details (the gear assortment as a heartbeat, tears freezing on her cheeks) and in her sensory attention to tools and light. Internal conflict is present but gentle (longing and nostalgia versus focused, almost devotional work), which fits the quiet mode but keeps the stakes mostly inward. The final realization about honoring rather than fixing feels earned by what she notices in the fractured gear rather than imported as abstract wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Characters are clearly sketched with distinct roles—Kael’s pragmatism, Lena’s intuition, Anya’s steadiness, Finn’s sensitivity, Elara’s gentle authority—and their collective motivation to save the orchard is coherent and felt. The found-family bond is more often told than freshly dramatized in the present scene, but their coordinated response to Elara’s message effectively embodies it. Internal contradiction is light (Kael’s skepticism vs. remembered trust is the main example), yet it does produce a small but credible internal turn. The emotional cost of Elara’s departure lands, though the family’s individual inner responses could be more particularized for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving her grandmother’s lullaby for all beings—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially as she activates the pane and pours the memory into it. We get effective, embodied glimpses (“tears traced clean paths,” “exhaustion and peace intertwining”) rather than abstract feeling labels. Internal conflict is muted: she feels “bruised awe” and sorrow, but there’s little genuine doubt, temptation to quit, or competing desire in the present to complicate her resolve. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the end of reality while ensuring comfort) feels earned but emotionally low-friction given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s duty-versus-reluctance is clear and consistent—she’s bound by a blood-oath yet longs to flee—and her choices (persisting in the search, assembling, blowing the whistle, deciding to repeat the ritual) align with that motive. However, interiority is relatively spare; we’re told her reluctance more than we feel it grinding against duty in real time. The best moment is “Only then did her shoulders relax,” which hints at embodied cost but doesn’t fully exploit contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s professional lens (polymers, lattices) and emotional state (softened grief, guilt toward Elara) are specific and consistent, and his final decision to reach out is clearly motivated by what he observes. However, his internal conflict stays relatively tidy—he moves from sorrow to resolution without much on-page resistance or contradictory impulse in the present scene. The argument with Elara is summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of relational crucible. The change at the end feels earned but somewhat frictionless for work aiming at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—she wants to locate “the place where stories begin”—and her actions (opening the shop, deciding to incise the stone) align well with that drive. However, there’s little genuine internal contradiction or emotional messiness under pressure; she moves from contemplation to “Resolve crystallized” with minimal friction. The emotional experience of risk in facing the void is more stated than embodied. The arrival of the first customer hints at relational stakes but comes too late to deepen her characterization meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aris’s core motivation—“to sandpaper rough memories”—is vivid and consistent, and his profession-specific discipline (dough, consommé) grounds his interior process. The cost of his gift (contagious emotions) is clearly dramatized when the king’s grief floods him. Internal conflict is present but somewhat underdeveloped: he never seriously wavers or reveals a contradictory impulse beyond strain. The final endurance choice (carrying the smoothed remorse) feels earned but could land harder if his ambivalence or fear had been sharpened earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear, embodied in tactile actions (polishing the weight with rosewater and beeswax, choosing languages for specific gears), and her empathy-driven methodology coheres with the outcome. However, she faces almost no real opposition: she diagnoses the problem quickly, acts competently, and succeeds without visible moral or emotional tradeoff beyond fatigue and tears. Internal contradiction is minimal—her isolation is mentioned late and functions more as thematic backfill than an active struggle that complicates choices in scene. The final stance (renewed commitment to listening and mending) feels earned but not paid for with a sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and history are clear and particular—an engineer abandoning corporate order to excavate “abandoned dreams” is vivid and consistent with her actions. Interiority is concrete in moments (“her body trembled with the magnitude of the connection”), though often summarized at a high level. Internal contradiction (order vs. chaos) is thematically set up but not strongly dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure; she commits fairly smoothly to the new path. The final transformation feels earned but largely untroubled, with limited sense of genuine risk or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained, and the professional texture of "prism-mind" archivist gives her a distinctive way of perceiving the world. However, she encounters minimal live resistance in the grotto, so we see little contradictory impulse or real struggle—her competence dominates without much visible flaw or cost. The earlier failure is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting its psychological bite. The final shift (from seeking to carrying combinations home) feels earned but emotionally under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to coax music from a silent world in an empathetic way—is clear, embodied in her attention to the cracks and her tears as she plays. Interiority is present and particular (“the silence was…a complex, dissonant chord yearning for resolution”) but largely aligned rather than conflicted; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuine risk. Her choices (to use a tool of silence as an instrument, to stop after the final note of “peace”) feel motivated and consistent. The main limitation is the lack of real internal struggle or visible cost beyond effort and cathartic feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and specific: his training as a royal chess tutor, the covenant, the exile, and the worry stone all cohere into a believable inner life. Motivation is clean—fidelity to an ideal over expedience—and his emotional progression from grief to reconfigured acceptance feels earned. The internal conflict between sorrow, integrity, and a desire for beauty under pressure is present, though it could sharpen into a messier contradiction under peak pressure. Still, the final stance—no longer “defined by exile, but by discovery”—is well-motivated by the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is vivid, specific, and embodied—her pacifism, repair of birdwings, and reverent use of the resonator all cohere into a clear, motivated agent. Her obsession with cataloging silences cleanly drives the scene and justifies the emotional risk she takes. The main limitation is a relative lack of internal contradiction or genuine flaw; she reads almost purely virtuous, which slightly flattens the psychological texture. Still, the closing decision to visit Henderson in silence feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s ambition, sensitivity, and desire for “serenity within motion” are clearly established and tracked through concrete acts of care. Her emotional beats—initial awe at the seed, ritualized attention, then tears of “understanding”—feel earned and particular rather than generic. Internal change from conquest to harmony is legible and causally motivated by her routines with the plant. The main limitation is low contradictory pressure on-page; her struggle with the future stench is more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation—saving the western groves—is clear and consistently drives his actions, and his quiet competence as an “orchard pilot” feels specific. However, his inner life remains relatively smooth and unconflicted; the shift from seeker to guardian is thematically apt but emotionally under-complicated. The realization that the source is a covenant rather than a weapon arrives a bit too cleanly, with little sense of resistant impulses or cost. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly layered or combustible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivations are crystal-clear and rooted in a believable professional past, with the flight engineer’s patch providing a strong, particular emotional anchor. His competence and guilt-driven need for “foresight” are dramatized through micro-choices (sensor placement, hypothesis revisions, formal recommendations). The internal shift from burden to “compass” is earned, though his inner conflict runs more as a steady throughline than a sharply contradictory push-pull. A slightly tidier emotional trajectory and some stated beliefs (“He believed disasters were never random…”) keep this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s core motivation—to “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and consistent, and her synesthetic perception gives her a distinct interior lens. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; once the ritual begins, everything proceeds in serene alignment with her goal. Emotional embodiment leans on awe and reverence without much variation or strain beyond “body weary but spirit soaring.” The final stance is earned, but relatively low-cost, which keeps her arc from feeling fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and specific—returning solely “to harvest insights from failure”—and his actions (returning without provisions, arranging markers, playing the flute) all align with that drive. His flaw (pride/control) is dramatized through the vision of his past self ignoring the land’s warnings, and the cost of his new stance (accepting the tear as irreparable) feels earned. Internal conflict between rigid doctrine and emergent humility is present, though the epiphany edges toward being a bit neatly articulated. Overall, he reads like a particular, embodied person rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied, with her borrowed emotions (“sorrow seep into her bones like winter frost”) credibly degrading her sense of self under pressure. Her motivation—understanding the “mathematics of emotion”—drives micro-choices (reaching for constants, embracing ambiguity) and makes the final integration of her own feelings earned. The internal conflict between borrowed personalities and authentic selfhood culminates in a believable shift from fragmentation to harmony. A slight safety lies in how smoothly she reaches serenity once the insight arrives, with limited lingering cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s core motivation (to reclaim wonder amid obligation and grief) is clear, embodied in his jitter vs. the calm at the end, and grounded in concrete gestures like clutching the pendant and kneeling to witness the seed. His relationship to Elara is vivid despite her absence, and his emotional state is reasonably well textured. However, internal conflict is relatively tidy—there’s little sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses during the turn, and his shift from anxiety to serenity comes with minimal resistance. The final stance as “mentor in the making” feels earned but somewhat untroubled, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivation and worldview are sharply drawn—an empiricist mystic seeking proof—and his realization about Mrs. Gable’s peace credibly forces a repricing of his core belief. The internal shift from warm certainty to humbled expansion feels earned by specific perception (the spiral) rather than abstract assertion. However, his contradictions (grounded mystic vs. hungry theorist) remain mostly thematic rather than dramatized in on-page struggle, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—sending a message to a vanished lover—is clear, consistent, and deepens into genuine sacrifice. Her interiority is mostly implied through posture, objects, and choices rather than explicit thought, which works but leaves her a touch archetypal. The latent conflict between clinging to the orchard and offering it up is present but under-dramatized on the micro-choice level. The final endurance/sacrifice reads earned and legible, but with limited contradiction or messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation—devotion to his ruined home and his grandfather’s teaching—is clear and consistent, and the barter of his wife’s laughter gives him a concrete, particular cost. His interiority is gentle and specific, if somewhat idealized; we get little true contradiction or messiness under pressure. The arc from meek blacksmith to quiet guardian is legible and earned by prior choices. The main limitation is that he rarely wavers or behaves irrationally, so his change feels smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and interior arc are clear and specific—her shift from “accusation to compassion” and the re-annotation of the bay as “topography of grace” feel earned. Her vocation as a sensory map maker meaningfully shapes how she perceives everything. Internal conflict is present but mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized under peak pressure, so the pivotal emotional turn reads slightly too smooth. Still, actions align cleanly with motives and the final change in stance carries credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched: taciturn yet fiercely protective, with motives rooted in history and habit, and his micro-choices around the stones feel fully earned. The embodied details—the joints protesting, the feel of sea glass—keep emotion grounded rather than abstract. However, his internal conflict is relatively linear (grief → resolve) with little on-page contradiction or genuine risk of refusal. This slightly limits the depth of complexity expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and particular—quiet, dutiful, almost devotional—and his accidental prophecy functions as a genuine flaw that both causes trouble and enables purpose. The piece shows credible contradictory impulses (fear of laughing vs. exultation in the storm) rather than summarizing them. His endurance at the end—accepting solitude and anonymity while recommitting to the work—reads as earned stasis with a felt cost. The only ceiling is that his inner life stays aligned with his role and duty; we get less sense of non-vocational texture or messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular, with the donor heart, her craft, and Kaela’s memory tightly braided into her motivation. Her micro-choices—waiting for the sun, how she observes the wing, the final decision to “create spaces” rather than collect stories—feel earned by what we’ve seen of her. The internal conflict between taking/possessing and witnessing/offering is clear, if gently drawn. A slight tendency toward abstracted phrasing at the end flattens some of the messier emotional contradiction that could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently rooted in her long-term obsession with what trees witness, and her actions (years of mapping dreams, risking the delicate sextant, lifting it toward the labyrinth) align cleanly with that drive. We get a textured sense of her as methodical, reverent, and emotionally contained, with embodied detail like the grime on her cheek and the gloved hands. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or visible struggle in the present moment—she’s almost too serene under pressure, so the cost of her obsession doesn’t fully bite on the page. Her final evolution into a “listener” is earned but lands more as gentle extension than hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear from the outset (“to rekindle the dying realm”) and her emotional state is embodied via the “shattered loom” mind and the way memories surface through song. The progression from fragmentation to a “mosaic mind” that’s “stronger for its scars” is earned by the ritual and the recollection of her grandmother and village, with a palpable sense of cost and long vigil. Internal conflict is present but subtle—she’s more burdened and uncertain than actively torn—which slightly flattens contradiction under pressure. Still, her micro-choices (which song to recall, persisting in the chant, accepting her role as covenant-keeper) align tightly with motive and produce a credible before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply drawn as a compassionate recluse whose guilt, longing for belonging, and need for safety coexist on the page ("Her method would be staying while leaving"). Her mistake is rooted in a concrete flaw—overextended empathy—and the story shows how that flaw both harms and ultimately matures her. The internal conflict between hiding and returning is active in her choices throughout the ritual. The only limitation is that her emotional shift toward peace happens smoothly, with little on-page resistance at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are vivid and consistent—her noticing, gardening, and attachment to the bread all cohere into a clear inner life. The relationship with Madame Lin is quietly drawn but effective as a crucible for shared grief and care. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; Elara rarely feels pulled between impulses on the page, so her “absolution” costs her little beyond a single tear. The final shift toward resilience feels earned but somewhat gentle and low-friction for the weight the word “absolution” implies.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and motivation are clear and consistently expressed, and her micro-actions (probing deeper into ultraviolet, honoring the transition rather than mourning) align cleanly with those traits. However, she experiences little visible internal contradiction or genuine wobble under pressure; her resolve is almost too unwavering. The result is a compelling but somewhat static interior life, more emblematic than messily human. The final endurance choice (to keep working) feels earned but comes at a mostly conceptual, not sharply felt, personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—the dual vow to keep the truce and capture the sound of trust breaking—and her tactics (false starts, sharp observational logic) align well with that. Her competence under pressure is convincing, but her flaws and genuine blind spots are lightly sketched; she rarely feels in danger of real error. The internal conflict between scientist-observer and guardian is thematically stated more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Still, her final revaluation of what she was seeking feels earned by prior setup rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—testing her grandmother’s “personal weather” as myth or truth—is clear and consistently drives her choices (putting on the ring, entering the stone circle). Her skepticism versus yearning produces a credible inner tension, but that conflict never bites quite hard enough; once she commits to using the ring, the transformation proceeds with little resistance. The emotional embodiment (taste shifts, tears, glow changing from silver to gold) is vivid and character-specific. The final change—doubt dissolving into belief—feels earned, though the cost (relinquishing skepticism) could be shaded with more ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief, guilt, and suppressed artistic drive feel specific and embodied (“charcoal-fingered hands,” the exile from her sketchbooks), and her choice to draw again is clearly motivated by love and loss. Internal conflict between avoiding pain and honoring Lily is present, though largely resolved without much on-page backsliding or self-sabotage. Her final recommitment to drawing reads earned, if a touch tidy emotionally. Lily, though off-page, is vividly evoked through Elara’s perceptions and the note.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—the wilting hands, her compulsion toward truth, and the shift from archivist to “gardener of moments” all feel earned. Her reactions to small confessions (the child, the elder, the neighbor) show her values through micro-choices rather than labels. Internal contradiction (craving a concrete vault of truth vs. discovering its impossibility) is present but kept fairly gentle, so the felt cost is more quiet than searing. Still, the final endurance/renunciation beat—accepting a lifelong, fragile task instead of a tidy solution—is credible and grounded in earlier pages.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory acuity, and quiet devotion are specific and consistent, and her motivation to “preserve the color of wonder” is clear throughout. However, she faces almost no on-page resistance or contradictory impulse; the work feels taxing but never truly fraught. Her seasonal muteness enriches her worldview but does not generate concrete dilemmas in the scene. The ending’s earned stasis (ongoing covenant against apathy) reads credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Unit Seven’s motivation (resolving the “inner static” tied to Lena) is clear and consistently drives every choice, and the caretaker role feels specific and lived-in. The promise to “keep it safe” pays off nicely against the later decision to burn the contents. However, interior conflict is relatively low-friction—the choice to perform the ritual is accepted almost immediately, with little felt ambivalence about destroying Lena’s entrusted objects. Emotional language leans a bit abstract (“fragmented wholeness,” “inner static”) rather than fully embodied in a few key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and guiding trait (“patient following”) are clear and consistently dramatized through her choices to listen rather than pry. Interiority is present but light; she rarely experiences true contradiction or strain, so her arc resolves more as validation than transformation. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently with distinct emotional weights (Mrs. Gupta’s tenderness, Mr. Henderson’s guilt). The final reassurance to Mr. Henderson is thematically apt but emotionally tidy, smoothing over potential moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength") is clear, consistent, and beautifully mirrored in her actions, especially dancing through frustration to insight and choosing to send a survival message for others as well as herself. Her internal shifts—from haunted and tense to calm, purposeful defiance—feel earned by the decoding process. There is some tidiness in the late-stage clarity ("Clarity bloomed") and the articulated wisdom that leans a bit toward thesis, slightly smoothing over potential contradictions or darker edges. Overall, she reads as specific, embodied, and agentive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—rooted in the locket and her sister—so her actions track cleanly from that desire, and the final act of sealing the flowers feels earned. Her embodied emotion (calloused fingers, tears through salt dust) is concrete and mostly avoids generic feeling-labels. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradiction; she moves from resolve to fulfillment with minimal doubt or competing impulses. This smoothness keeps the character from reaching a more complex, pressure-tested depth.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—she comes to hush a harmful prophecy—and her actions track cleanly with that goal. Interiority is sensorially rich and character-specific, especially around her focus and compassion. However, she experiences almost no on-page doubt, competing impulse, or visible struggle, so the internal arc feels more like steady competence than pressured change. The cost (losing the wing, accepting solitude) is present but understated emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her shift from “interrogating stone” to “listening with compassion” is legible and earned. However, her internal conflict remains relatively smooth—there’s little real resistance or contradictory impulse on the page, so the change feels insightful but low-cost. Mrs. Davison is warmly drawn yet mostly occupies a wise-mentor role without much complication. The emotional beats land, but they could use one sharper moment of friction or misstep to deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent—she wants to alchemize quarantined grief into independence—and her actions (performing Kael’s ritual despite prior skepticism) align cleanly with that drive. Her interiority is embodied and particular (“vibrated in her bones,” the feel of moss, the smell of damp earth), not generic. The arc from “charmed skeptic” to someone who trusts a method she once dismissed reads earned, though the emotional resolution borders on tidy (“The weight of isolation dissolved”), trimming some ambiguity. Internal contradiction (skeptic vs. believer, fear of pain vs. desire for integration) is present but could be dramatized with a touch more friction in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s guilt, love for Elian, and long-term endurance are clearly motivated and consistent, and the past choice (altering the treaty) credibly drives the present ritual. The calligrapher/forger detail informs both his history and his precise actions with the thorn and key. However, in the climactic sequence his inner conflict loosens without much resistance; once the ritual begins, forgiveness arrives almost too smoothly, with few contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment. The change feels earned by backstory but slightly under-pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand why some echoes persist—is clear, consistent, and credibly tied to her fifty years of listening, and her final act of singing for release grows organically from that. Embodied emotion shows well in details like the seashell burning her palm and tears cutting tracks through dust. However, she faces little internal contradiction or genuine dilemma; once the shell speaks, she moves in a straight line toward a foregone role as healer. The change at the end feels more like confirmation of who she already is than a costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”—and her actions (entering Lena’s dreamscape, choosing to write to Eleanor via Lena) align with that. Interiority is present and specific, with nice embodied touches like the tear freezing, but she is almost entirely saintly, with little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. Her final choice to share the truth is emotionally coherent but not visibly costly or conflicted. Overall, she reads vivid but somewhat idealized, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The net-mender philosopher’s motivation—to honor hidden effort—is clear, consistent, and drives his concrete choices (mending the net, performing the tea ritual, daring the whistle). His interiority is specific and sensorial rather than generic, and his craft-based worldview feels individual. However, he experiences little true internal contradiction or friction; the piece largely confirms his existing philosophy rather than testing it. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, closer to deepened affirmation than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation as a lifelong conspiracy debunker is clear and drives every choice, and her shift to guardian feels earned by the accumulation of evidence and moral pressure. The internal conflict at the end—betraying her professional identity to protect the orchard—is strong, though it leans more on articulated realization than deeply embodied turmoil. Her competence and sharp observation are well dramatized (e.g., noticing the moss depression), avoiding stock “smart protagonist” gestures. A touch more visceral hesitation or fear at the renunciation moment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives (lonely, patient, shadow-guided resistance to Kael’s doctrine) are clear and consistent, and her endurance over “decades of solitude” gives the final emotional turn credible weight. Her interiority is more stated than dramatized under pressure, so contradictory impulses (doubt, fear, anger) don’t quite surface in-scene. Secondary characters—Hemlock, Valerius, Lena—are efficiently sketched with distinct allegiances and tensions that sharpen the stakes of her broadcasts. The closing shift from isolation to connection (“no longer isolated, but woven into the tapestry”) feels earned but emotionally streamlined rather than fully knotted and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The poet’s motivation (atonement and intergenerational translation) is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in his choices around the music box and jars. His emotions feel grounded in concrete acts (cleaning gears, etching “For Elara,” tears through dust) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction stays soft; regret and hope co-exist but never clash in a way that forces a difficult choice. The change from fugitive to “keeper of echoes” is resonant but arrives with minimal on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and role are sharply defined, and her “logically emotional” nature is convincingly dramatized in how she diagnoses the crisis and responds through both technical analysis and empathic listening. Interiority is concrete and tied to body and environment (“pressure behind her eyes, a jagged vibration tightening her chest”). However, her internal conflict is relatively mild—she never seems genuinely torn or at risk of failure—so her final composure feels earned but not hard-won. The endurance and care pay off, but with limited visible cost beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is nuanced, with impatience “humming like a trapped bird” against her chosen role as keeper of a “patient revolution.” Her motives (unyoking her people from haste) are clear and consistently tied to specific actions (the vigil, the mapping, the ritual). The final transformation—her impatience dissolving into “abiding patience”—is earned by the long set-up of seven winters and the on-page tension of waiting for this alignment. At times, motivation is stated a bit abstractly rather than always dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s professional role, personal history with the society, and present-tense choices integrate well, and her motivation to expose the society is clear and consistent. The practiced “watchful calm” reads as a genuine discipline rather than a label, and her decision to turn the lantern into evidence feels earned. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; we’re told about emotional turbulence more than we see competing impulses destabilize her in-scene. The final resolve lands, but with relatively low visible cost or inner struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, vocation, and need to redeem his failure with Samuel clearly drive his choices, and his interiority is specific and embodied (the box as “sacred relic,” tears cutting through dust). The arc from debt-driven apology to action-oriented grace is motivated and legible. Internal conflict—shame vs. duty—is present, though the resolution edges toward tidy clarity. Horvath functions effectively as a foil whose stance pressures Elias without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and specific—"to ring a bell no one hears yet"—and her irreverent awe toward the Algorithm gives her a strong, particular flavor. We see competence and persistence over "oil-stained triumphs and spectacular failures," but almost no on-page contradiction or serious doubt, so internal conflict is thin. The final shift is more a confirmation of her existing worldview than a new stance, which slightly blunts the sense of arc. Nonetheless, her choices clearly flow from who she is and feel earned by the history implied.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (curiosity, suspicion about “deleted” files, reverence for truth) is clear and consistently drives her choices, culminating in the lie-as-guardianship decision. Her interiority is specific enough to feel individual—“brightly attentive” and drawn to patterns—but her internal conflict around lying remains mostly stated rather than deeply dramatized. Emotion is often summarized (“Tears traced Elara’s cheeks”) instead of complicated or embodied in more idiosyncratic ways. Director Vance is a functional foil, not a fully realized presence, which keeps the relational pressure a bit thin.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The peacekeeper’s motivation—“to map empathy onto action”—is clear, consistent, and carried through their choices with some specificity. However, interior conflict is muted: there’s little sense of competing impulses (fear vs. duty, doubt vs. resolve) in the moment, so courage reads more as stated attribute than dramatized struggle. The anomaly is framed more as role than as a fully individuated psyche, so the figure remains slightly archetypal. The final stance (choosing to mend rather than flee) is thematically coherent but would land harder with more embodied doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is rich and specific: her euthanasia-tourist status, tactile anchoring in the net and parasol tip, and reorientation toward community all feel internally consistent. Motivation—to hear/understand endings—clearly informs what she pays attention to. However, her decision to keep the clinic appointment after such a profound experience reads a touch under-dramatized; the internal conflict could sharpen more overtly on the page. The relationship with Lars is suggestive but lightly sketched, functioning more as catalyst than true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara, Clara, and Liam all have clear, consistent motives, and their specific memories (his vigil, her roses) give the relationship texture beyond archetype. Elara’s prior heartbreak grounds her role so she isn’t just a wise facilitator. However, some emotions and insights are articulated in slightly abstract, therapeutic language (“armor my fear in criticism,” “intersubjective understanding”) rather than fully embodied contradiction in the moment. The reconciliation feels earned but slightly smoothed-over, with little genuine resistance or mess as they shift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, specific, and carried consistently: reverent duty to preserve the echo without distortion. His creed (half-mask, revelation/restraint) and “strangely honest” nature feel particular rather than generic. Emotional life is mostly conveyed through posture and sensory focus, with a few embodied details (aching joints, single tear) giving him weight. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under pressure remains muted, so his final stance feels deepened rather than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and Liam’s brief arc from inherited bitterness to softened understanding is legible and plausible. However, Elara verges on saintly—her lack of visible flaw or internal contradiction under pressure flattens potential depth. Most emotions are conveyed cleanly but often through smooth progression rather than conflicted impulses. The final “completion” of her work reads earned but emotionally low-cost because we never see her seriously strained or doubting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation and interiority are clear and consistent, and his final act—restoring the crystal and leaving the library—follows credibly from his long devotion to decoding “growth.” The embodied details (tears cutting through dust, the worn leather chair, the cold teacup left as offering) give him specificity. However, his inner life is largely single-note—reverent, patient, already resigned—so we see little active contradiction or real struggle in the moment of choice. The change feels more like a serene completion than a pressured trade-off, which slightly softens the impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are vivid and particular—the junkyard prophet clinging to sensory “echoes” is sharply rendered, and her ritual with driftwood and chalk grows organically from her flaw of precognitive forgetfulness. The emotional cost of her condition is embodied in specific memories (the grandfather, the tapes, the chair) rather than labels. What keeps this short of the very top tier is that her internal conflict rarely manifests as active contradiction in the moment—she mainly enacts a single, unwavering drive rather than suffering visibly competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s competence, long history with repair, and drive to “harness the ephemeral” are clearly and consistently motivated, and her calm under pressure feels particular rather than generic. The bonsai leaf insight and her choice to treat the clock with “compassion over conquest” arise credibly from her characterization. Internal conflict is present but muted—she moves from disturbance to solution with little felt doubt or risk of failure, which keeps her arc from reaching truly searing depth. The emotional payoff at the end (“luminous ache,” memory of Aris) is earned, but not sharply double-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arthur, Lena, and Elara are all clearly motivated and emotionally legible, with Elara’s mission and Lena’s grief particularly well-drawn. The relationship pressure between father and daughter is quiet but effective, culminating in the shared grasp of the shard. However, interior contradiction is underplayed—everyone behaves with near-ideal emotional clarity, which flattens potential complexity. The characters feel real but a touch too serene for the extremity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to solve the noon-shadow mystery and mend reality) is clear and consistent, and her patience/precision are well dramatized. However, she faces little genuine internal conflict or moral ambiguity; she is almost uniformly competent and composed. The final sense of peace is earned but comes without a strongly felt personal cost or renunciation. Characterization is solid and specific but not yet at a level of piercing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded—her blend of clinical skepticism and maternal grief feels lived-in, and her profession informs how she frames every realization. However, her internal struggle resolves a bit too smoothly once the tooth’s flaw is noticed; contradictory impulses don’t fully clash on the page. The forgiveness toward the villagers is asserted more than tested by any concrete interaction in-scene. The final stance is credible but feels slightly preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—creating fireless light for Liam—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her actions. Her embodied limitation (the injured knee) nicely ties into her "earthbound" identity and eventual reframing of purpose. However, internal conflict stays relatively soft; there’s little sense of competing impulses or live doubt once she begins polishing. The final realization feels earned but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—seeking an active, self-designed healing ritual rather than passively enduring online outrage—and her final renunciation (leaving the pendant) is well earned by prior interiority. The piece shows her flaw (envy, shame) without over-justifying it, and small choices (entering, unclasping, burying) reveal a value hierarchy. However, some emotional language leans toward label/therapy-speak (“quietly proactive in her healing,” “protected vulnerability”) rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The inner conflict between her attachment to the pendant/Lena and her need to let it go could be slightly more dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation and conflict (industry nihilism vs. integrity and hope) are clear and consistent, and his method with the seashell gives him a particular psychology. However, interiority leans conceptual—“current of nihilism,” “professional pressures”—more than embodied and contradictory feeling in the body. We see his values but not many messy impulses or irrational lurches under pressure. The final peace feels earned but emotionally smoothed rather than sharply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation and history (thirty years of reconstruction) are clear and specific, and her actions align cleanly with that drive. However, she moves through the ritual with almost no internal contradiction, fear, or misgiving, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The main “cost” is retrospective (time spent, aching joints) rather than dramatized in the scene as an active emotional struggle. This keeps the characterization solid but short of the depth and friction expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to counter her life of beautiful vanishing by safekeeping starlight—is clear, specific, and enacted through concrete choices (the pattern-making, the blood-drop, the hand on the tree). Her interiority is largely embodied and filtered through work rather than abstract self-analysis. Internal contradiction (ephemeral craft vs permanent map) is present but remains conceptual; it never quite sharpens into an on-page dilemma that costs her more than blood and fatigue. The closing sense of unburdening feels earned but could deepen if a prior, riskier alternative (to burn, to abandon, to accept decay) had been more explicitly live.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, particular, and tied to his profession and worldview, and his actions consistently align with that quiet conviction. However, internal contradiction and emotional texture are relatively muted; he operates with near-frictionless competence. There’s little sense of real struggle or competing impulses as he works, which limits the depth of his arc. The closing sense of “inner warmth” is earned but feels small-scale and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, history (the childhood pebble), and present choice are clearly motivated and particular, and her craft is tightly tied to her psychology. The embodied detail of tools and process grounds her interiority. Internal contradiction—her compassion versus her isolating role—is present but only lightly dramatized, so the cost of her endurance at the end could bite harder. Her final stance feels earned but largely untested by genuine risk or failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s grief, craft, and “hauntingly practical” nature are rendered with concrete, character-specific behavior (the kettle ritual, the ash wood, Leo’s cup), and her motivation to transform sorrow into artifacts is clear and consistent. Her interiority is embodied and particular—pipe tobacco, specific lions, the scar on her wrist—rather than generic lament. The closing sense of earned endurance (“she knew she was not merely enduring. She was actively, purposefully harvesting.”) feels motivated by what we’ve seen. The one limitation is that her conflict remains mostly resolved within a single, stable stance; contradictory impulses under pressure could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—negotiating with her younger, idealistic self—is clear and coherent, and her scavenger pragmatism plays well against her buried ambition. Interiority is specific in places (“chronologically confused from decades in time-thin places”) and her micro-choices (turning the wheel, approaching the ghost, offering the gear as understanding rather than attack) feel motivated. The integration moment is emotionally earned, though her emotional conflict sometimes drifts into abstract summary (“regret was the action weighting her steps”) instead of fully embodied contradiction. The final acceptance is a touch tidy but still credible as a culmination of the established regret.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and nicely embodied in her methodical, almost reverent labor, and her quiet, stoic awe at the end feels specific rather than generic. However, she is largely unconflicted: the piece gives her no real opposing impulse or moral friction, so her internal life reads as single-note. The final “equation for hope” is thematically neat but costs her nothing and doesn’t reveal a flaw or blind spot. Overall, she’s vivid and coherent but a bit idealized and low-conflict for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her history with the tuning fork, the bodily tremor of her hands, and the way she moves through the forecourt all feel character-particular. Her motivation (to reconcile with an abandoned dream) is clear and consistently drives each micro-choice. The final renunciation—leaving the fork in the crystal—is earned by the preceding emotional progression and carries visible cost. The only slight weakness is how smoothly the insight arrives; the conflict resolves a bit cleanly for the depth of regret implied.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to salvage her integrity by understanding the deception—remains clear, consistent, and drives every on-page choice, culminating in her renunciation of vengeance. Interiority is specific (radio silence, canal, sundial textures) and embodied, not generic. The shift from “errant legend seeker” to “guardian of authenticity” feels earned by what she pieces together. Internal contradiction (hurt versus composure, desire for justice versus refusal of vengeance) is present but voiced in fairly tidy terms rather than messier, more conflicted textures.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, patience, and quiet urgency are clear and consistent, and her decoding of the rope is a well-motivated, character-specific action. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction; she moves serenely from intention to fulfillment. The fisherman’s trust is nicely sketched but not deeply stressed or tested. The closing shift (“the true treasure”) feels more like a deepening of an existing stance than a pressured change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, particular, and consistent—her vocation and desire “to understand the geography of healing” drive every choice. Her emotional responses are embodied and specific (tears, tactile focus on the thread), and the brief exchange with Kael effectively reveals values and status without over-explaining. However, internal conflict remains relatively gentle and uncontradicted; she never seriously wavers, so the final shift feels like deepening rather than a hard-won reversal. The cost—tears and new responsibility—is present but could register more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is clear, consistent, and credibly intensified by thirty years of solitude, with his shift from seeking resurrection to accepting requiem feeling earned. Interiority is conveyed through his meticulous preparations and his theorizing about “flawed genesis,” which shows an active, conflicted mind rather than stock emotion. His final choice to descend “with a story” instead of a miracle forecloses the fantasy of full restoration at a visible emotional cost. There could, however, be slightly more in-the-moment contradiction under peak pressure to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and anchored in a credible contradiction between shame and compassion toward her father. Her motivation as “the arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter” is clear and consistently enacted through the ritual. The memory of grafting with her father sharpens this conflict and makes her choice to honor him instead of disavowing him feel earned. The main limitation is that external pressure is minimal, so her struggle never quite feels tested beyond a controlled, reflective space.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—freeing the trapped memories before dawn—and her “luminous skepticism” versus quiet hope gives her interiority texture. Her doubt (“fool’s errand”) and gradual softening into “steadfast knowing” feel earned by the verification of each clue. The emotional embodiment is mostly through externalized perception and a few tears rather than deeply variegated bodily experience, which keeps her arc a touch cool. Still, her choices at each fountain and her final role as “keeper” create a credible, if understated, change.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation and emotional burden are clear and consistent, and her devotion to fireless light is convincingly rooted in family history. Interiority is specific (the feel of ancestral echoes in the gas, the daughter learning sonar), and her reverence toward the gear individualizes her. However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction under pressure; doubt, fear, and devotion do not truly clash in a live decision. The final acceptance feels earned but relatively low-cost because she is never forced into a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is vividly realized—her scars, craft, and contemplative temperament all feel specific, and her motivation to honor collective grief is clear and consistent. Her micro-choices (entering the greenhouse, accepting Lyra’s command, deciding on the memorial’s form) track cleanly from that core. The main limitation is that her internal struggle runs relatively smooth; there’s little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse once the reflection begins, so the final decision carries modest visible cost. Lyra is effective but functions primarily as a benevolent guide rather than a source of real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivations—duty to the clock, inherited guilt, desire to restore balance—are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (climbing, cleaning, making the “microscopic adjustment”) all align. However, she faces little visible internal contradiction or resistance; she mostly enacts a stable virtue rather than wrestling with a live flaw. The reverie with her grandfather’s inscriptions does deepen her sense of legacy in a character-particular way. The final “inscription” she imagines for herself feels earned but carries modest, mostly conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her occupation and methods are well-integrated with her goal of decoding Albright’s intentions. However, she remains almost entirely unconflicted—her “blithe spirit” never seriously collides with doubt, fear, or resistance—so we see little in the way of contradictory impulses under pressure. Her emotional journey from curiosity to gentle understanding feels smooth and somewhat pre-ordained, with limited visible cost. The lack of a sharper inner struggle keeps an otherwise strong characterization out of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to catalyze a specific, plausible transformation for her people—is clear, consistent, and rooted in her vocation and methods. The internal conflict between rigorous doubt and informed hope is credible and resolved through disciplined re-checking of data rather than a cheap epiphany. However, she remains somewhat idealized; her flaws and potential blind spots are gestured at (“What if a variable was missed?”) but never allowed to complicate her character in a way that exacts visible cost. The final stance—calm certainty—feels earned but not deeply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s vocation, compulsion, and grief over the “story famine” are vivid and specific, and her motivation to rescue narratives is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices (tuning, cloaking the radio, meticulous transcription). The internal tension between fear of discovery and the need to listen is present but could sharpen into a more explicit, in-scene contradiction of impulses. Her redefinition from “copyist” to “gardener of ghosts” feels earned by the accumulated behavior. The emotional life is embodied (pulse, flinch, sensory focus) rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role, vocation, and motivation are clear and specific, and her actions all follow convincingly from that ritualistic purpose. However, she remains almost entirely in the “priestess of vulnerability” register—there’s little contradiction, doubt, or genuine friction within her, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully three-dimensional. The realization about “true safety” lands more as a smooth affirmation than a hard-won, messy cost. The grandmother stays a symbolic presence rather than a psychologically particular individual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motives and worldview are sharply defined, with his archivist-compulsive rationalism driving every choice. The internal dilemma over revealing or hiding the tablet reads credibly as a clash between rebellion and caution. However, emotion is sometimes over-labeled rather than embodied (“His motivation was crystalline”), which slightly flattens complexity. The final acceptance of his role as “custodian” feels earned but not deeply surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to braid divided voices into harmony) is clear and consistently embodied in her choices, especially her decision to "subtract noise" rather than confront hatred head-on. The emotional arc for Liam and Anya is sketched efficiently, with their humming, non-smirk, and final exchange giving their change weight. However, Elara borders on saintly, with limited contradiction or visible flaw under pressure, so her interior conflict remains relatively gentle. The shift from "expectantly resigned" to "quiet awe" is earned but emotionally smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arlo’s motivation—to “create something beautiful from these ruins”—is clear and consistent, and his gift is meaningfully dramatized through each snip and taste. However, he’s rendered as almost wholly noble and wise, with little contradiction or real flaw, which flattens his complexity. The emotional beats (tears, reverence, quiet rebellion) are embodied but rarely surprising. The final shift toward “planting the past wisely” feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s characterization is specific and coherent—his involuntary truthfulness, long service, and devotion to “preserving wonder” all read vividly, and his choice to reveal the truth via the inherited riddle fits his values. However, his internal life under pressure is relatively simple: there’s little simultaneous pull between duty, fear, and wonder, so his final satisfaction costs him nothing visible. Dr. Aris functions well as a pressure-bearing secondary but is mostly a foil for exposition and thematic realization. The endurance/renunciation at the end feels more like affirmation of a stable self than a change that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to understand why some houses feel "alive"—is clear, consistent, and concretely enacted through her walk, observations, and ritual with the shard. Interiority is particular (her attention to porch steps, ivy, light) and emotions are embodied in the hush and tears. However, internal contradiction is muted; she moves toward a revelation with relatively little resistance or competing impulse. The closing shift in her motivation (from seeking answers to witnessing) is credible but arrives a bit smoothly, without a sharply felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motive—compassionate correction of rigid certainty—is clear and consistent, and his key choice (to use the ampoule on the fracture and distribute its effects gently) aligns with that. However, he experiences little visible internal contradiction or struggle; he functions more as an instrument of theme than a fully pressured character. Emotional embodiment tends toward abstracted “incisive kindness” rather than idiosyncratic, character-specific feeling. The closing softening of his own certainty is resonant but arrives without much prior resistance to overcome, which limits the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to mathematically capture the texture of a single missed moment—feels specific, consistent, and governs every choice, especially her refusal to step through the rupture. Her interiority is rich and character-particular (theorems, limits, calculus) rather than generic regret. The endurance ending (remaining on the staircase with a new stance) is earned by prior obsession and work, and the cost of not leaving is clear. The only slight limitation is that decades of struggle are summarized rather than dramatized in discrete pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation, ritual, and insomnia are tightly aligned and her emotional responses (to the remembered kindness and the nurse’s note) feel specific and embodied. However, she reads almost entirely as an idealized figure of ethical persistence, with little visible internal contradiction or cost beyond sleeplessness. The micro-choices (what memory to paint, whether to leave the painting and observe) do reveal values but never pit those values against a serious competing impulse. The resulting arc is convincingly sketched but emotionally safe for elite-level short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (“to rescue dying arts”) is clear and consistently expressed through her attention to carvings and insistence on baking that night, and Old Man Hemlock’s grief-to-resolve turn is clean. However, Elara herself never faces a truly difficult trade-off or visible cost; she is largely a catalytic facilitator whose internal conflict (between dread and hope) remains relatively tidy. The elders’ rigidity and the community’s despair are sketched rather than dramatized through resistance, which softens the crucible around her choices. The emotional embodiment is good but not deeply contradictory or risky enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and professional identity are vivid and specific—the “counter-clockwise clock maker” with a long-term rebellion against fate is an excellent core. Her emotional life is mostly filtered through elevated diction rather than messy, contradictory impulses in the moment, so we get less friction between doubt and resolve than this premise could bear. Her final peace feels earned conceptually, but the cost is largely abstract; we don’t see meaningful risk of failure or sacrifice beyond effort and grim history. The characterization is strong and coherent, but not yet as complex or internally conflicted as top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The advisor’s motivation—to trick fear into revealing its weakness—is clear, consistent, and drives each choice, especially his use of the dream dictionary and his offer of “cursed emptiness” as bait. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; he reads more as an already-formed specialist executing a plan than as a man wrestling with competing impulses under pressure. His emotional state is mostly conveyed through atmosphere rather than specific, embodied contradiction. The change at the end (regaining a reflection, relinquishing the clasp) is earned and legible, though its cost feels more conceptual than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leeward’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in personal history, and his actions consistently express his vow to make obstacles into instruments. However, he experiences very little visible doubt, fear, or inner contradiction even as the storm escalates, which keeps his interiority from feeling fully pressured. The final peace is satisfying but relatively cost-light; nothing in him has to be relinquished or compromised. This reads as a strong, coherent character rather than a deeply conflicted one.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent, and her methodical, pattern-obsessed mind gives her a distinct interior texture. The survivor guilt and link to the lost expedition add depth, but her internal conflict is relatively low-friction—she rarely hesitates or contradicts herself under pressure. Her key choices (interpreting the crack, deciding to play, stepping through) all track cleanly with her established nature. What holds this just below the very top tier is the relative smoothness of her emotional journey; there’s little on-page ambivalence or real temptation to stay safe.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris is clearly motivated and coherent as a historian who is both ethical and compassionate, and his method (drawing parallels) is nicely character-specific. However, internal conflict is muted: he feels "bittersweet" sorrow, but there's little dramatized resistance or temptation to maintain the lie, so his arc is more affirmation than transformation. The "emotionally rational" label is supported by behavior, but the lack of sharp contradiction under pressure keeps this short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, ritual, and emotional posture are very clear and consistent, and his motivation (archaeologist of abandoned dreams) convincingly drives every choice. His stoic sensitivity reads on the page in embodied ways—the careful handling of stones, the ink-blurred final note—but internal contradiction is only lightly implied rather than dramatically tested. There’s some weight-of-stories vs. steady resolve tension, yet it never forces a fraught decision. The ending’s endurance of his task feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (“to verify whether the celebrated Founders’ Charter documented true inception or deliberate erasure”) is clear, consistent, and appropriately scaled to the scene. Her perception-driven interiority feels specific to a meticulous archivist, though genuine internal conflict or moral ambiguity is minimal and largely implied rather than dramatized. The final “quiet victory” and sense of carrying a “quiet compass” show a believable, earned internal shift, but the cost of her choice is more conceptual than felt. A touch more friction—fear of discovery, doubt, or loyalty conflict—would deepen her beyond an almost idealized truth-seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief, craft-obsession, and quiet determination are sharply drawn, with concrete actions (polishing, chanting, folding) that align cleanly to her motive of managing loss. The metaphor of being “halved, a portrait missing its negative” feels character-specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction is present but relatively low-key—she’s hollow yet methodical, but we don’t see many moments where impulses truly clash on the page. The final recommitment to folding reads earned, but an external pressure or relational friction could have deepened her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—trauma-driven but intellectually reframed as a hunt for “where unused potential pools,” which feels specific to her fusion of physics and grief. Her interiority is embodied (scarred fingers, bone-deep pressure, tears through dust) and her arc from fixation on loss to a new, costly stance toward the future is legible. The main limitation is how smoothly the epiphanic shift arrives; internal contradiction (wanting answers vs fearing what they show) is more implied than dramatized in live conflict. The result is moving but slightly tidy for the level of realization she reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (“decode the frequency of belonging”) is clear and consistently tied to his choices, and his competence with drones and navigation reads specific and grounded. However, his internal conflict is under-pressured; he moves from focused loner to emotionally fulfilled with little dramatized resistance or contradiction. Elara’s “perpetually surprised” trait remains one-note and mostly decorative, though her wonder does soften him in a credible way. The final emotional shift feels earned enough for this length but could use one sharper moment of hesitation or fear to deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt, professional history, and specific misdeed toward Elara are clear and coherent, and his ultimate decision to tell the truth feels causally earned by what we see. His interiority is particular (black market genealogist, ritual with driftwood), and his flaw—overprotective deceit—directly shapes the harm. The shift from self-justifying “easing burdens” to recognizing that he “stolen her right to mourn” lands as a credible reorientation. Internal contradiction could be embodied more in-scene (moment-to-moment vacillation) rather than mostly explained as retrospective realization.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s guilt over Veridian Pass, his vow to “recycle mistakes into wisdom,” and his ritual with the drawer pull create a coherent, specific inner life. His actions (championing the moon-signal method, handling the exchange with grave care) align cleanly with that psychology. However, we rarely feel contradictory impulses in real time—he is almost too serenely self-aware for the stakes—and the relationship with Kaela remains underdeveloped beyond mirrored resolve. The change at the end (from burdened guilt to steadier wisdom) is credible but emotionally muted rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlo’s interiority is specific and embodied—his penance via utility poles, his aversion to looking up, and the compass’s weight as shame all feel character-particular. The internal contradiction between love of the stars and self-punishing distrust is active in scene and culminates credibly when he chooses to use the compass again. The shift from “broken navigator” in flight from his craft to a man who accepts both scar and calling feels earned rather than convenient. The only slight limitation is how smoothly the epiphany arrives once he looks up; the beat could bear a hair more resistance or self-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is sharply defined from the outset and his inner life feels particular—clean-slate emptiness, weaponized discernment, and the physical tremor give him specificity. His arc from numbness to painful empathy is earned through concrete beats (newspapers, tunnels, the lake) rather than pure declaration. The main weakness is that the final emotional turn borders on smooth revelation rather than a truly messy, contradictory internal struggle, especially once the lake "accepts" his act without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation to reforge the bond with Kael is clear and consistent, and the tension between her love for him and fear of losing the self he loved (“a reluctant metamorphosis she feared would erase the very self he loved”) gives her interiority weight. Her emotions are embodied (breath, tears, chest pressure) and her competence as a beast whisperer complicates the sacrifice. The final transformation feels earned by the established willingness to pay a real price. A touch more idiosyncratic, less abstract emotional language could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and felt from the first paragraph, and her interiority is rich and grounded in concrete images (labor hours, the cracked saucer, the locket). The contradiction between her need to control time and her “willing perplexity” gives her a genuine internal conflict. Her final stance—consecrating the crack and releasing guilt—feels earned by the ritual we’ve watched her undertake. The only limitation is how smoothly resolved her emotional state becomes; the ending skirts a slightly too-tidy serenity for such a profound psychic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—compassionate resurrection of life—is clear and consistently embodied, and her interior process during the ritual feels specific rather than generic. The tension between her loneliness, survivor’s guilt, and chosen pacifism gives her enough texture for this length. However, her goodness is somewhat idealized, with little in the way of genuine moral mess or self-deception under pressure. The final transformation feels earned, but the arc would gain from one sharper moment where her values are truly at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motive (to understand “the texture of transformation”) is clear and coherently expressed through her final relinquishing of the jars, and her past as a “destitute philanthropist” gives her a distinct moral profile. However, her internal conflict at the key moment—the cost of giving up her only treasure—remains more asserted than dramatized; she never truly wavers or contradicts herself on the page. The philanthropy via “small kindnesses” is summarized rather than embodied in scene, which slightly flattens her complexity. Still, the final renunciation is earned and aligned with what we know of her.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent—his calmly inventive nature, duty role, and revolutionary intent align well with his choices. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; he rarely feels genuinely torn between his oath and his subversion, which flattens emotional stakes. Embodied emotion is mostly implied through careful, controlled action rather than visceral contradiction. The final endurance—standing as sentinel after betraying the system—lands as an Earned Stasis, but with only a light sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives—honoring Kael’s promise, alleviating the world’s “slide,” and pursuing understanding—are clear and consistent, and her eel-herder past grounds her in specific vocation. The precognitive “curse” and villagers’ fear add texture but rarely force sharply contradictory impulses in the moment; her choice to proceed with the ritual never feels genuinely in doubt. Her embodied response to restored friction (“fell to her knees,” feeling grit) is vivid and particular. The final re-identification from eel herder to “pattern keeper” reads earned but emotionally smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior life is coherent and specific—“furiously tranquil” posture, the visceral reaction to the letter, and the eventual steady hand with the pen all track a believable emotional progression. Her motivation (to understand the “cartography of scars”) is clear and consistently refracted through objects and choices. The key turn from frozen vigil to active writing feels earned by the mentor’s letter and her breakdown. Some of the insight is articulated in thesis-like abstractions rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment, which mutes complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (“to turn questions into destinations”) is clear and consistently embodied in her patient, methodical decoding. Her competence and calm under pressure are well drawn, but internal conflict is minimal—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or risk to her identity. The mechanical arm and philosophical vocation are nicely integrated into her perception and tactics. The final shift from waiting to active preparation is believable but comes without a strong felt cost or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific—her fear of the molt undercuts her professed commitment to “alchemy,” giving her a real internal contradiction. The personas concept feels integrated rather than gimmicky, and her shift from Silas’s hardness toward a “persona of roots and whispers” reads earned. Her micro-choices (voicing doubt, accepting the seed, kneeling to plant it) track cleanly with this fear/desire tension. Kael is a bit idealized and functions more as wise support than a fully pressured character, which slightly limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s longing and grief are specific and embodied through her relationship to the clock, the piano, and Leo’s film, and her goal is consistent and clearly motivated. Her agency drives every major beat, from decoding the reel to choosing to play the anniversary duet. What’s missing at a top-tier level is more present-tense contradiction—she rarely feels genuinely torn or self-sabotaging under pressure, so her arc reads clean rather than complex. The final shift to “twilight resilience” is earned, but not hard-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent from the first paragraph, and her internal tension between empirical verification and dream-faith is dramatized rather than merely labeled. The shift from “empirically whimsical” skeptic to guardian who accepts doubt as compass feels earned through the sensory onslaught of collective memory. Her emotions are mostly embodied (calloused fingers, heavy air, sensory flood) rather than abstracted. The only slight limitation is that the inner conflict resolves a bit tidily into articulated wisdom at the end, trimming some messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is precise and particular—“to find the color of unspoken apologies”—and it cleanly governs every beat. His calm-bonsai-tutor persona sits against deep grief in a way that feels specific rather than generic, and his actions (choosing to activate the compass, how he witnesses the memory) align with that. Internal conflict is present but relatively gentle; there’s not a strong sense of him resisting or sabotaging himself in the moment, which keeps the arc slightly safer than it could be. The final endurance/acceptance feels earned, with a visible cost in his tears and the lingering severance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist's progression from detachment to humility relies on summarized internal states rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The realization beat falls into diagnostic label-speak ("his own frantic need to control meaning") rather than embodied emotion, reducing the character to a vessel for the theme. The attribute "preprocesses reality" functions as a stated label rather than a constraint that forces difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("embodied her core attribute," "narrative of human consequence") rather than demonstrated action. The protagonist's resilience is asserted through adjectives rather than earned through a difficult, high-stakes choice in the moment. The internal state feels curated and abstract, lacking raw, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a benevolent archetype rather than a complex agent; her "steady warmth" never wavers, reducing the struggle. Liam is a prop for the protagonist's ability, lacking agency or distinct interiority beyond his role as a trauma vessel. The emotional arc is smooth and devoid of the friction required for genuine character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with clear agency, but his motivation is delivered via summary ("His motivation was a quiet vow") rather than dramatized friction. The "stubborn" trait feels like a narrative label used to smooth over the protocol breach quickly rather than a source of genuine internal conflict or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elara is portrayed as an idealized, purely noble figure without internal contradiction or grit; her "gently persistent" nature is stated rather than tested by difficult choices. The lack of character flaws or conflicting impulses results in a flat, illustrative protagonist rather than a living one.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal resistance or contradictory impulses, functioning primarily as a vessel for the ritual rather than a complex agent. The "past life memory" serves as a convenient inciting trigger rather than a felt burden, and the emotional resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character interiority relies heavily on label-only emotions ("reverie," "awe," "sorrow") and melodramatic physical cues ("quaking in her soul," "sob escaped") rather than embodied complexity. The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her progression feels performed rather than felt, moving from grief to perfect peace without a struggle that tests her distinct personality. The resolution dissolves her internal conflict too neatly, lacking the jagged edges of genuine human grief.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions more as a symbolic archetype ("chained liberator") than a living character; her motivation is delivered via abstract labels ("quiet ember," "monastic devotion") rather than embodied desire. The transition from helpless prisoner to commanding figure is unearned by internal struggle, and her psychological state after twelve years of solitude is unexplored beyond romanticized resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s motivation is stated clearly, but her emotional journey is resolved through a ritualistic epiphany rather than genuine struggle or difficult choice. The internal conflict regarding the betrayal is summarized rather than dramatized, and the "tear" at the climax feels like a stock gesture of release without a deeper, embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated via abstract metaphor ("press her ear against destiny’s door") rather than dramatized through friction. Her transition from "thief" to "author" feels unearned, as the crucial insight is provided by a magical prop rather than internal struggle or competence. The character functions more as a vessel for the imagery than a distinct agent making hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    The character functions as a vehicle for the theme rather than a living person, with emotions that feel performed ("tear traced a warm path") and interiority relying on abstract labels ("fortress against grief") rather than embodied contradiction. The "dramatic narration" trait feels like an imposed quirk rather than a natural behavior, and the resolution lacks a difficult, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("authentically whole," "transformative betrayal") rather than embodied emotion. The transition from victim to empowered protector is summarized rather than earned through struggle, and the relationship with the child feels functional rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a passive observer and vehicle for the concept rather than a character with embodied struggle. Her motivation and traits are delivered via direct exposition ("She was mildly obsessed," "Her motivation burned with clarity") rather than demonstrated through costly choices. There is no internal conflict or resistance; she simply performs the task she set out to do.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Unit Seven’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the pivotal shift in behavior relies on a passive information dump (“program archives surfaced”) rather than active discovery, reducing agency. The required trait “remarkably composed” is adhered to but flattens the emotional arc of the epiphany, making the internal struggle feel more data-driven than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Motivation is stated via exposition ("Her motivation was...") rather than dramatized through struggle. Emotions are delivered as abstract labels ("shock, fear, and dawning wonder") without embodied physical experience or internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a consistent but static archetype of the "wise elder," while Kael serves as a one-dimensional strawman without credible counter-pressure. The lack of genuine internal conflict or a costly trade-off for Elara limits the emotional depth of the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is a consistent protagonist with a clear motivation, but his internal landscape feels static. The trait "mechanically warm" is used as a repetitive label (four times) rather than demonstrated through varied action or evolving emotional cost. His "doubt" is mentioned but never truly threatens his resolve or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority is flattened by the mechanical repetition of the phrase "lately inspired." The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or meaningful resistance, resulting in a linear emotional arc without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara’s internal state is articulated through abstract labels ("swaying certainties," "fault-tolerant oracle") rather than embodied action. The transformation from arrogance to humility feels unearned, relying on a convenient epiphany triggered by the logbook rather than a struggle with live consequences. Motivation is explicitly stated ("Her motivation now was...") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, anchoring Leo’s skepticism against his need for redemption. However, the emotional epiphany relies on summarized interiority ("visceral clarity," "crushing burden") rather than embodied reaction, and the realization feels slightly like an intellectual download.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara acts as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she faces no internal contradiction, meaningful obstacles, or costs for her choices. Her "sole motivation" to witness is fulfilled effortlessly, rendering her a vessel for the theme rather than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a flawless archetype of competence without internal conflict, causing the narrative to lack necessary friction. Liam's transformation is instantaneous and frictionless, serving as a prop for the protagonist's success rather than a fully realized character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as an observational vessel rather than a distinct character; the label "odd" is asserted but not dramatized through idiosyncratic behavior or choice. Internal conflict is absent, and his "sensitively perceptive" nature is delivered via exposition ("His attribute... was not a choice") rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear, but the emotional arc is rushed; a twenty-year estrangement dissolves instantly upon Elara's arrival without on-page resistance or negotiation. The resolution feels unearned by the immediate action, relying on a sentimental collapse of conflict rather than a dramatized interpersonal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "hidden assumptions," "avoid complexity’s pain") rather than embodied emotion. Elara’s breakthrough feels mandated by the priest's lecture rather than earned through genuine internal struggle or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to become the conductor of unheard symphonies") remains abstract and overly poetic, lacking grounding in concrete human need. Interiority relies on high-concept descriptions ("chronological homesickness lived in her bones") rather than conflicting impulses or difficult choices. The emotional arc resolves too neatly into "purposeful joy" without a struggle that tests her character.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated but relies on labeled abstractions ("sorrow," "shame," "compassion") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The pivotal turn hinges on the tablet asking her a question ("What if you forgave yourself?"), which externalizes the realization and dilutes her agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a passive recipient of Kael’s healing ritual rather than an active driver of the scene; she undergoes the transformation without generating friction or making difficult choices. The "emotional numbness" is stated as a diagnostic label rather than dramatized through behavior, and its resolution feels like a therapeutic breakthrough rather than a character-driven victory.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is a competent, proactive protagonist who makes a clear choice under pressure (coding the message). However, her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("credible curiosity," "panic was a luxury") rather than embodied emotion, making her feel slightly theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The character functions primarily as a vessel for the theme, lacking deep internal friction. The realization—"tears were not weakness"—relies on diagnostic label-speak ("body’s honest response") rather than dramatized discovery, and the resolution ("never again fear") creates a soft reset that removes future complexity too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("gentle curiosity," "ethically playful") rather than embodied behavior or distinct voice. The internal conflict is stated in summary ("motivation warred with his ethics") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, leading to a resolution that feels conceptually imposed rather than psychologically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vehicle than a living character; her emotions are described via abstraction ("not grief, but awe") rather than embodied in reaction. The internal landscape is rendered in heavy metaphors ("acoustic tapestry") that distance the reader from her immediate, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s shift from "affectionate detachment" to "raw exposure" is effectively charted, offering a clear internal arc. However, the pivotal moment of emotional awakening relies heavily on summary ("he lived it") and clichéd physical cues ("unbidden tears") rather than a specific, dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation pivots instantly from transactional to transformative without sufficient resistance or earned development ("Motivation crystallized instantly"). The emotional calibration is too perfect; Elias and Liam act with a therapeutic openness that lacks the friction of genuine human interaction, resulting in "label-only feelings" rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is stated via abstract labels ("quiet, persistent fire," "boldly sympathetic") rather than dramatized through friction. The emotional progression is too tidy; Elara and Kael move from strangers to profound soulmates instantly without awkwardness or testing, resulting in "perfect emotional calibration" that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's specific perspective as an illustrator flavors the narration well, grounding magical acts in artistic precision. However, the emotional anchor (her mother) arrives only at the climax as a payoff rather than a complication, and her success relies on a convenient "rare attribute" rather than a character-specific struggle or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s internal state is legible, but her motivation ("mathematics of emotion") remains abstract and cerebral rather than viscerally felt. The emotional arc relies on a convenient magical resolution rather than a character-driven choice with cost; her grief is soothed by a vision rather than processed through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is stated explicitly ("to become visible") rather than dramatized through friction or subtext. The transition from twelve years of isolation to immediate trust lacks the necessary psychological resistance or awkwardness to feel authentic; the trait "kindly methodical" serves as a told label rather than a shown behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's transformation is instantaneous upon seeing a leaf (lines 80-86), lacking the dramatized struggle or vacillation required for a full narrative arc. The epiphany feels unearned because the deep-seated "blind spot" of twenty years vanishes without internal resistance or behavioral relapse.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is legible, but the protagonist’s internal struggle is resolved too easily; a seventeen-year trauma evaporates after a single convenient encounter. Emotional distinctness is flattened by the repetition of the specific phrase "wryly earnest" to describe Elias, Anya, and Elara, making their interiorities sound identical.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("motivation was compassion itself") rather than dramatized through struggle or high-stakes choice. The emotional arc relies on a sudden, frictionless shift from "sharp anxiety" to "quiet joy," lacking the resistance or internal cost required for a compelling transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal arc is static; she begins competent and ends validated without significant struggle or doubt. The "reactively visionary" trait functions more as a plot device to deliver exposition than a deep character flaw or constraint. The emotional journey feels smoothed over, lacking the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's internal state is conveyed primarily through diagnostic labels ("quiet desperation," "emotional avoidance," "self-acceptance") rather than dramatized behavior or specific, embodied memories. The internal conflict is summarized via abstract nouns ("emotional armor") instead of resistant actions, making the emotional arc feel theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s skepticism is established as a trait but abandons the field immediately upon finding the artifact, offering little resistance to the plot's magical requirements. Liam functions primarily as a prop for the protagonist's realization rather than an agent of pressure. The internal conflict is resolved too neatly, lacking the embodied struggle required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation is abstract and declared ("to discover what happens after goodbye") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance. The emotional arc relies on clichés ("tears... traced warm paths") and an unearned, instantaneous resolution where millennia of boredom simply "evaporate." The protagonist observes rather than struggles, lacking the contradictory impulses or difficult choices required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation is distinctly drawn, and the "honest child" persona creates a clear internal friction against her father's legacy. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat detached; the resolution is processed intellectually in summary ("She would offer...") rather than dramatized through a visceral struggle or difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the prompt’s philosophy than a living character making hard choices; her "devotion" is stated but not tested by genuine friction. The lack of contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs leaves her characterization static, observing rather than struggling.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a passive observer rather than an active agent; he records rather than chooses. His motivation is clearly stated ("hunger to discover the texture"), but he lacks contradictory impulses or internal obstacles that would generate dramatic friction. The "choice" to interpret the poison label as agency is smooth and purely cerebral, lacking visible emotional cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's identity as a "myth buster" is established by label rather than action; she accepts the supernatural elements immediately without the skepticism her profession implies. The "reimagining" ability functions as a convenient plot device rather than a grounded character trait or skill, lowering the stakes of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("orderly intuitive," "motivation was clear") rather than dramatized behavior or interior conflict. The "dual allegiance" is stated as a strain but resolves without a difficult choice or sacrifice; the protagonist finds a frictionless third option that satisfies both sides without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation is stated rather than dramatized; Kael’s "purposefully curious nature" is labeled but contradicts his static, reverent behavior in the scene. Emotional states are summarized via exposition ("waves of grief," "deeply personal mission") rather than embodied in specific actions or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is an idealized archetype rather than a complex character; her "magnetic calm" and "profound trust" insulate her from genuine struggle. There is no internal contradiction or meaningful cost to her actions, resulting in static competence rather than a dramatic arc. The blindness is handled with a convenient workaround that erases the handicap rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("dry-witted," "subtly confident") rather than dramatized behavior; the single line of dialogue ("Noted, colleague") is insufficient to earn the specific "dry-witted" trait. Internal conflict is summarized as "quiet rebellion" but never tested by pressure or a difficult choice. The protagonist moves through the scene with unearned competence, lacking the flaws or struggle required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine flaws. Her traits are delivered via direct exposition ("Her attribute was not mere calm but infinite patience") rather than emerging from behavior under pressure. The absence of struggle or potential for failure makes her a perfect instrument rather than a protagonist making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    The internal struggle between panic and the need for patience is well-dramatized and embodied. However, the motivation for "redemption" is stated but never grounded in specific backstory, leaving the character's deeper drive feeling generic and hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kael’s motivation is explicitly stated ("His motivation was sacred") rather than dramatized through struggle. The "son of the boy who cried wolf" trait functions as a label; the emotional shift in Elias is too instantaneous ("decades of command" collapses in one glance) to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.4)
    Motivation is clearly stated ("repay a debt") but emotions are delivered via labels ("mournful elation") rather than embodied reaction. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or agency beyond the script of the backstory, acting as a functional vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character; her motivation is stated in abstract, lofty terms ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") without dramatized personal cost or conflicting desire. The "dream-logic" motivation bypasses genuine agency, resulting in a performance of ritual rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Motivation is abstract ("restore lost faith") and interiority relies on labeled emotion ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") rather than embodied reaction. The protagonist's internal state is asserted through summary rather than revealed through contradictory impulses or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal landscape is described through abstract labels ("profound quest") rather than embodied emotion.

The motivation is stated explicitly by the narrator rather than dramatized through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and label-driven traits ("harmless eccentric," "sharp intelligence") rather than dramatized behavior. Internal conflict is absent; emotions are described with stock phrases ("cold dread") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.7)
    Internal conflict is largely handled through abstract labels ("noose of pride," "rhythm of regret") rather than dramatized, embodied struggle. The protagonist's emotional breakthrough feels like a therapeutic gift granted by the magic system rather than a hard-won result of personal agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    Anahera is a consistent focalizer, but her motivation is stated abstractly ("graft new meaning") rather than dramatized through pressure or difficult choice. She faces no opposition—Leo is asleep—which results in a lack of status dynamics, risk, or genuine internal contradiction. The attribute "shrewdly innocent" appears only as a label and does not constrain her behavior or generate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; her internal state is labeled ("quiet ache," "pensive mirth") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The epiphany feels unearned, arriving as a "crystalline moment" of mature understanding without a prior struggle or cost to justify the transformation. Motivation is told via exposition ("Her motivation was...") rather than shown through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elara’s internal shift is driven by a magical epiphany ("nested awakening") rather than a pressure-tested choice. The realization is "triggered" by the coin’s warmth and the light beam, reducing her agency to receiving a download of insight. The transition from "authority" to "guardian" is summarized in interiority rather than dramatized through a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by adjective-heavy labels ("charming rogue scholar," "cartographer of hope") rather than dramatized behavior. Motivation is explicitly stated in summary ("fiercely personal," "stand guard over his own spark") rather than revealed through a difficult choice under pressure. The character lacks internal conflict, moving through the scene with a static earnestness that contradicts the "rogue" descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for abstract description rather than an agent of choice. He makes no decisions that alter the trajectory; the climax occurs *to* him via external forces (wind, shell resonance) rather than through his agency. Interiority is replaced by labeled states ("slow accumulation of longing") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine struggle; she is a static vehicle for the setting. Emotional states are labeled ("foxglove regret," "devotion") rather than embodied, and there are no micro-choices under pressure to reveal character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated ("burned with quiet intensity") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or behavior. The protagonist's agency is undermined by the magical ink well, which performs the critical work of rearranging the text and solving the puzzle. Internal conflict is summarized as "weight of ninety-seven days" rather than dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.3)
    Kael functions as a problem-solving device rather than a character; his "dappled resolve" is stated metaphorically rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The secondary characters undergo an unearned, melodramatic transformation from skepticism to tearful awe in a single beat, resolving complex emotional states with artificial speed.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist whose internal conflict—safety via reinvention versus the integrity of testimony—is palpable and drives the narrative. The transition from hiding to revealing is motivated by a concrete sensory trigger (dust/Starlight) and grounded in his backstory with Lyra. The choice to write in the ledger is a strong, character-defining action that earns the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("featherly determined resolve") rather than embodied habits or contradictions. Her emotional journey—from "ache" to "peace"—lacks internal resistance or wavering, reading as a linear progression of thoughts rather than a struggle. The interiority relies on diagnostic statements ("she embodied a featherly determined resolve") rather than showing the difficulty of her resolve in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is abstract ("rhythm of belonging") and resolved through passive observation rather than agency. Elara serves as a vessel for poetic descriptions and memories, lacking genuine internal friction or difficult choices to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s internal arc from retention to release is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("cheerful gloom," "stubborn hope") rather than embodied sensation. While her actions drive the inquiry, the emotional climax feels somewhat performed via the tears-and-smile trope rather than arising from a specific, visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    Corbin functions as a flawless device rather than a character; he plans a complex interaction and executes it without doubt, struggle, or error. The emotional payoff feels unearned because his competence is absolute, and there is no personal cost or risk of failure to test his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype enacting a ritual rather than a character with conflicting desires or distinct interiority. Emotions are consistently labeled with abstract nouns ("quiet certainty," "fear alchemized into resolve") rather than embodied through specific, visceral reactions or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is depicted as static and idealized, possessing "perfect clarity" and a "rare attribute" without engaging in struggle or paying a price. Her interiority consists largely of abstract affirmations of her existing wisdom rather than a conflict-driven progression. There are no flaws or contradictory impulses to generate tension; she begins and ends the story in a state of high competence and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("bargained innocence," "alchemy") rather than embodied emotion or specific behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence with no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he performs the plot with "unwavering" certainty. The characterization relies on abstract labels like "perceptively calm assurance" rather than embodied emotion or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation for redemption is clear and drives a meaningful Decisive Change at closure. However, the attribute "operatively gentle" reads as an imposed label rather than organic behavior, and the transition from war criminal to gentle negotiator relies on summary rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a compelling contradiction, and his internal conflict drives the scene effectively. However, the narrative relies on diagnostic labeling (e.g., "morality as fluid," "sentimental man was locked away") to define his complexity rather than fully dramatizing it through behavior. The transition from titan to weeping penitent feels slightly rushed and performed rather than inextricably earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions more as a thematic archetype than a fully realized character; her "courtesan" background is rationalized via internal monologue but does not visibly shape her tactics or constraints in the scene. While her motivation to "harvest echoes" is stated clearly, her internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses or genuine behavioral cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a vessel for a thematic thesis rather than a living character; his "uncommon serenity" is applied as a static label (repeated four times) rather than a trait tested by pressure. The emotional progression is linear and tidy, lacking the internal contradiction or messy resistance required to make the final renunciation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established, and her choice to sacrifice the moth wing (her specific goal) for the monarch (the opposing force) creates a strong character beat. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted") rather than embodied feeling, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist acts as a vessel for the ritual rather than a living agent navigating conflict. While her motivation (redemption) is stated, she faces no difficult choices in the scene; the process proceeds smoothly to success without testing her resolve or forcing a trade-off. The interiority relies on abstract labels ("snowmelt ardor") rather than embodied, conflicting emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara's "fracture" is a compelling starting state, but her internal arc is resolved passively through a magical artifact rather than earned struggle. The moment of change is summarized as "interpretation flooded her," bypassing the necessary dramatization of choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Enlil functions more as a vessel for the thematic concept than a fully realized character; while his "frugality" is labeled, it never forces a difficult trade-off or cost within the scene. The lack of internal contradiction or contradictory impulses leaves him static, moving from preparation to success without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a thematic device rather than a character, with her "scheming" trait asserted in exposition but appearing only as standard therapeutic guidance in scene. Kael’s emotional arc—from decades of rigid bitterness to tearful release—resolves instantly upon touching an object, lacking the necessary psychological struggle or resistance to earn the transformation. The emotional shift relies on "cellular memory" as a convenient switch rather than a dramatized human process.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a competent procedural vehicle rather than a character with genuine interiority or conflict. Her "quiet certainty" precludes doubt or struggle, and her motivation is delivered via expository summary ("Her motivation burned with quiet urgency") rather than dramatized need. There is no emotional cost to her success; she performs the ritual perfectly without facing contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("endearingly feisty resolve," "feisty childhood voice") rather than demonstrated traits. The dialogue at the climax ("No, my dear feisty girl") feels unnatural and performative, serving the theme rather than organic interaction. While motivation is clear, the emotional reconciliation is hasty and unearned by the preceding conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with a clear motivation, but her internal journey relies on a convenient epiphany rather than earned struggle. The "trembling fingers" opener is a stock shorthand for stress, and her emotional shift in the bathroom ("clarity struck") feels unearned by prior on-page friction or failure. The resolution lacks a sense of character-specific cost; she simply changes her mind and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; her trait ("arcane linguist") is a plot utility, and her "fear" in the climax is stated rather than deeply felt or foreshadowed by internal struggle. Kael is a pure plot device to facilitate the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lyra’s grief is palpable, but her pivotal transformation relies heavily on an external instruction manual (the journal) rather than an earned internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent problem-solver rather than a character under pressure; she identifies a solution and executes it without internal doubt, contradiction, or emotional cost. The prompt-required trait "warmly methodical" appears as a repeated label rather than a driver of difficult choices or trade-offs. The lack of genuine struggle or potential for failure makes the character feels like a vehicle for the plot rather than a living agent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation is declared via high diction ("visceral, soul-deep imperative") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or doubt. His pivotal choice to "listen" rather than "project" arrives via sudden intuition ("Certainty flooded...") rather than a struggle against his instincts, weakening his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a complex agent under pressure; her motivation is clear but lacks internal friction or doubt. The vision of Master Aris acts as convenient affirmation rather than a challenge, smoothing over potential psychological struggle. There is no visible on-page cost to her choices; her success is preordained by her backstory competence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the theme than a fully realized character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("to sculpt identity") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices.

While her role is clear, her emotional arc feels performed, relying on labels like "preemptively nostalgic" rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is professionally distinct, but lacks internal conflict; her motivation is "steady," precluding the contradictory impulses that create depth under pressure. The emotional arc is a straight line from seeking to finding, with no significant hesitation or cost to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("warmly observant nature," "lesson in patience") rather than organic behavior. Kael’s sudden pivot from rigid silence to a profound, shared metaphor feels dictated by the author's need for resolution rather than believable internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is established clearly, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("inheritance of bone-deep claustrophobia") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist's emotional journey is processed through summary and abstraction ("motivation sharpened," "spirit light") rather than observed through distinct, difficult micro-choices. The resolution feels internally inevitable rather than earned by overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "shift perception from absence to presence," "anguish to tender recognition") rather than embodied experience. Elara functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a distinct individual, and Leo’s emotional transformation is a "soft reset" triggered by instruction rather than earned struggle. The "grief-shadowed eyes" and "hollow ache" rely on stock emotive phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype without internal contradiction or flaws. Her final "choice" is a realization rather than a difficult trade-off between competing values, and her "wisely adventurous" nature is told via labels rather than demonstrated through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("tender shadow keeper," "mistook her empathy for fragility") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through abstract summary of feelings ("vise-tight chest," "crushing expectations") rather than concrete, idiosyncratic experience.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("pyramid scheme survivor," "deep-sea weight") rather than embodied behavior or specific interiority. The attribute "virtuously mischievous" is inserted as a tag rather than demonstrated through organic action until the epilogue. The emotional arc feels performative, resolving complex trauma through a single magical transaction without visible psychological resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the prompt’s requirements than a living character; her "eloquently silent" nature is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through friction. Internal conflict is minimal, summarized as a "quiet, persistent ache" and a "tremor," which resolves instantly upon finding the external object. There is no agonizing choice or behavioral contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael’s motivation ("to capture the shape of possibility") remains abstract and distant, lacking the concrete grounding required for empathy. His internal state is conveyed through high-level labels ("shivering bliss," "awe") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion or struggle. The climax involves a release of tension but lacks a difficult, character-defining choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("broken heart," "sorrow") rather than dramatized complexity. The transition from deep loneliness to being "mended" by a single note feels unearned and rapid, lacking the resistance or contradictory impulses that create depth. The character functions more as a thematic vessel than a living person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated in abstract labels ("fidelity to the silenced," "quiet, fierce vow") rather than demonstrated through complex, embodied behavior. Reliance on clichés like a "small, defiant smile" and the physical impossibility of smelling "resolve" flattens the character into an archetype rather than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist acts as a functional archetype executing a ritual rather than a complex character with contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on stated memories and abstract concepts ("muscle memory," "mercy") rather than immediate, conflicted emotion or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on stated internal states ("quiet fire," "cherished the quiet beauty") rather than dramatized desire or struggle. Elara lacks internal contradiction or agency beyond performing a rote ritual; her emotional experience is delivered through labels rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("to befriend uncertainty") rather than dramatized through pressure. Elara's internal conflict is resolved too neatly via realization rather than a costly choice, and her "rigid need for control" acts more as a label than a genuine obstacle to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is abstract and intellectual ("mathematics of mercy"), leading to diagnostic label-speak in interiority ("Mercy_Coefficient_01 = hesitation") that distances the reader. Emotions are stated rather than embodied ("Tears streamed, not of sorrow, but revelation"), and the protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is a competent functionary of the plot with clear motivation ("reverence"), but she lacks internal friction or flaws.

The lack of hesitation or error makes her feel like an idealized vessel for the theme rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Leo is a compelling concept—a blue-collar mystic—but his internal life is asserted rather than dramatized. The transition from observation to resolution relies on a convenient "empathic memory" download rather than active character struggle or deduction, robbing him of agency in the climax. His "compulsion" is stated but faces no significant internal resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.8)

He functions as a vehicle for the ritual, enduring physical strain without facing a psychological trade-off or a moment of genuine doubt that would deepen his characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara is defined primarily by labels ("sensibly eccentric," "petrichor collector") rather than dramatized complexity. The sudden introduction of "psychometry" as a method feels like a convenient trait to accelerate the plot rather than an earned character skill, reducing agency to a magical touch.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on label-speak ("spirited," "perpetually learning") and abstract assertions of motivation ("scaffold complexity with simplicity") rather than embodied desire.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elian functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; he lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a hierarchy of values tested by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s internal state is articulated through summary ("Her motivation was no longer passive grief") rather than dramatized choice or reaction. While her shift from mourner to navigator is legible, the emotional progression feels rushed and lacks the resistance or ambivalence that would make the transformation earned. The "blessed pariah" trait is established but functions more as a license for her presence than a source of interpersonal or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is defined chiefly by high-concept labels ("crisis actor," "historian") and abstract interiority rather than specific, individualized choices. Her "benevolent ruthlessness" is stated as an attribute but operates mostly as a pacing device ("forbade her to linger") rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction or difficult tradeoffs. The transition from actor to survivor is asserted in the exposition rather than dramatized through behavior that distinguishes her past from her present.

    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated, and her renunciation of the mercury glass demonstrates a distinct shift in stance. However, the internal transition is largely summarized ("numbness of avoidance had become a heavier burden") rather than dramatized through conflicted behavior or failed attempts. The emotional breakthrough feels diagnostic and rapid, lacking the visceral struggle expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's backstory relies on a specific chess error ("Scholar's Mate") that creates a significant credibility gap; a royal tutor and prince losing a state tournament to a four-move beginner trap suggests incompetence rather than a tragic miscalculation. This technical flaw undermines the character's established expertise and the gravity of his guilt. While the internal motivation is clear, the emotional arc feels mechanically tied to the prompt's chess metaphors rather than organic psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.9)
    Elara functions as a flawless thematic vehicle rather than a person; she lacks internal contradiction or doubt. Her "defiance" faces no genuine cost, and her interaction with Borin lacks the friction of a true relationship under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation and emotion are often summarized or labeled ("motivation burned with quiet clarity," "conviction warming") rather than dramatized through friction or subtext. The character's internal state is articulated with diagnostic precision that feels performative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.6)
    Motivation is stated clearly but executed through abstract metaphors ("fracture echo deep within his bones") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elias acts as a vessel for sentiment rather than a complex character, with emotions dictated via adjectival labels ("exquisite ache") rather than embodied action.

No visible cost is paid for his choice, leaving the emotional arc feeling performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara is defined primarily by explicit metaphorical labels ("patchwork," "fractured landscape") rather than subtextual behavior. Her internal state is summarized through exposition ("motivation was not repair") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s defining trait of "involuntary truthfulness" is relegated to a flashback and internal monologue, failing to constrain her choices in the present scene. Her motivation is clear but delivered through expository summary ("Her motivation was not profit but...") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character; his "eccentricity" is declared but not dramatized through idiosyncratic choice or behavior. The emotional arc is smooth but relies on abstract internal summary ("shaped by witnessed isolation") rather than embodied struggle or specific backstory, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a functional protagonist, but his defining trait ("empirically intuitive") operates as a told label rather than a dramatized complexity. The internal conflict is resolved through a convenient external guide (ants) rather than a character-defining choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and urgent, but her internal state relies on abstract labels ("hollowing of spirit") rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    Emotional states are labeled ("feral nostalgia," "jealousy," "jaded wonder") rather than dramatized through distinct, embodied behavior. The protagonist's profound shift from terror to peace is triggered by a low-pressure wave from a dream-figure, feeling unearned and summary-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a living character; her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("motivation crystallized with quiet certainty," "landscape of vulnerability") rather than embodied feeling. While her physical actions are clear, the "silent virus" backstory serves as a static trait rather than a source of active, contradictory pressure in the scene. The emotional arc is summarized through epiphany rather than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("stories of resilience," "emotional anchor," "unguarded heart") rather than embodied experience. The protagonist's struggle is resolved through abstract self-analysis ("demanded emotional honesty") rather than dramatized psychological friction. The sudden, therapeutic epiphany feels unearned by the brief setup.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her background as a "gossip-column exorcist" feels like a high-concept label rather than a lived reality informing her behavior beyond the prompt's requirements. The emotional arc is linear—regret to relief—without the contradictory impulses or resistance that characterize deep literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex individual; her "ache of being the sole rememberer" is stated (line 26) rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Her journey lacks internal resistance or distinct personality traits beyond her role as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist’s obsession is compellingly dramatized through the ritual, creating a strong sense of internal drive. Interiority is vivid, though the character relies slightly on the narrator's label ("eminently peculiar") rather than purely shown behavior outside the ritual itself. The realization at the end feels earned by the physical and mental strain depicted.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.1)
    Character motivation is stated rather than dramatized ("left a void," "quest to understand"). Kael functions as a thematic delivery device rather than a distinct individual, offering therapeutic monologues ("Learn its frequency. Let it move through you") that lack naturalism. Emotional shifts are labeled ("quiet wildfire of connection," "quiet awe") instead of being embodied through specific action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is explained through abstract summary ("gentle imperative: to widen perspectives responsibly") rather than dramatized desire. Her internal arc is resolved through observation and labeled emotion ("profound understanding") rather than a costly choice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist functions as a flawless advice-dispenser who encounters no internal resistance or blind spots during the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The protagonist is defined largely by abstract labels ("haunted euphoria") and stated motivation rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional shift from grief to renewal feels performed through ritual rather than earned by internal struggle, relying on diagnostic self-awareness ("honoring both craft and memory") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character motivation is abstract ("cure for loneliness") and the transformation is unearned, occurring via sudden epiphany ("Clarity washed over her") rather than dramatic pressure. The "desperately jocular" trait is applied as a label and demonstrated only once, failing to create genuine behavioral armor or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character; her grief is labeled rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific memory. The emotion is handled with diagnostic distance (e.g., "uncharted emotional depths"), and her "inner compass" motivation feels abstract. There is no struggle or contradiction in her interiority; she feels purely competent and spiritually ready from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on abstract labels ("thresh meaning," "confidently uncertain") rather than embodied emotion. While the transition from guilt to resolve is logical, the emotional shift feels smoothed over by these repetitive thematic markers rather than earned through visceral struggle. The character functions more as a vessel for the prompt's concepts than a living presence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through abstract labels like "joyful sorrow" and "charismatic grace" rather than specific, embodied action. The interaction relies on a secondary character who functions as a convenient plot device with implausibly philosophical dialogue ("silence is a canvas"), undermining credible motivation and distinct voice. There is no genuine internal conflict; the character transitions from lonely to validated without a cost-bearing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, but his transition from arsonist to healer is smoothed over by labels ("volcanic tenderness") rather than enacted through difficult choices. The "analytically intuitive" trait acts as a superpower that dissolves obstacles instantly, bypassing the struggle required to reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene’s central action, but interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("living archive," "quiet fire") rather than contradictory human impulse. The emotional climax is filtered through the diagnostic label "auroral sorrow," which distances the reader from the protagonist's specific, embodied experience. The character functions more as a lyrical vessel than a distinct psychological agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael functions as a flat archetype of the "wise expert" without internal struggle or genuine cost. His motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through conflicting desires ("not mere rescue, but proof"), and his "unique attribute" feels like an expository superpower rather than a grounded trait. The character lacks the friction of messy humanity, resulting in a competent but emotionally inert vessel for the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on archetypes ("silent guardian," "troubled soul") rather than specific personality traits or internal conflict. Kael functions as a plot device to dispense wisdom, while Elara lacks agency, serving merely as a recipient of the lesson without active participation or resistance. Motivation is explicitly stated in exposition ("to teach the darkness...") rather than dramatized through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.3)

Elias is purely benevolent without internal contradiction or struggle, and Leo's arc from insecurity to belonging is summarized rather than earned through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    Motivation is stated rather than dramatized, relying on generic labels like "walls of salt and regret" that dissolve instantly via magic rather than character struggle. The emotional arc is a soft reset where trauma vanishes without a gritty, earned process of choice or consequence. Elara functions more as a vessel for the prompt's requirements than a living agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist's motivation and backstory are clear, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("morally ambiguous regret," "conscious method") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the prompt's concepts rather than a person with agency; "aesthetically driven" serves as a label rather than a source of conflicting values or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.9)
    Character traits are labeled rather than dramatized; the phrase "innocently cunning" is repeated as a diagnostic tag without behavioral evidence (arranging flowers is gentle, not cunning).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a thematic catalyst rather than a character with internal conflict; her "powerfully gentle grace" frames her as flawless from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characters serve primarily as mouthpieces for the story's thesis rather than acting as distinct individuals with internal contradiction. Leo’s skepticism "melting" upon hearing a brief explanation lacks psychological realism or earned struggle, and the dialogue feels didactic rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is a clearly defined archetype with a functional motivation, but her interiority is largely dominated by abstract processing of the magic system rather than idiosyncratic character work. The emotion of "anguished joy" is labeled rather than embodied, leaving the character feeling slightly like a vehicle for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist’s emotional arc is precipitous; she shifts from deep-seated fear to total acceptance merely by watching a video, lacking the friction of genuine internal struggle. Her interiority relies on abstract labels ("sacred motivation," "luminous regret") rather than embodied psychological complexity, making the epiphany feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("shed the layer of shame," "shed indiscriminate trust") rather than embodied emotion or choice.

The protagonist feels like a vehicle for the theme rather than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is abstract and philosophical, lacking immediate personal stakes or risk. She functions primarily as a passive observer of the vision rather than an active agent making difficult, cost-laden choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("moonstruck dreamer," "grief") rather than specific, contradictory behaviors or desires. Her internal struggle is summarized through metaphor rather than dramatized via difficult choices, and the resolution relies on an external voice delivering wisdom rather than an earned psychological shift. The emotional arc feels performative, lacking the resistance and embodied cost required for a 600-word character study.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; his "dreamless" nature and lack of grief remove internal friction.

He faces no difficult choices on the page, merely enacting a competency without risk of failure or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    Kael functions as a plot device rather than a character; he faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara is a passive protagonist who observes and follows rather than acting; her "motivation" is abstractly stated ("to find where unused courage waited") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The guides function as archetypal dispensers of wisdom rather than characters with distinct agendas, and the emotional arc relies on "therapy-speak" labels (e.g., "self you were always meant to become") rather than embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict is viscerally grounded in the "nerve-fire" of her injury, making the emotional stakes physical and immediate. The shift from "cowardice disguised as obedience" to the final act of defiance is earned through this embodied struggle. Her interiority remains specific and avoids stock responses, driving the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael is a static archetype of virtue without internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he experiences "serene fulfillment" and "no bitterness" rather than struggle. His diminutive scale is a great constraint, but his choices are summarized habits ("each timeless dawn") rather than dramatic decisions made under immediate pressure. The characterization relies on labeled traits ("regally unpretentious grace") rather than demonstrated behavior in a difficult crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's arc relies on convenient amnesia regarding her own failsafe to manufacture a reveal, undermining her competence. The emotional resolution is delivered by an external recording rather than an active, difficult choice in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara is consistent but lacks internal conflict; her past as an insurgent is stated rather than demonstrated through tactical grit in the present. The dismissal of the "innocent child" constraint with a mere scoff feels convenient, bypassing the potential for a hard-won character choice or genuine hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character motivation is articulated through abstract labels ("shame," "fear") rather than dramatized behavior. The emotional arc resolves too easily via a magical proxy action (untangling threads) rather than psychological struggle. The sudden shift to "self-compassion" feels unearned and summary-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's "consciously wild" nature ("rejecting civilization's rigid cages") flatly contradicts his central action: repairing a high-tech sensor-laden drone on a workbench. The core emotion, "serene anger," is applied as a repetitive label (four times) rather than a felt, embodied experience, resulting in a static emotional arc that lacks genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is competent, but her internal conflict is resolved via summary ("conscience roared louder") rather than dramatized struggle. The phrase "she was bravely conflicted" is a diagnostic label that tells rather than shows the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her logical approach provides a distinct internal framework. However, the emotional pivot at the climax feels slightly mechanical, and her primary trait is reinforced through repetitive labeling rather than purely through nuanced action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is labeled ("quiet, desperate need") rather than dramatized through struggle or resistance. The "constellation tattooist" identity feels ornamental, lacking organic integration with the "cry translator" role that actually drives the plot; the emotional arc relies on diagnostic summaries ("profound loneliness") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on explanatory labels ("socially perceptive artist," "deeply personal") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara displays absolute competence with no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she diagnoses and solves the problem without genuine struggle.

    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("gentle radical," "retrocognitive trap") rather than dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara reads as an idealized archetype—the wise keeper—rather than a flesh-and-blood protagonist.

Her interiority is abstract and thematic rather than embodied, functioning more as a vessel for the story's message than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara is defined primarily by the repeated label "wistfully pragmatic" rather than by choices that carry genuine risk or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is clear and the protagonist's fear is central, but the struggle relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("claustrophobic," "prudently adventurous") rather than embodied reaction.

The emotional cost is stated ("panic clawed") but resolved quickly without lasting on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)

Emotional states are summarized via exposition ("fragile certainty") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.8)
    Characterization relies on explicit labels ("dynamically observant nature") and abstract concepts ("grace," "amnesty") rather than embodied emotion or choice. There is no internal struggle or contradictory impulse; the protagonist simply moves from grief to healing via an unearned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.7)
    Leo functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a living character; his "perceptively calm" attribute is stated as a label rather than demonstrated through restraint under pressure. Kai serves as a convenient prop for the lesson rather than a distinct individual with genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation to decode the inscriptions is clear, but her internal struggle is conveyed largely through summary ("For months...") rather than active contradiction in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("guarded heart," "solitude") rather than dramatized behavior or interaction. The central internal change—"unbending"—is depicted as a smooth physiological release rather than a psychological struggle, resulting in an unearned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by repeated labels ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious") rather than demonstrated traits or difficult choices.

She faces no internal contradiction or meaningful cost; she simply performs the required ritual without hesitation or personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.4)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated via abstract phrases ("patch the gaping hole," "arrogant youth") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page desires. The protagonist functions as a vessel for prompt adjectives, lacking embodied behavior or distinct interiority that would make the emotional journey authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    Leo’s specific background (roadie turned appraiser) creates a distinct perspective, anchored by details like the "C-sharp" floorboard. However, the internal shift relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("insulating emotionally with facts") rather than dramatized friction. The epiphany feels rushed, resolving a lifelong coping mechanism in a single beat without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s internal arc is clear, shifting from control to acceptance, though the pivot relies heavily on internal summary rather than dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a vessel for the ritual rather than an agent making difficult choices. Her motivation is stated abstractly ("preserve wonder") but never tested by pressure or genuine cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but the emotional arc resolves too easily via external wisdom (graffiti) rather than internal struggle. The character's change in state feels like a label swap ("truth-seeking" to "solace") rather than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara has a clear arc from observer to participant, and the motivation is legible. However, interiority relies on abstract labels ("aching voids," "darker memories") rather than specific, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her professional background provides a solid foundation for the conflict. However, her interiority relies on slightly overwrought descriptors ("soul tuned to forgotten whispers") rather than grounded psychological nuance. The choice she makes is earned, though the coffee-dregs prophecy slightly reduces the weight of her agency by guaranteeing the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent archetypal priestess rather than a nuanced character; her success is never in doubt, and she lacks internal contradiction or embodied cost. The "beautician mortician" label suggests a unique tension between cosmetic and cosmic work, but the story treats her purely as a high-fantasy weaver without exploring that specific dichotomy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("kindly decisive nature," "committed caretaker") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her "choice" to forgive feels predetermined and easy, devoid of the emotional friction required for a high-stakes literary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("monument to twenty years of rigid guilt") rather than embodied behavior. The dialogue feels therapeutic and instructional, with Elara functioning more as a thematic delivery system than a person with contradictory impulses. The emotional shift is rapid and lacks the friction of genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Character motivation is clear and the reverse-aging constraint is well-integrated into his worldview. However, interiority leans on diagnostic labeling of emotion ("peculiar cruelty," "overwhelming immediacy") rather than embodied sensation during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.0)
    Corbin functions as a consistent focalizer and his yearning is clear, but he lacks deep internal contradiction or resistance. His decision to merge with the canyon feels like an inevitable competence check rather than a high-stakes choice with a difficult, felt cost; the "decades of failure" are told in backstory rather than dramatized as present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and drives the narrative from dismissal to renewal. While her internal arc is clear, her emotional transition feels slightly idealized, lacking the gritty, contradictory friction of a higher-stakes struggle. The resolution of her "shame" occurs somewhat conveniently through the ritual with the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias has a clear motivation and backstory, but his defining traits are delivered through diagnostic labels ("shielded by his defining attribute") rather than dramatized behavior. The emotional pivot feels mechanical, as the internal shift occurs instantly upon reading a text rather than through a struggle with the suppression he values.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the story's high-concept premise than a living character; her motivation ("to wavelength align") is abstract and jargon-heavy. The internal conflict ("stellar doubt") is named but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible struggle, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. There is no felt cost to her alignment, only a shift in mood.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("profound heartbreak," "sorrow," "gratitude") rather than specific, contradictory embodiment. The "reaper" aspect feels largely cosmetic; his actions (operating a phonograph/prism) could belong to any mage archetype. The emotional arc is linear and lacks the friction of competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.0)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") rather than dramatized complexity. Elara’s internal state is asserted through adjectives; we are told her devotion is brittle, but her on-page actions show only competent, unwavering endurance without a moment of genuine struggle or near-failure to prove the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("precisely humane attribute") and summarized emotion ("visceral force," "pang of grief") rather than embodied experience. The internal conflict is resolved through asserted backstory rather than present-moment struggle, making the choice feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.4)
    Motivation is explicitly stated, but the pivotal epiphany is passive; the solution arrives via external coincidence (the murmuration) rather than character-driven agency or struggle. The "secretly sentimental" trait functions as a convenient bridge to the solution rather than a source of genuine internal friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is legible—restoring trust after a past failure—but the execution relies on stated emotion ("ghost in her tendons") rather than embodied reaction. The character feels like an archetype serving the plot; the interaction with Vance is mechanical and lacks genuine relational friction or distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist's motivation ("defeat numbness") is stated rather than dramatized through resistance; she succeeds instantly without behavioral struggle. The "ego death" trait functions as a label for detachment rather than a constraint that complicates the choice, leading to a frictionless resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or struggle; his "notably receptive spirit" allows him to resolve the central question instantly without friction. Motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The character functions primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and poignant, driving the ritualistic action effectively. However, the characterization relies heavily on repetitive descriptive labels ("mournfully eager") rather than purely dramatized struggle, making the internal state feel slightly asserted rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc is clear, and the choice to stay is motivated by the established "interiorizing" practice. However, the descriptor "feral" feels purely ornamental; the character acts with the calm, articulated philosophy of a Zen monk rather than the instinctual drive the label implies, creating a dissonance between the creature's design and its behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on contradictory labels ("stoically sensitive") and abstract summary ("despair rose," "surrendered") rather than embodied emotion or choice. The protagonist's transition from "hopeless" to masterful is instantaneous and unearned by previous struggle or specific flaw management.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is clear, but the internal conflict is resolved without significant resistance; Elara "discards assumptions" smoothly, lacking the visceral struggle of a difficult choice. Emotional states are often summarized with labels ("serene," "wonder") rather than embodied in specific, contradictory sensations. The character arc functions but feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo is defined by static labels ("ardent," "resiliently positive") rather than dramatized complexity. He faces the supernatural crisis with immediate, unwavering competence and no internal conflict or fear, resulting in a flat character arc where his specific traits function as plot coupons rather than human drivers.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara possesses a clear motivation ("texture of connection"), but she acts primarily as an observer rather than an agent of change. The climax—a magical eruption—happens to her rather than resulting from her choices, resolving her internal conflict through external force rather than earned character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("balancedly curious resolve," "disciplined wonder") rather than embodied action or struggle. Kael functions as a perfect mentor archetype without internal conflict or flaws, and Lyra's skepticism dissolves instantly without genuine resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara is a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character. Her defining trait, "persistently curious," is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through choices that carry risk or cost. Internal states are described with abstract labels ("hollow static," "quiet triumph") rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on emotional labeling ("reverence replacing fear," "bitter taste") rather than embodied reaction. The resolution of the internal arc is a "soft reset," where claustrophobia simply "dissolved into profound peace" without earned struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist is defined more by labels ("survivor," "wisdom") and abstract goals than by embodied agency or conflicting impulses. While the heartbeat counting offers a specific behavioral trait, her internal state is reported via metaphors ("ghost of her own erased life") rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional arc feels static, moving inevitably toward a pre-ordained epiphany without genuine internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a dramatic character; she encounters no hesitation, internal conflict, or meaningful cost. Her success is achieved through the seamless execution of a pre-formed plan, lacking the friction of a difficult choice or a renounced option.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s internal pivot relies on a sudden epiphany ("In that moment, Aris understood") rather than a dramatized struggle of competing values. While the backstory of "reputation in tatters" provides a baseline motive, the transition from skepticism to belief is smoothed over by the spectacle rather than earned through character agency under pressure. The "rigid walls around her heart" metaphor abstracts the emotional change rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara has a clear goal and plays an active role, but she functions more as an archetypal savior than a nuanced character. Her motivation is stated as a static trait ("quiet, persistent flame") rather than dramatized through conflicting internal desires or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kael is consistent but defined largely by summarized backstory and stated intent rather than complex, on-page psychology. The "broken promises" motivation is articulated directly to the reader ("His motivation burned within...") rather than emerging through behavior under pressure. His actions are noble but lack the friction or internal contradiction of a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a clearly defined focalizer with a specific skill set, but her internal arc resolves too smoothly. The transition from twelve years of silence to singing is catalyzed by finding a prop rather than a dramatized escalation of internal pressure or resistance. The grief feels asserted rather than felt through resistance in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to locate the tangible place") is abstract and lacks an embodied counter-weight or internal contradiction. The required trait "sanely eccentric" appears as a direct label rather than being dramatized through choice or behavior. The character functions largely as a vessel for the theme without facing a genuine dilemma or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on declared states ("dedicated keeper," "profound certainty") rather than dramatized internal conflict. Elara functions as a vessel for the ritual without distinct personality or contradictory impulses. The emotional resolution—a shift from longing to "peace"—feels unearned because the struggle is purely procedural, not psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, functioning solely to execute the plot's ritual. There is no internal conflict, doubt, or personal cost involved in his actions; his motivation is stated ("improbable longing") rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional arc is externalized entirely into the magical object, leaving the protagonist static.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is stated directly ("pure and personal") rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional resolution is summarized in abstract labels ("profound release") rather than embodied in specific behavior or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kael’s "shard-mirror" physicality and nervous habit of walking backwards offer distinct, grounded characterization that pays off at closure. However, the dialogue relies heavily on didactic, therapeutic aphorisms ("Resilience is not passive endurance") rather than subtextual interaction, making the characters feel like vehicles for a lesson rather than living people.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as an idealized archetype rather than a complex character, lacking internal contradiction or flaws. Motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("Her motivation burned with quiet urgency") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's internal state is conveyed through abstract labels ("fractured spirit," "lucid unrest") rather than dramatized behavior or resistance. The healing arc feels unearned, as the "mending" occurs automatically through the ritual without a personal sacrifice or difficult choice that tests her character.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized vessel for the theme rather than a character under pressure. Traits like "shielded openness" and "methodically curious" are delivered via diagnostic labels rather than dramatized choice or struggle. There is no internal contradiction or emotional cost; she moves through the investigation with perfect competence and correct feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and direct telling ("His motivation was deeply personal," "His quietly analytic nature... was his compass") rather than dramatized choice. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living agent; his traits are labeled rather than revealed through struggle or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as an idealized vessel for the premise rather than a character with internal contradictions or distinct desires. Her motivation is delivered through expository summary ("to articulate the unspoken needs"), and she faces no difficult choices that would reveal genuine character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clearly stated ("personal pilgrimage") but relies on exposition about a sick sister rather than dramatized struggle. His emotional journey is linear and frictionless, lacking the internal contradiction or cost required for higher marks.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris is a distinct protagonist whose professional expertise convincingly filters his grief. While the motivation to "prove empty spaces remember" is compelling, the specific trait "quietly explosive" is applied as a repetitive label rather than fully dramatized until the cathartic sob at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s tactile worldview is well-integrated, grounding her motivation and the plot’s turning point in a specific trait. However, the emotional shift from twenty years of obsession to acceptance feels rapid and slightly theoretical rather than viscerally struggled against. The epiphany relies on intellectual realization ("she understood") rather than a dramatized emotional cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist is functional but lacks depth; she faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine struggle. Her emotions are signaled via clichés ("pulse quickened," "tears welled") rather than embodied experience. She operates as a puzzle-solving vehicle without a distinct personality beyond the assigned labels.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a competent but static protagonist whose motivation is sentimental rather than urgent. Her internal state relies on poetic labels like "driftwood nostalgia" rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The lack of a genuine flaw or struggle makes the "tears of fulfillment" at closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on role-based epithets ("pragmatic engineer," "intuitive botanist") rather than behavior. There is no internal contradiction or friction; Kael's skepticism, the only potential source of interpersonal conflict, evaporates instantly upon finding the carvings. The group moves as a "single organism," denying the reader the specific, gritty texture of individual choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and poignant, anchored in the grandmother’s memory. However, she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her resignation to the end is total, making her an efficient vessel for the ritual rather than a struggling protagonist. The lack of hesitation or difficult micro-choices limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose reluctance provides a consistent filter for the narrative. Her internal state is well-embodied through the "offhandedly exact" physical actions, creating a character who lives through competence rather than just feeling. The tension between her desire to flee and her duty is resolved effectively through action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("symphonically minded," "chemist’s mind") rather than embodied experience. The emotional arc is linear and summary-driven, moving from grief to resolution without the internal resistance or contradictory impulses that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a philosophical cipher rather than a living protagonist; her "courage" is asserted in exposition rather than demonstrated through risk or struggle. Interiority relies on abstract summary ("quiet engine," "fragile spark") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses, leaving her motivation intellectually clear but emotionally distant.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aris functions primarily as a competent operator of the magic system rather than a character with deep internal contradictions; his "kitchen discipline" resolves the central struggle too smoothly, making his success feel inevitable rather than earned through character-specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a highly competent archetype without internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her "empathetically decisive nature" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through difficult choices. She faces no risk of failure, resolving the central crisis with instant proficiency, which prevents any deepening of character or felt cost. The emotional arc is sentimental and linear, lacking the friction of competing desires necessary for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara’s motivation is stated via exposition ("singular and profound") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. She faces no internal contradiction or resistance; her transition from engineer to mystic is seamless, lacking the psychological cost or doubt required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara is a competent archetype with a clear goal, but lacks internal contradiction or grit; her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The emotional arc is described via abstract metaphors ("anxiety into sharp readiness") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult micro-choices. The "failure" mentioned in backstory does not meaningfully pressure her decisions in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or contradiction; her motivation is stated ("gentle, persistent ache") rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional peak ("tears traced silent paths") feels unearned by prior difficulty, and her success is immediate and absolute without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The character is consistent, but his motivation is delivered via exposition ("stubborn drive to discover beauty") rather than emerging from a struggle on the page. The internal arc feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting impulses; he arrives seeking clarity and finds it without significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by a cluster of adjectival labels ("eclectic pacifist," "intuitively descriptive") rather than revealed through contradictory desires or difficult choices under pressure. Her empathy is absolute and effortless, lacking the internal friction or distinct limitations that create a credible human consciousness; she acts as a perfect vessel for the prompt rather than a character. There is no status dynamic or genuine interpersonal risk, rendering her "quiet obsession" abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on telling labels ("ambitious," "sensitive") rather than demonstrated action. The protagonist's arc from ambition to wisdom is summarized in a montage, lacking a dramatized turning point or a choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael functions as a camera for the setting rather than a conflicted protagonist. His motivation ("motivation burned clear") is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and his final decision to "protect" rather than "harvest" lacks weight because the temptation to harvest was never established as a viable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is a competent professional with clear motivation, and his backstory informs his actions. However, his emotional arc relies entirely on a highly improbable coincidence (finding a fellow flight engineer's patch), and his internal monologue frequently drifts into abstract thematic labeling ("terrestrial arrogance") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character; her motivation ("to certify wonder as essential") is abstract and philosophical rather than a grounded, urgent human desire. She faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice; she arrives, performs the ritual perfectly, and succeeds without wavering. The lack of distinct flaws or personal stakes beyond the abstract mission prevents emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.6)
    Kael's motivation is clear, but his interior arc relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("failure was not incompetence, but a deafness") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional resolution feels intellectualized and swift, lacking the visceral texture of genuine conflicted feelings under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("visceral resonance," "transposed empathy") rather than specific, embodied reaction. The emotional arc resolves via a toggle-like epiphany ("Lucid turbulence") rather than an earned decision, lacking the "visible cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist's transition from "jittery" to "mentor in the making" is unearned, relying on a magical object to instantly resolve internal conflict without behavioral struggle. Emotions are diagnosed via labels ("nervous energy," "profound calm") rather than embodied in action or complex psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is characterized primarily through functional labels ("mystic," "grounded") rather than demonstrated complexity. His epiphany relies on a convenient, undramatized memory recall rather than active struggle or character-specific logic, making the internal shift feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara is defined by labels ("profoundly wistful," "sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction or specific internal struggle. Her sacrifice feels inevitable and idealized rather than the result of a hard-fought decision between two valid, competing wants. The emotion is narrated via abstraction rather than dramatized through distinct behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("meek," "determined," "pure devotion") rather than demonstrated behavior. The pivotal internal conflict—the cost of the wife's memory—is summarized in backstory, rendering the emotional stakes abstract rather than felt in the moment. The protagonist’s transition from meekness to confidence feels unearned, appearing as an instantaneous result of the magic rather than a forged internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara has a distinct profession and goal, but her internal pivot—shifting from accusation to compassion—happens too smoothly without sufficient on-page resistance. The mentor character exists only as a vision, limiting the "relationship" dynamics to internal reflection rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a consistent, well-rendered archetype of the stoic maritime figure. The interiority effectively bridges his "reticent" nature with the "warmly observant" trait through specific notices (the teacup, dust). However, the motivation remains somewhat idealized and static; he faces no internal temptation to abandon the task, making his nobility feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, but his internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("shadowed elation," "poignant solitude") rather than embodied complexity. While the "accidentally prophetic" trait triggers the conflict effectively, the emotional reaction to the comic strip feels mechanically inserted to serve the plot rather than arising from a deep character need.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living character; her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("quietly explosive," "watchful anticipation") rather than embodied emotion. The central realization comes without struggle or active testing of her flaws, making the epiphany feel unearned. There is no visible cost paid for the insight, leaving the character arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is passive in the present moment; her primary effort (mapping dreams) occurs in backstory summary, leaving the on-page scene as a waiting game. There is no active choice under pressure that alters the outcome, only the observation of a ritual completion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype within the mythic mode, but her internal struggle is resolved too easily to generate deep engagement. The conflict between "scattered memory" and "purpose" dissolves the moment she begins the ritual, lacking the visceral push-and-pull of genuine psychological cost. Her transition from fragmented to whole feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her primary traits are conveyed through diagnostic labels ("keenly empathetic nature," "mistake born of misplaced trust") rather than dramatized behavior in the present. The internal conflict is resolved largely through external validation during the vision, rather than a difficult active choice that tests her character. Emotional states are described with abstract nouns ("regret," "empathy") rather than embodied physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("creeping normality noticer") rather than dramatized behavior. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Elara is a passive vehicle for the theme, and her emotional arc is resolved through external validation (the bread) rather than a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the premise rather than a conflicted character; she faces no internal opposition, and her primary trait ("gently meticulous") serves as a repeated label rather than a driver of costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara is competent, but her primary struggles are summarized rather than dramatized, distancing the reader from the difficulty of her choices. The climax relies on a convenient "detective reveal" (the blue dye) that feels unearned because the clues were not established in the narrative eye beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara’s skepticism is established via label ("fortress of doubt") rather than dramatized resistance, and she discards it instantly upon using the ring ("pushed past skepticism"). There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse acting in the scene; the transition from skeptic to believer is frictionless and unearned. The "luminous" trait is visual description but does not complicate her choices or social standing in this specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's emotions are labeled and performed ("grief-stricken desperation," "tears streamed freely") rather than embodied in contradictory actions. The internal state reads as diagnostic therapy-speak ("rectify the void," "uncork the suppressed wellspring") rather than a genuine human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s "wilting" trait effectively externalizes internal conflict, functioning as a unique compass. However, her motivation ("sought where lost conversations go") feels abstract, and her final evolution reads more as a philosophical pivot than a costly, earned character change derived from high-pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a reverent archetype rather than a fully realized protagonist; she encounters no internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choice. Her actions are purely procedural—adjusting and activating the sculpture—which reduces her role to a lever-puller for the theme rather than a character acting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit Seven is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear internal drive. However, the emotional arc relies on standard "robot with a soul" tropes without deeper subversion, and the translation of magnetic interference into human nostalgia feels slightly convenient rather than earned by character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.6)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character; her "quiet vow" is a thesis statement, not a human motivation. She lacks internal conflict or flaws, navigating the story with a perfect, unearned composure that reduces her to a "Mary Sue" archetype. The interactions feel performative, with no friction or genuine emotional cost to her character.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is abstract ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") and stated rather than demonstrated through high-stakes choices. While her internal state is described with rich metaphor, her shift from frustration to clarity feels procedural rather than psychologically earned. The character functions more as a lyrical vessel than a person making difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character with agency; her success in the climax relies on "pure intention" and convenient "sailor’s intuition" rather than a costly choice or struggle. The lack of internal conflict or contradictory impulses makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a magical technician rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or distinct personality traits beyond competence. Her actions encounter no internal resistance, and the "deep satisfaction" at the end is unearned by any personal cost or struggle. The narrative treats her as a vehicle for the magic system rather than a human subject under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara's internal shift from academic interrogation to empathetic stewardship is legible and complete, but the epiphany ("Tears welled") feels slightly unearned by the immediate scene pressure. Mrs. Davison functions more as a static vessel for wisdom than a character with distinct, conflicting needs, making the emotional transaction feel didactic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist's defining trait ("skeptic") is negated in backstory ("had been charmed into reluctant belief") rather than dramatized as an active, conflicting impulse in the scene. She performs the ritual with perfect competence and belief, lacking the internal friction or contradictory micro-choices required to make the "skeptic" label feel authentic or the emotional arc earned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kael’s internal state is summarized via abstract labels ("guilt," "sorrow," "profound peace") rather than embodied in specific, contradictory sensations. The emotional arc is linear and resolved through ritual mechanics rather than psychological struggle or decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Motivation is asserted via exposition ("fueled her motivation") rather than dramatized through conflict, and the protagonist lacks agency beyond obeying the magical object. Traits are applied as fixed labels ("richly perceptive") that dictate success without cost or internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or struggle. Her motivation is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her emotional state ("serene," "unburdened") remains static without embodying the cost of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("net-mender philosopher") rather than a character; he lacks internal contradiction, flaw, or genuine struggle. His motivation is stated abstractly ("sacred motivation") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. The "demure audacity" realization feels unearned because he faces no opposition or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation to debunk is established, but her pivot to guardianship relies on summary ("intuited the profound truth") rather than dramatized struggle. The shift from a career-long skeptic to a keeper of "sacred falsehoods" happens too smoothly, lacking the internal resistance or friction that would earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains an archetype defined by labels ("lonely visionary") rather than a specific psyche revealed through difficult micro-choices. The emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("wept," "sustained her") and summary rather than dramatized interiority under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("grief-stricken silence," "remorse") rather than embodied emotion or behavior under pressure. The protagonist is an idealized archetype who succeeds immediately without internal contradiction or struggle, resulting in a flat trajectory where feelings are explained to the reader rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara functions competently as a protagonist, but her defining trait ("logically emotional") is asserted via labels rather than emerging solely from subtext. Her motivation is clear but expressed through elevated, somewhat abstract internal monologue ("sacred trust etched into her bloodline") rather than grounded, distinct psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara’s internal conflict is labeled ("impatience hummed") and explained ("This internal forge was her motivation") rather than dramatized through erratic behavior or difficult choices. The struggle remains abstract, resolved by a simple refocusing of attention, which lowers the sense of embodied character risk.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is defined primarily through diagnostic labels ("watchful calm," "preventable death investigator") rather than dramatized complexity. While her motivation is clear, her agency is undermined when she receives the solution via psychic vision rather than earning it through the established "empirical" traits. The emotional arc relies on summary ("emotional drought was ending") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias acts primarily as a passive vessel for guilt, observing rather than driving the resolution. His internal state is conveyed through melodramatic descriptors ("sacred relic," "physical echo") rather than dramatized through complex choices or conflicting drives.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("ring a bell") but the struggle is summarized ("oil-stained triumphs") rather than dramatized, reducing emotional weight. The protagonist lacks a moment of costly choice or renunciation, making the success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with a clear goal, but her characterization relies heavily on summary (e.g., "deeper motivation burned quietly") and labeled traits rather than dramatized complexity. The emotional peak feels performed ("tears traced Elara’s cheeks") rather than embodied, and her internal state lacks the contradictory impulses that create depth.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the prompt's labels rather than a living character. Motivation is explicitly stated ("not prophecy, but purpose") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the "calmly intuitive" nature precludes the internal conflict or doubt necessary for a 600-word arc. The lack of any emotional or physical cost renders the peacekeeper an invincible avatar.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for poetic musing than a character with embodied agency. Her emotions are delivered via abstract labels ("quiet curiosity," "no isolation, only belonging") rather than dramatized behavior, and the pivotal internal shift relies on a convenient external trigger (the journal) rather than psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara functions as a plot device rather than a character, delivering diagnostic dialogue ("intersubjective understanding") that breaks naturalism. Uncontrolled head-hopping into Clara and Liam’s internal memories dilutes the POV, and the reconciliation lacks psychological realism or earned emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist acts as a functional archetype for a ritual vignette rather than a fully realized character. His traits, such as being "strangely honest," are stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices or conflict. While interiority is present, it feels performative ("flowed not from pride but reverence") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as an idealized archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, struggle, or flaws. Her interactions are devoid of friction, as her mere presence and method instantly resolve deep-seated trauma without requiring her to make difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his motivation is stated ("driven by a deep motivation") rather than dramatized through struggle. Emotional states are labeled ("profound peace," "weathered innocence") rather than embodied in complex action. The character functions as a passive vessel for the theme rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a compelling archetype with a distinct objective, and her ritualistic devotion is clear. However, her motivation is often communicated through abstract labels ("quiet reverence," "tidal longing") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or behavior that contradicts her internal state. The "precognitively forgetful" trait is a strong concept but functions primarily as a setup for imagery rather than a constraint that forces tactical improvisation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation ("harness the ephemeral"), but her interiority leans on "sage" archetypes rather than specific, contradictory struggle. The resolution—a shift to "empathy" triggered by a leaf—feels more like a thematic convenience than a character-driven choice forged in pressure, lacking a visible personal cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on idealized archetypes rather than human complexity; Elara is a functional "angelic helper" without internal contradiction, flaws, or doubt. The emotional responses of Arthur and Lena are generic and immediate, lacking the friction or resistance that creates authentic character depth. Motivation is stated via exposition ("motivation was singular and profound") rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara functions efficiently as a competent protagonist, but lacks internal struggle or depth beyond the "scholar" archetype. Her reaction to the climax ("She had anticipated this") removes the potential for doubt or difficult choice, reducing her agency to executing a pre-planned checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is clearly defined, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract self-labeling ("forgiving skeptic," "shrewdly innocent") rather than dramatized complexity. The transition from grief to "liberation" feels rushed and slightly unearned, reading more as a thematic pivot than a genuine emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her resolve is instant and static, making her a functional vehicle rather than a struggling protagonist. Interiority relies on abstract diagnostic summaries ("tangible metaphor for shedding fear") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("quietly proactive," "honor the truth") rather than embodied emotion or conflicting impulses. The internal arc is summarized via self-analysis ("grafted a new truth") rather than dramatized through struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the concept, observing rather than engaging in dramatic choice. His internal conflict—hope vs. nihilism—is summarized in exposition rather than enacted through difficult trade-offs or behavioral contradictions. The character remains static, functioning more as a recording device than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a ceremonial vehicle rather than a character with internal life; her "tinkerer" persona is defined solely by props (gears, spectacles) that do not influence her actions (singing). There are no micro-choices or moments of doubt; she performs a rehearsed ritual perfectly, lacking the internal contradiction or struggle required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara is competent and focused, serving as a clear vessel for the ritual. However, she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful struggle; her choices are procedural steps rather than difficult dilemmas, resulting in a character who feels more functional than alive.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael is competent and the locksmith persona drives the action, but his characterization relies heavily on expository telling ("Kael’s motivation was not professional pride"). He lacks internal conflict or a "crucible" moment where his conviction is tested by a difficult choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a functional, consistent protagonist with a distinct "fractal weaver" persona. However, her interiority relies on a convenient backstory beat (fear of abandonment) introduced solely to solve the immediate scene problem, rather than presenting a deep, contradictory struggle. The emotional cost is stated ("solitude") rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.4)
    The character is consistent but defined largely by narrator summary ("nature was hauntingly practical") rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her internal state is explained via diagnostic labels ("understood containment," "motivation was clear") rather than embodied, resulting in a static emotional arc with no risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("to negotiate"), but the protagonist faces no resistance from the antagonist (the ghost), making the emotional resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("curious," "stoic," "functionally creative attribute") rather than dramatized behavior.

The motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") and lacks embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist’s internal desire is legible, but the resolution relies on a diagnostic realization ("She understood") rather than a dramatized shift in behavior. The transition from regret to peace feels instantaneous and unearned, lacking the "struggle" required for high-band characterization. The emotional arc is told through adjectives rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("errant legend seeker," "guardian of authenticity") rather than demonstrated traits. The pivotal emotional shift is driven by a convenient epiphany regarding the sundial rather than a pressured internal conflict or decision. Motivation is stated directly in exposition ("to understand the architecture of lies") rather than emerging from behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on explicit labels ("philosophical seed collector," "infinitely patient") rather than behavior; there is no internal conflict or embodied emotion to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as an observer rather than a protagonist with competing desires; her motivation is abstract ("sacred," "geography of healing") rather than visceral. Kael appears solely as a wisdom-dispensing device to validate her internal monologue, lacking independent agency or friction. There is no internal contradiction or struggle; she seeks answers and receives them without emotional cost or error.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation and internal conflict are legible, and the shift from obsession to acceptance is a clear arc. However, the emotional resolution leans on summary and epiphany ("transformed by acceptance," "profound gratitude") rather than dramatized struggle in the final moments. The transition to "resonant peace" feels slightly hurried and idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on label-only feelings ("unyielding compassion," "grace born of vigilance") rather than embodied emotion or internal struggle. The protagonist arrives with a resolved duality ("sought to harmonize") and executes a plan without hesitation, lacking the contradictory impulses required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on the label "luminous skeptic," which is repeated three times but contradicted by the protagonist's immediate, unquestioning faith in a magical ritual. There is no internal conflict or embodied emotion; Elara functions solely as a procedural vehicle for the fetch quest. The "skepticism" is never dramatized through choice or hesitation, making the trait feel like an unearned prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as an archetype of maternal devotion rather than a complex character; her interiority consists of abstract metaphors ("woven from starlight") rather than specific, embodied emotion. There is no internal contradiction or hesitation to drive the narrative, as she performs her function perfectly without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated ("profound need"), but her agency is undercut when the spectral mentor provides the solution. Key traits appear as expository labels ("fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized behaviors under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions more as a vehicle for the theme than a living character, with the trait "ethically diligent" applied as a static label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a living character; her internal conflict (doubt) is resolved instantly by a rational check of data ("rigorous reckoning"), lacking genuine emotional cost or struggle. The "doubt" feels like a label rather than an embodied experience, and her "prevailing" is a summary of a mental state rather than a dramatized choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich, and her transition from copyist to "gardener of ghosts" provides a clear, resonant reconfiguration of identity. The motivation is explicitly stated rather than purely dramatized through friction, and the "thistled calm" contradiction feels more like a label than a lived struggle under pressure. However, her dedication is palpable, and the final shift in stance is earned by the accumulative weight of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is abstract and she faces no internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices. The lack of genuine struggle or personal cost makes her role feel like a functional archetype (the wise artisan) rather than a living protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the central choice, but relies heavily on expository summary ("His motivation was crystalline") rather than dramatized desire.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions as a consistent thematic anchor, but the emotional journey relies on labeled internal states ("expectantly resigned," "quiet awe") rather than embodied contradiction.

They practiced subtracting noise") rather than through a dramatized pressure-cooker moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his journey is a linear execution of a task without hesitation or significant emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)

    Elara functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character; her motivation is stated ("to understand") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a complex character; her motivation is stated as a "thesis" rather than a felt drive with internal contradiction. The emotional arc is frictionless—she hopes, she acts, she is confirmed—lacking the "lived cost" or genuine doubt required for high-band characterization. The moment of "profound confirmation" feels unearned because her interiority is delivered through abstract labels ("visceral warmth," "quiet dignity") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a plot device rather than a complex character, with traits like "profoundly historically oriented" delivered via diagnostic labeling rather than action. Her knowledge of the community's oral history ("The leaf remembers...") exceeds that of the elders for the sake of a convenient solution, and the emotional shift from "frozen hearts" to "resolute nod" feels unearned and rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.7)
    Leeward is a distinct, competent protagonist with clear motivation, but he lacks internal conflict or a moment of doubt. The narrative relies on his absolute mastery, resulting in a performance of skill rather than a struggle requiring sacrifice or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in the backstory of the lost expedition.

The "quietly driven" attribute is stated rather than dramatized through struggle against active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("stoically sensitive," "reverence") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's "internal wrestling" is stated in summary rather than shown through conflicting choices or on-page hesitation.

The character functions primarily as a vehicle for the procedural plot without distinct voice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara is defined by diagnostic labels ("crafty," "resolve") rather than embodied behavior under pressure. Her interiority is summarized through poetic abstraction ("world had shrunk to the size of her grief") rather than concrete, specific thought processes. The lack of a difficult on-page choice flattens the character arc into a procedural execution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority relies on melodramatic abstractions ("shattered her wedding day into smoke and silence") rather than specific, embodied memory. The emotional shift at the end feels processed through a therapeutic lens rather than earned through dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation ("to decode the frequency of belonging") relies on abstract label-speak rather than embodied desire, and the romantic connection at the closure feels unearned by prior interaction. Elara functions as a flat mirror with a single repeated trait ("perpetually surprised") rather than an agent with distinct interiority. The emotional progression jumps from professional focus to profound intimacy without sufficient on-page development.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("guilt-ridden," "tempered regret") rather than embodied emotion.

The epiphany feels mechanically triggered by a prop rather than organic psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias functions more as a thematic observer than an active agent; his internal state is summarized through abstract assertions ("aching liminal space") rather than dramatized through immediate struggle.

While the central flaw is clear, the resolution leans on a rapid, somewhat tidy psychological pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("epitome of a clean slate seeker," "calculated betrayals") rather than dramatized behavior. The "ghost" of the past manifests only as a somatic cliché (tremor) and a stated void, missing the opportunity to show the struggle through specific interactions or failures. The emotional transition is summarized rather than earned through a difficult, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle is summarized through abstract labels ("reluctant metamorphosis," "hollow space") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is abstract ("texture of transformation") and relies on diagnostic labels ("destitute philanthropist") rather than embodied desire or specific need.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a complex character.

The lack of on-page cost or difficult choices leaves him feeling like a generic archetype of the "quiet rebel."

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s internal landscape is described rather than dramatized; emotions are signaled through stock physical cues ("tears welling," "single tear"). While her motivation is clear, the "elusive" trait is told via exposition rather than demonstrated in scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara reads as a thematic archetype rather than a living person; her interiority relies on abstract labels ("pressure of unuttered truths") rather than specific, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.0)
    Elara is defined by high-concept labels ("dueling philosopher," "diplomatically fierce") rather than dramatized behavior; because she is alone, her diplomatic fierceness is told rather than shown against opposition.

The internal monologue is abstract, prioritizing philosophical posturing over embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara functions primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a fully realized character; her internal conflict is stated ("vulnerability that tightened her chest") but resolved instantly by external reassurance without genuine psychological struggle. The "Silas" persona is an intriguing concept that is told rather than shown, and the transition between selves lacks the visceral, embodied cost required for this level of stakes. The resolution relies on a "wise mentor" intervention that bypasses the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on prompt-inserted labels ("strategically creative," "steely longing") rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Character interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("empirical mind," "whimsical heart") rather than embodied struggle, making the internal conflict feel diagrammatic.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s shift from cosmic detachment to humble attentiveness is embodied in repeated micro-choices (returning with magnifying glass, leaving the leaf untouched). Interiority stays concrete—physics metaphors filter perception without slipping into jargon. The final renunciation of “preprocessing” is earned through daily dust observations that visibly cost him time and certainty. Only minor slip: grandmother’s voice is recalled, not dramatized, so the memory feels slightly convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “steadily adaptive resilience” is asserted repeatedly yet never dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her anything. The decision to glass-encase the ledger is narrated as inevitability, not a live tension between destroy/transform. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“purpose crystallized”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s muteness is embodied through gesture and gaze; the fork-in-hand calibration of emotion to color shows micro-choices under pressure. Liam enters as mirror-trauma, but his arc is sketched more than dramatized—only one shared beat rewrites his stance. The earned cost is present: silence retained, connection forged without reclaiming noise. Missing a second turning beat from Liam keeps it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet vow and stubborn refusal to catalog the lens as salvage anchor every subsequent choice; his interior contradiction—preserver of silence who now re-ignites voices—plays out in embodied, micro-choices (tightening fingers, sliding shards). The final renunciation of “chased stillness” for “cherished stillness” is earned through visible cost: decades of fatigue crystallized in the single gesture of turning off his lamp. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount is within default. Voice remains consistent and particular to a lifelong archivist of the drowned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority blends memory and duty in the quiet arbor, her gestures (ribbon-slow, bell-kiss) revealing a layered hierarchy of values—survival, secrecy, generational covenant—earned through repeated night runs. The micro-choice to sound the bell at a whisper crystallizes contradiction: she both breaks and preserves silence, cost visible in Lena’s tear and Lin’s weathered nod; yet the story keeps her flaw safely offstage, softening the final edge.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—breath, scent, warmth of Kwan Yin’s tear—but the contradiction that would force a visible gamble is missing; she never risks anything tangible, so the “cost” is purely lyrical. Micro-choices (tilting the crystal, exhaling) are present yet interchangeable; any could be swapped without altering outcome. Still, the voice-specific noticing and the final stance shift feel earned within the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-riven obsession is palpable in embodied micro-gestures (tracing the “nearly blank photograph,” the ivy-tightening chest). The retrocognitive trap is shown, not labeled, and her surrender to the garden’s geometry feels inevitable. One minor slip: “quaking reverie” edges toward diagnostic self-tag at climax, blunting the pure embodied beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s patient vigilance is credibly rooted in embodied ritual (the arrow, the keys) and her final “staggering grace” stance feels earned by twelve years of solitude. The interior contradiction—chain as prison vs. root—is dramatized only in the last paragraph; earlier beats summarize rather than show simultaneous impulses. Micro-choices are present (lifting the false bottom, pressing the arrow) but lack immediate opposing pull, so the chain never truly tests her tactics until the symbol flips at the end. Still, the renunciation of force and the visible crew bow supply sufficient cost to clear the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation (finding the sound of trust breaking) is declared but never dramatized in-scene; we only get summary of past collection and abstract exhalation in the forge. Interiority is overwritten with “battered marvel,” “silence’s sacred geometry,” etc. that reads like therapy-speak, not embodied crisis. No contradictory micro-choice undercuts her plan; she simply pours absences and receives enlightenment without cost or error. The end-state is asserted, not earned by causality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from thief to participant is embodied in the tactile re-weaving of the bouquet; the tear of awe and the choice to walk into the forest rather than board the train show a visible, scaled cost. Interiority is concrete—her breath catching, the jar’s glow against her palm—avoiding label-speak. The single-scene constraint keeps supporting cast off-page, so relationship bullets are waived; motive stays character-bound and intensifies to the final renunciation. Competence balanced with struggle: she mis-read the code at noon, pays with years of silence, and the corrected reading still demands she abandon the safe platform.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the cracked-bookmark micro-choice at the fracture beat cleanly tilts her renunciation. The glass-work narration externalizes contradictory impulses (perfectionism vs acceptance) without therapy-speak. Final “abandon” lands with felt cost: she forfeits hours of labor and ego investment. Voice-specific perceptual signature sustains across the single POV.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (“knuckles white against the rusted iron shelf”) and drives the rooftop choice; her shift from exploited double to protective mentor is credibly forced by Lily’s peril. Interiority occasionally drifts into self-diagnosis (“she had woven its hyper-awareness into their salvation”) but contradictory impulses coexist in the moment of deciding to climb. Micro-choices—etching the shell, leading Lily upward—trace a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost. The bond with Lily is forged through shared fragility rather than convenience, satisfying the relationship-as-crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—obsession with silence yet yearning to give it form—drives every micro-choice; the obsidian stylus tremble and flake-catching digit embody embodied emotion. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; her sole-on-stage endurance is credible. Reflection stays under 20 % and is tethered to present cues (shattered gold becomes ink). The final renunciation—closing the booklet at dawn—carries visible cost: the star fades, her vigil ends, the path of endless charting foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Unit Seven’s quest to locate the origin of thought is cleanly dramatized through the ice-violin beats; the robot’s “remarkably composed” trait is repeatedly tested yet never breaks, so the interior contradiction feels thin. Because the loop resets every seventeen minutes, stakes never compound—no tool lost, no social credit burned—so the final “earned stasis” reads more like serene stasis than costly renunciation. Still, the perceptual signature (optical sensors, archival delicacy) stays specific, and the amalgamation choice is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is consistently grounded in sensory action (lens-weighing, ticket-collecting), and her final projection choice carries visible relational cost when Kael steps into light. “Passive observation was complicity” crystallizes motive, yet the beat remains one-note; no contradictory impulse complicates her arc. Kael’s single tear and palm-press are sufficient embodied change, but his silence still reads as convenient rather than pressured flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—veined hands, soil-over-silicon creed, marble ritual—yet her one on-page decision (pressing the cobalt sphere) is causally thin; Kael’s panic does the heavy lifting. The final vow lands as earned stasis, but the contradictory impulse (risk expulsion vs. protect garden) is asserted rather than dramatized in her body. Still, the specificity of cracked-glass chronicles and breath-synced polish keeps her above stock sage.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s quiet obsession and mechanical competence are credibly embodied; the final silent communion with the zephyrs shows earned renunciation of pride in favor of listening. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of doubt before lever-pull is slightly under-dramatized—an extra contradictory impulse in that beat would have secured 9+. Character-bound knowledge holds; no label-speak. Closure cost is felt in the shift from proof to reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s obsession is palpable through the cello-worn fingers and nightly returns; the moment he chooses to play the flood-scored phrase, a visible cost (the chill, the lantern’s steadying) locks the arc. Interiority stays embodied—no therapy labels—and the final renunciation (leaving without looking back) is earned by the duet he has just completed. Micro-choices (balancing the program, tracing stains, sustaining the fermata) knit motive to action. Only the “lately inspired” tag surfaces twice without fresh friction, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt-driven search is embodied in every beat; the tear darkening the smudge makes remorse tactile. Her shift from oracle-certainty to margin-trusting witness is credibly costly. Interiority stays concrete—”cold, dense stone of remorse” not therapy labels. Only the twenty-year backstory capsule feels told, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—each physical interaction with the beaded wheel refracts Leo’s skepticism, grief, and filial loyalty. The drowsy-alert POV keeps thought under bodily stress, avoiding self-diagnosis, and the contradictory impulses—pride in rationalism vs. need for paternal vindication—collide in the final hand-turn with audible cost. Micro-choices (crunching steps, light-glint, bead-to-iron click) choreograph values clearly. The only drag: the grandfather remains off-page, so status/relationship pressure is second-hand, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is poetically specific (“gripped reality loosely” felt as damp chill), but her sole agency is witnessing; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice heightens cost. The ending renunciation is gentle and thematically apt, yet forecloses no path we saw her tempted by. Interior texture is rich, but motivation stays static; no visible flaw complicates her ritual. Earned stasis lands, but without an earlier fork, the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “quiet vow” is dramatized through the micro-choice of mirroring Liam’s breath and surrendering the curl. The moment she places the curl in his palm crystallizes a contradictory impulse: relinquish the anchor to gain the link. Liam’s shift from dust-staring to tear-tracked awe is rendered through visible bodily change, not label-speak. Cost is legible: she permanently shares her private relic, foreclosing sole possession.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“constant hum beneath his skin”); micro-choice of sealing the case costs him the tactile connection he covets, earned by diary’s last line. No contradictory impulse on-page keeps him from 9+. Sensory empathy is shown, not labelled; historian’s refusal to surrender fragment to flames is credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s regret-to-reconciliation arc is anchored in tactile ritual (gull-counting, stone-keeping) and a visible micro-choice to speak the apology aloud; the moment he presses the stone back into her palm crystallizes earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“breath catching,” “tears blurred”) rather than diagnostic. Daughter Elara functions as crucible: her single line forces Silas’s renunciation of covert manipulation, sealing the duet. No contradiction or label-speak harms the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his bones vibrate with shockwaves, his foot on the pedal is a censer—and every question he asks is a micro-choice that tightens the noose of her assumption. Elara’s contradictory impulses (cling to cobalt vs. reach for spectrum) are dramatized in the single tear and the palette latch; the cost is the visible tremor in her hand and the released sob. The only minor drag is a faint whiff of therapist-speak in “You assumed solitude was strength,” but it is immediately grounded by the palette click, so the flaw stays sub-threshold for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulse—grief for lost time vs. need to master it—drives every micro-choice; the shell-mapping baton swing is embodied, specific, irreversible. Exhaustion cost is viscerally legible, anchoring transformation. Interiority avoids label-speak; “chronological homesickness” is shown via sensory recall, not named ache. Only flaw: no second character on stage keeps relationship crucible and status shift bullets inert, capping max. 8.8 unattained.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—gravity-defiance as both rebellion and self-punishment—are dramatized in every beat; the micro-choice to drop the tablet with acceptance rather than despair is the earned culmination of prior causality and carries visible cost (“I accept all that I am”). Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapeutic gloss even at the climax. The only micro-slip is a single phrase—“fractured reflections of who she might have been”—that flirts with abstraction, but it is immediately re-embodied in the walk along crystallized laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—grief embodied in the snapped needle, micro-choice to open her palm, credible shift from frost to “vibrant, humming aliveness.” The 30-year deafness backstory is a single reflective block that tilts present stance and primes the drum choice; no diagnostic self-label mid-crisis. Status with Kael is legible through silent exchange, but relationship pressure is gentle—more conduit than crucible—so the change feels personal rather than inter-personal. Still, the cost is visible: she leaves carrying the re-needled drum, silence now re-stitched into her ribs—Earned Stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is tightly filtered through her professional lens; every beat (still fingers, deliberate calm, logging serenity) externalizes her methodological integrity. The crimson-clay vial turn proves she’s willing to pay the quiet cost of keeping records rather than burning them—an earned renunciation that closes her arc. Micro-choices (performance of normalcy, margin-note cipher) show contradictory impulses—fear vs. discipline—without slipping into explanatory labels. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the table, but the self-as-crucible is fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—professional control of light vs. terror of scent-triggered memory—drives every beat; the micro-choice to uncork the vial under UV is earned. Embodied grief is visceral (“tears… scattering crystalline shadows”). The vial’s revealed inscription reweights her vocation, but the pivot from “wistful broker” to “story-broker” is declared more than dramatized; a sharper visible cost (e.g., a client she’ll lose) would clinch 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    The poet’s “ethically playful” nature is shown through his refusal to destroy the rope—an embodied micro-choice that crystallizes his values. Interiority stays concrete (“he was brushing against time’s fabric”) and the final renunciation carries visible cost (he forgoes the descent). The only drag is a brief slide into diagnostic summary (“his motivation warred with his ethics”) just before the third-path invention; tightening that beat would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s acoustic sensitivity is not a label—it drives every micro-choice: she kneels to the soil to “hear” roots, inverts the bowl to listen, selects the lowest string first. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. awe) coexist inside one continuous beat, embodied in ash-tears that are “not grief, but awe.” The final endurance—leaving the bowl, accepting incomplete beauty—costs her the safety of silence; the hush becomes companion, not enemy, foreclosing retreat. Interiority stays concrete, sensorial, and character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—detached technician vs. aching human—are dramatized in the single, embodied moment he presses the petal to his wrist; the raw tears that follow retroactively validate every calibrated micro-choice and renounce his former identity with undeniable cost. No stock interiority, no amnesia of competence; even the “static” sense is a lived, character-specific organ. The earned bridge persona at the end is the only possible synthesis of the traits shown. High-band gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s shrewd-cargo-broker lens surfaces in the locket discovery beat, but interior contradiction is told (“motivation crystallized instantly”) rather than enacted. Elara remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is Liam-Elias; their status shift from strangers to co-conspirators is credible, yet Liam’s voice converges toward Elias’s diction under stress. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when Elias seals the note, accepting the risk of sentiment overtaking pragmatism, but the cost is asserted, not felt. Character bounds hold; no knowledge leaks, and the Earned Stasis renunciation (returning the locket before opening) is properly foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rootlessness vs. hunger for belonging—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of release-by-wind is earned through the shared search with Kael. The “boldly sympathetic” trait manifests as on-page risk (offering partnership, kneeling to dedicate). Only minor slip: Kael’s fifty-year backstory is told, not dramatized, slightly thinning pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s childhood obsession, tactile ritual with the pendant, and decisive sculpting of borrowed time give interiority and embodied stakes; the mother-lullaby memory lands as earned cost. Yet no contradiction or flaw complicates her success—she executes flawlessly, so the “genuine struggle” criterion thins and the arc feels triumphant rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s quietly burning quest to “understand the mathematics of emotion” is stated early and links every beat; her interiority is concrete (“a single tear traced a warm path”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails, but the earned renunciation of grief is credible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, anchored in sensory memory and embodied ritual; her contradictory impulses—yearning for invisibility yet choreographing a dawn reveal—collide in the moment she steps into light. The micro-choice to place the fragment where the first sunbeam will strike is both methodical and vulnerably human, scaling cost to length. Evans’ recognition supplies external confirmation, but the earned change is Elara’s own renunciation of erasure. Minor skim: “quiet intensity” borders label-speak, but the body-of-action quickly re-anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction—control vs surrender—plays out in live gesture (hand tightens while praising trust). The final renunciation is earned: twenty years of frantic repair collapse into one tactile release of the leaf. Micro-choice tracked throughout (return leaf, plant hostas beneath new shade) makes the shift legible and irreversible. Cost is felt in the relinquished habit of command; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s insomnia, brooch-totem, and painterly lens are tightly braided; every beat filters through his exhausted perception and the amber weight on his cuff. The renunciation of the brooch lands as earned cost because seventeen years of vigilant sleeplessness have inscribed the object with survivor’s guilt. Interiority stays concrete—“salt and fear as waves rose” bodies emotion without label-speak. Only the moment he “understood his insomnia was not a curse” flirts with self-diagnosis, blunting full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation—compassion as communal resilience—remains steady and is viscerally tested when she surrenders foresight; the pilgrim is a silent catalyst, not a crucible, so relationship/status pressure is absent. Interiority is concrete (“anxiety fractured her serene mask”), but the embodied cost is muted: her trembling hand is never mentioned again, so the renunciation feels more conceptual than corporeal. The earned change—trusting the unknown—lands cleanly, yet the prior flaw (blind clairvoyance) is stated, not dramatized in an earlier failure, trimming full believability.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s exile-grief and reactively-visionary gift are embodied in salt-stung shawl, calloused thumb, the micro-choice to oil the valve; contradictory impulses—fear of vision vs hunger to repair—drive each beat. Final renunciation (trumpet as healing signal, not fanfare) is earned by the prior cleansing labor and costs her the nostalgic sound she craves. Interiority avoids label-speak; “phantom chill of that silenced sound” is concrete, contradictory, particular. Only cap keeps it from 9: second-character pressure (Elder Lin) is brief, status shift light; still, protagonist alone carries sufficient crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s cartographer-persona is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to surrender the vellum map carries palpable cost, earning the decisive shift to self-acceptance. Interior contradiction is shown (“violent tremor… trembling certainty”) rather than told, anchoring her flaw. The absence of on-page secondary characters keeps status/relationship bullets inert, but single-POV depth sustains pressure. Slight over-articulation of epiphany (“the fortress… was the sanctuary within her spirit”) edges toward diagnostic summary, holding the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. the need to comfort Liam—play out in real time through the tactile choice to place the tile; her tear-streaked transcription embodies the cost. Interiority is concrete, body-bound, and stakes scale to the sanctuary she must now guard. Only a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“skepticism bowed”) keeps her just shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s millennia-scale ennui is asserted more than embodied; we hear “ten thousand years of solitude” twice but never witness a concrete tick or tremor that proves boredom fracturing under pressure. The moment of intrigue—tears after ten millennia—lands as label, not embodied contradiction. Interiority leans on grand abstracts (“burning quest,” “fragile ember”) rather than character-particular perception. The final smile is unearned because no prior micro-choice risks or costs him anything; the story skips from entry to epiphany without a legible decision path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to Silas vs. revulsion at his lies—stay active in-scene (ink pot as catalyst, hands on corpse). The final integration offer is earned by prior causal chain; cost is felt in the promise to “redact names,” a concrete forfeiture. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic. Only cap keeps this from 9+: no second on-page character to test status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s devotion to “invented histories” is anchored in tactile ritual—every charcoal stroke on the hum-chart is a micro-choice that costs her dawn-light minutes and the solitude she refuses to trade. The interior contradiction is visible: she both mourns and feeds on absence, a tension held in her refusal to sell the finished leaf. Earned stasis lands when she closes the pad on “texture: peace,” accepting that her archive will never be touched by another hand. Voice specificity slips once into diagnostic abstraction (“her work embodied incandescent restraint”), but body, tool, and silence keep her credible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nameless archivist’s hunger for “texture of memories” is visceral and consistent; every micro-choice—smoothing the aconite label, layering fragments in the tin—embodies his trait. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation—accepting perpetual namelessness while anchoring another’s erased life—carries visible cost in the closing image. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—ruthless empiricist vs. grieving granddaughter—coexist in the same beats (“gloomy cheerfulness”), and her micro-choice to retell the past with the cello visibly tilts her hierarchy of values. The cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of permanent truth for the ache of transient love. The only restraint from 9-band is that the internal shift is almost entirely interior; no external behavior (posture, breath-rate, grip) varies to dramatize the final relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—order vs intuition—surfaces early and steers every graffiti decision; the stone chip anchors lineage pressure. Yet his emotional register stays cerebral; we’re told “hopeful desperation” rather than shown body-level cost. The final smile feels earned but lightweight because no personal stake (job, safety, reputation) is risked on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s grief-anchored resolve is concrete—spilling the sand, the tear, the final look—yet the interiority flirts with sentimental summary (“profound silence,” “quiet dignity”) that blunts contradictory impulse. The micro-choice of sealing the grain back over the heart crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test even if the beat leading up to it leans on abstract rather than bodily tension.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s tactile perception of metal fatigue and her refusal to "guess" give her credible artisan authority; the quiet sovereignty stance, however, edges toward idealization rather than flaw. No interior contradiction surfaces once pressure rises—the calm never cracks—so the arc is less a change than a demonstration. Still, micro-choices (warming resin, tracing the joint) embody motive cleanly and the release beat carries felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test enough for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—map-maker who disowns maps—drives every beat; the atlas-editor profession filters every perception, from frost-feather cipher to river-source obsession. Motivation stays concrete: “rebellion against atlases that mapped symptoms while ignoring origins” (37) and crystallizes into tomorrow’s drill. Micro-choices—thumb to dog-ear, palm to vibrating glass—embody stakes without label-speak. The falcon rapport supplies external pressure, but secondary-character headcount stays safe; cost is felt in the unspoken forfeiture of her former life.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s infinite patience is dramatized through the slow footfall ritual and the refusal to rush; the cost is her silence absorbed into the stones, a credible renunciation. Interiority is sparse but embodied in tactile rhythm, never label-speak. No contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails; cap 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s contradictory impulses—urgent survival vs. reverent patience—are dramatized in micro-choices (finger extended “with the deliberate slowness of geological time”). The final renunciation costs his life, but the interiority flirts with therapy-speak: “panic was a luxury he could not afford” is label-adjacent and keeps this just outside 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—shame-driven quiet versus the need to be heard—stay active in-scene; the micro-choice to place the lattice over the scuffs crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him the last of his anonymity. Twenty-year patience feels lived-in; the tear on Elias’s cheek is the on-page proof of absolution. Interiority avoids label-speak; “legacy of lies clinging to his name like salt-rime” is embodied, not diagnostic. Final grip of absolution is earned, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interior contradiction and embodied cost—her “lovingly venomous” touch shows poison-as-nurture in one gesture. Motivation remains ancient-debt simple, but the micro-choice to pour her last essence into the Heartwood is earned and irreversible. Flaw: no second voice on stage limits relationship crucible; still, the single-POV arc is tight and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly internalized—her sleepwalking feet “learning the stone’s language” shows embodied contradiction—but the arc is essentially a single, foreordained ritual; no micro-choice undercuts or complicates her resolve, so the “cost” feels symbolic rather than personally transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the quiet ache of exile is repeatedly tether to tactile acts (trowel, moss, gnomon-carving). One flaw: the emotional crescendo is slightly over-articulated—“faith reborn not as blind certainty, but as conscious choice” tells us the calibration we already see in the tear and the hum against stone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and particular; the clipboard and chalk code act as embodied emotional catalysts. The final micro-choice—renaming “Aurora”—is earned by the prior deciphering beat and carries visible cost (abandoning Lyra/Corbin). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only sequential reflection, keeping this just below 9. Still, the motivation arc is coherent, personal, and tightly scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s placid-mad façade creates crisp interior contradiction that powers every beat; the embroidery-needle micro-choices show hierarchy of values under rising risk. The final quiet delivery costs her visibility yet saves the realm—Earned Stasis with felt price. Motivation (“listen for unheard stories”) drives discovery and final tactic; no competence overreach. Only minor gap: coup consequence for her remains off-stage, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s regret is embodied from the first line and drives every step; the shard-in-hand micro-choice at the end crystallizes a believable shift from remorse to lived forgiveness. The interior contradiction—pride vs. need to apologize—stays active in-scene, not summarized. Lena’s off-page presence still exerts pressure because her imagined forgiveness is dramatized through the condensation vision. The only minor drag is a touch of therapeutic label-speak (“decade of grief”) that briefly flattens the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Anahera’s contradictory impulses—war-honed vigilance versus tender, almost child-like openness—are dramatized in the micro-gesture of whispering to a sleeping boy while re-parenting her own past self. Every tactile choice (thumb on coral, breath catching, placing the fossil beside the cast) externalizes an internal hierarchy of values: translate pain first, self-second. The final renunciation—silence turned into spoken reassurance—carries a felt cost: she forfeits the protective numbness she carried since the refugee tent. Interiority stays embodied; no diagnostic labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the ache for lost joy is palpable in every micro-choice (calibrating the lens “with reverent hands,” pressing the fragment into the crease). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—she never hesitates or risks failure—so the final integration feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. Still, the visible cost (tears, the fragment left behind) locks the change to her body, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority crackles with embodied contradiction—her fingers “knew the language of cracked plaster” while her scholarly ego craves certainty. The nickel-triggered triplex awakening is motivated by each prior micro-choice (excavating the crack, angling the coin, surrendering to silence). The final renunciation—legacy exchanged for curiosity—carries visible cost in the cooled nickel returned to its niche, foreclosing her old professional script. Only a hairline slip into diagnostic self-talk (“she consciously chose”) keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aris’s guarded-spark motive is viscerally anchored in the audit flashback; his micro-choice to bury the seed fuses defiance with scholarly precision. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the buried gourd seed like a heartbeat”). The final stance crystallizes with felt cost—the city-wide gamble—but the beat is single-note; no contradictory impulse complicates his resolve on-page, keeping the arc just shy of top-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The insomnia is dramatized through nightly ritual and centuries of wakeful composition; the postcard trembling in his hand at the climax gives literal, physical cost to his longing. The “shyly unstoppable” trait is shown, not told: he keeps singing off-key lullabies even when no one listens, and that compulsion is what finally awakens the shell. The only soft spot is that the centuries of backstory are delivered in a single expository paragraph rather than through a present-scene trigger that forces a micro-choice; still, the interior contradiction—yearning for sleep yet fearing its erasure—remains vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s devotion is palpable through ritualized micro-choices and embodied tenderness toward the cracked tube, but the interior contradiction never sharpens—no moment where preservation duty collides with private doubt or irreversible cost. The tear is a performed beat rather than a forced concession; we feel caretaker fatigue, not a value hierarchy tested under pressure. Still, her solitary choreography and the fingertip reverence give us a singular, irreplaceable consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet intensity and the 97-day silence backstory give her a sharp wound; her “carefully reckless” trait shows in the bold quill strokes and cross-referencing, but the interior contradiction is stated more than enacted—no moment where recklessness almost derails her. The micro-choice to trace “we” is pivotal and earned, yet Kael remains a reactive mirror rather than a second crucible, so the relationship pressure is implied not staged. The glass ink well acts as an emotional prosthetic—its glow substitutes for embodied reaction, softening the cost of her promise. Still, the endurance of silence and the final tearful delivery feel specific to her; the characterization stays above cliché but stops just short of live fracture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority never rises past generic pastoral awe (“profound weight of connection across time”). Trade-off is stated, not felt; the trembling hands are the only embodied beat, and even that is narrated as symbol rather than lived contradiction. Motivation is externally declared (“sacred tightrope”) and never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything visible. Earned-stasis closure relies on group handshake, not personal renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—protective erasure vs. archival truth—are dramatized in the meteorite-ledger gesture; the final micro-choice to write the testimonial line costs him his fabricated safety and is causally prepared by the dust-vortex memory trigger. Interiority stays concrete (“grief, sharp as the meteorite’s edge”) and avoids label-speak. Only the off-page Lyra and Clara remain abstracts, capping relationship crucible points.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s featherly resolve is embodied through tactile micro-choices (tracing grain, closing logbook), but the interior contradiction promised by “lost child” never surfaces in scene; the epiphany is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and particular; the burnt feather as tactile memory and tool embodies contradiction between loss and guidance. Motivation stays legible and intensifies toward the dawn release. Micro-choice of releasing the feather crystallizes earned renunciation. Could edge higher if one more intermediate choice had risked tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s curiosity and “cheerful gloom” remain embodied through tactile tests with the crater glass; each seed-planting micro-choice reveals her hierarchy of values and compounds her interior contradiction. The final whispered conjecture is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible emotional cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; interiority is concrete and avoids diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corbin’s quiet-rebel motive, tactile ritual with the bishop, and the final nod show embodied, consistent interiority; the single decisive act of gifting the piece costs him his “instrument” and forecloses future gambits, earning a renunciation with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page—only steady execution—so the arc leans toward illustration rather than wrenching tension, capping the 9-band. The elderly man’s instant, tearful recognition is accepted as situational pressure, not unexplained knowledge. Characterization is individuated through synesthetic sea-charting and cello voice, avoiding stock types.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to protect ocean memory while binding herself to land—grounds every micro-choice; the final release of her “spontaneous anchor” crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Kael’s understated trust and bodily awe render him more than vessel, though his lack of prior stakes keeps the dyad just shy of crucible intensity. The moonstone’s vanishing literalizes the price on the page, satisfying the 9+ test, yet the beat remains singular; no secondary flaw touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “gentle rebellion” motive drives every beat. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene, so the arc is lyrical rather than dramatic, but the final covenant feels earned. Micro-choices (stone toss, kneeling, turning toward harbor) are present and character-specific. Missing visible flaw or cost keeps it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.4)
    Interiority is lived-in and embodied: the scars tighten in cold, the porcelain is “cradled with reverence,” the box becomes a compass-not-anchor. Contradictory impulses (protect fragility vs. share pain) coil through every micro-choice until the final stance crystallizes. No stock phrases; even the metaphor of “hard softness” is earned through tactile granite vs. moonlight. Closure cost is unmistakable: he forecloses the option to keep innocence locked away and accepts the public vocation of “keeper of embers.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “lucidly watchful state” is embodied, not labeled—but she never faces a hard choice or contradiction; the timeline rescue is frictionless. No micro-choice costs her anything, so the arc is observational rather than crucible. The gauge chime is the closest thing to cost, and it’s decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is rendered through tactile, embodied action—kneeling, brushing ash, trembling as she lifts the negative—so her interiority stays concrete. The contradictory pull between despair (burned diaries) and hope (hidden film) is dramatized in-scene, not summarized, giving her final covenant felt cost. The only drag is a touch of lyrical self-diagnosis—“legacy’s burden now a companion”—that momentarily lifts us into abstract label-speak instead of letting the weight stay physical.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mirage painter’s calm is vividly embodied and repeatedly tested (heartbeat faltering while voice stays steady), but his interior contradiction—terror of expiry vs. serene mask—never quite alters tactics mid-beat; the borrowed heartbeat is thematic rather than a decision engine. Micro-choices (mirror order, song selection) feel pre-set rather than improvised under new pressure; the “quiet urgency” is declared not discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—gentle ritualist vs. burning commander—simultaneously press every beat; the public confession is an embodied micro-choice that costs his post and forecloses return, paying the redemption price on the page. Interiority is concrete (“clipboard felt…cooled obsidian”) and never drifts into label-speak. The elder’s fist unclenching shows relationship crucible altering state under his gentle pressure. Only lack of secondary-character interiority keeps it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—public savior, private destroyer—are dramatized in the single gesture of placing the egg; the tremor in his hand and the un-wiped tear embody the cost. The interiority stays concrete, never abstract, and the final refusal to look back crystallizes earned stasis. Yet the beat is one-note: no secondary pressure tests him, so the arc is slender for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—frost on temples, swaying torso—while her chastity reads as disciplined resistance, not absence. The contradictory pull between lullaby surrender and thread-untangling agency is dramatized in gesture, not label. Micro-choices (which strand, which knot) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible sweat-cost. The only minor drag: “her chastity was not denial, but dedication” nudges toward abstraction mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—calligrapher hands, puppet guilt, the stick’s warmth—yet the “uncommonly serene” label is asserted more than dramatized after the first paragraph; still, the renunciation of control is credible because it grows from the stick’s remembered purpose and costs him his prior identity as auteur.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet vow and tactile ritualism are vivid; the moment she splints the monarch with the moth wing crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only gap is a near-static internal stance until the butterfly appears; earlier micro-choices tweak method, not motive. Still, the final renunciation of permanence is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt for the village silence vs. the need to preserve names—co-exist in every micro-choice (loosening the braid “with infinitesimal care” while weaving regret). The final renunciation of sorrow is earned because the causality chain (forgiveness → re-weaving → auroral release) makes the cost legible on the page. “Technically gentle” is not a label; it manifests as tactile reverence that risks snapping the brittle card and rope. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—foresight/hindsight versus the haze of now—drives every beat; the moment she fractures the seal is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values and pays the cost of permanent perceptual shift. Embodied emotion (“cold rain was a baptism”) stays particular, never diagnostic. The arc earns its serene renunciation because the prior causal chain (decay forcing transcendence) makes endurance the only credible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    Enlil’s monastic frugality and twenty-year patience are vivid, but interiority slips into abstractions (“covenant with the unknown”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels unearned because no prior flaw or doubt is dramatized on-page. Micro-choices are limited to lamp-oil drips and tile rotation—precise, yet never complicated by error, fatigue, or temptation, so the cost is intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifist strategist identity is vivid in the patient staging of the music box and her refusal to argue; Kael’s bodily memory arc is embodied through trembling palms and tear rather than label. Interior contradiction stays alive because he both craves and fears the release. The final renunciation is earned: the pin’s reappearance costs him the last shield for his resentment. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear when he places the pin beside, not into, the fracture—acceptance without repair.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s calm competence is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (coaxing glass, aligning breath) reveals her vocation and urgency. The interior contradiction between tactile certainty and intangible quest is present, yet the “runaway dream” remains a touch abstract, blunting the final cost’s sharpness. Still, the earned grace of the ending feels personal, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Curator Elara’s interior contradiction—sworn duty vs. hunger for forbidden knowledge—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hand, the whispered question, the silent intent are all embodied and specific. The final beat of “luminous understanding” is earned because her earlier failure at the viewport forces the tactical shift to receptive silence. Cost is legible: guild law breached, tears freeze on her cheeks, stewardship burden newly internalized. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV depth is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s fear-spoken truth catalyzing the vine is a clean micro-choice with embodied cost; the “I am afraid my knowledge is not enough” line crystallizes interior contradiction under pressure. Motivation stays anchored to the diary gaps, driving every beat. Only the Warden’s sudden compliance feels fractionally convenient, muting flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lyra’s grief is embodied in tactile rituals (mannequin, wildflowers) and the hollow is made physical; the renunciation of the card lands as earned because her earlier clinging has bled her. Interiority sometimes drifts toward abstract therapy-speak (“fundamental fracture in her own being”) which blunts the contradiction on the page. Still, the final keeper/gardener self-redefinition visibly costs her the card and the chase, so the arc pays.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s “translate confusion into clarity” drive is concrete, embodied in the rope-work; her calm methodical stance stays coherent while she performs the only action that matters. No contradictory impulses surface in scene, so the internal-conflict bullet is empty, yet the micro-choice hierarchy (weaving the seal at the exact absent year) is legible and costly in felt time. The −0.2 keeps her out of the 9-band because the story never risks her composure—no visible mistake or emotional slippage under pressure, so the arc is smooth but not complexly human.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s shift from dutiful archivist to desperate listener is embodied in the micro-choice to invert the stone’s use—from projection to receptivity—at the exact pressure-point of world-destroying noise. The interior contradiction between archival distance and visceral need is shown through bodily detail (“frantic heat…deep within the marrow”). Closure cost is legible: his identity is rewritten into “keeper of repose hammered true,” a lived stance rather than a label. Minor slip: the tear-release is a touch generic, trimming the otherwise flawless embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her retrocognitive flashes are embodied in “hurried footsteps” and “whispered calculations,” not labels. The shard pressed to her forehead forces a micro-choice that crystallizes her value hierarchy (prove meaning vs. surrender to skepticism). Cost is legible: thirty years of charcoal tracks on hide and the momentary erasure of every comforting hum. The closing smile is earned; no safety-hedging, but the arc stops just short of showing how this victory complicates her life going forward, keeping it from exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archival duty vs. anticipatory grief—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (ink-stained fingers, calibrated breath, the dip of the quill). Her “preemptively nostalgic” trait is not label but engine: it forces her to write while the storm still rages, turning passive observation into agency. The final renunciation—ceding solitude to the collective chorus—carries a visible cost in tear-tracked cheeks and capped ink, earned by the prior causal chain of conjecture → inscription → fissure response. She is individuated through sensory priorities and archival diction; no stock archivist tropes intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her chant anchoring perception, her palm cradling the rag knot—but the “gravity of hopelessness” is declared, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she glides from arrival to revelation without micro-choice that costs her anything. The ending stance is legible, yet the emotional price is only asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured through tide-pool attention and the jade cicada’s recurrence; her refusal to press Kael into speech, instead waiting for his shell-change, is embodied and cost-bearing. The micro-choice to pivot from confrontation to star-lit pool observation dramatizes her “warmly observant” trait under pressure. Kael’s single tear and whispered admission likewise emerge from credible silence rather than authorial nudge. For 600 words, the pair’s stance crystallization carries sufficient felt cost to satisfy the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Contradictory impulses—craving open sky while clutching a bunker relic—are dramatized in the weightless release of the doll. Micro-choice to nest the doll in the new sprout shows value hierarchy shift; cost is the surrender of talismanic fear. Interior voice stays concrete, filtering silence through palate and skin. Slight over-articulation of “claustrophobia dissolved like mist” nudges down from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation as “teacher of silence” is fully embodied—every micro-gesture (lifting the vial, calibrating her murmur) externalizes her intent. Leo’s grief is rendered through bodily tension that visibly softens; neither character slips into therapeutic exposition. The final beat earns its hush: Leo’s “quiet feels like her now” crystallizes a cost (his lifelong memory now re-coded), satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned change. Cap at 8.7 only because Leo’s interior paradoxes remain secondary; his shift is credible but not yet knotted with contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—ruby flake pulsing, sweat at temples—and her renunciation at the end (“turned from the staircase”) is earned by the successive paint-peel choices that show her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she never wavers between ascent and restoration, so the beat feels inevitable rather than wrestled-with. Still, the cost is visible—dissolving shard, foregone crown—so the arc satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her empathy is shown through concrete shadow-handling, not labels. The renunciation at the door is embodied (palm to scar, breath transfer) and carries cost: she re-opens a wound she once sealed. The “burn bridges carefully” trait is dramatized in the memory-groove and the refusal to open the door afterward. Flaw: the beat where she “pours rhythm” across the scar risks summary; a micro-choice inside the link would sharpen contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and “alchemy” motive are vivid; the bolt-as-key micro-choice crystallizes her turn. Interiority stays concrete (“honest edges” vs “smooth lies”). No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible not tested; her virtuously mischievous trait is shown once then shelved. Closure choice is earned, but emotional contradiction could be sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “eloquent silence” is dramatized through tactile attention to dust, brass, vellum—but the moment of crossing the bridge is slightly under-cooked: the tear is the only embodied cost shown. A single micro-choice (aligning the crank) carries the entire turn, so the emotional price feels elegant yet thin. Still, contradiction is present (duty vs. self-forgiveness) and the final stance is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “withdrawn knight” is enacted through guarded motion and armor-scar silence; interior contradiction surfaces when nostalgia for the vow collides with present solitude. The final release of the puppet visibly externalizes his shift from isolation to threshold-guardian, paying the cost of surrendered fixed fate. Flaws—emotional summary in “shivering bliss” and one stock phrase—keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trained eye” and deliberate care root motivation in concrete action. The button discovery triggers a micro-choice (reverent re-fold) that alters her stance, showing earned change. Yet the emotional arc flirts with tidy catharsis; “quiet mending begin within her” states the shift rather than embodying its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her quiet vow, the steady hand on the projector, the final unbroken stance—each micro-choice embodies the archivist-flaw that both enables and endangers her. The moment she decides not to flee crystallizes a hierarchy of values with unmistakable cost: capture traded for continent-wide transmission. No stock labels; her fear is breathed in “wet earth and resolve,” not named. The only bar to 9+ is the absence of an on-page contradictory impulse in the final beat; she is monolithic rather than split.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—mercy against a coded prophecy—remains steady and personal; the grandfather echo supplies credible back-story without over-loading. Interiority is concrete (“breath steady, lips finding the mouthpiece”) and the final renunciation costs him tears and residual silence, so the arc earns its change. Yet we get no contradictory impulse in-scene; he proceeds with near-perfect calm, so the internal conflict feels monovalent, not simultaneous. Still, within 700 words the portrayal is lean, embodied, and sufficient for publishable tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lush, tactile, and consistent—seed-sorting fingers, “mossy delight,” grandmother’s laughter by the hearth. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. sacred search) coexist in-scene, not in summary. Final endurance/renunciation—accepting custodianship without external reward—carries visible cost as the moonstone dissolves; causality intact. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion carries every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is sensorially rich (“hands stained with oil and patience”) and her micro-choice to surrender force at the climax is earned. Missing: a second on-page character to pressure status/relationship dynamics; flaw (control) stated but not allowed to compound into visible mistake before cavern. Still, the river-stone keepsake gives her a tactile, idiosyncratic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is lucid and body-anchored; her micro-choices (arranging shards, uncorking starlight) externalize the need to redeem Kael. Internal contradiction is present—pride vs. humility—but rendered in summary bursts rather than simultaneous scene beats. The final stance shift is earned, yet the absence of on-page Kael limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s vocation, artifact, and motive are cleanly fused; the micro-choice to pluck with the crocodile tooth is embodied and alters theghost’s stance. Interiority stays concrete (“bittersweet weight of release” pressed to her heart). No contradiction under pressure; the modest fearlessness shows as calm attention, not bravado. Cost is felt in the closing silence—path foreclosed, next echo already calling.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“muscles coiling,” “breath hitched”—but the self-diagnosed “trauma-response” label intrudes with textbook distance in the very beats meant to show collapse. Contradictory impulses (flinch vs. deliberate recall) co-exist in scene, and the final smile is credibly earned by the causal chain of micro-memories. Still, the daughter laugh beat arrives as a single image without prior seed, so the cost feels slightly imported, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—reverence vs. the ache of erasure—stays embodied in tactile memory (rope hemp, pipe tobacco). The final act of lodging the shard is a credible renunciation that costs her sole talisman, earned by the triptych of sensory anchors. One micro-choice per painting keeps pressure alive. No status crucible with Cora, but the solitary POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s quiet competence and ghost-seeing gift are embodied through tactile ladder placement, dust-reading, and silent stillness with Elias; the moment he pockets the photograph, his vocation fuses with private vow, earning a cost that seals the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority stays concrete—starlight-stained hands, breath on obsidian—never drifts into label-speak. Contradictory impulse (preserve stasis vs. catalyze entropy) is dramatized in the frost-reading micro-choice, not summarized. Endurance of the rupture leaves her smiling yet alone, a visible cost that forecloses return to static librarian role. Voice remains singular; no secondary character pressures her, so status/relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-propelled devotion is palpable; her embodied micro-choices (covering mirrors, adjusting velvet) dramatize Kaelen’s ideals under pressure. The interior contradiction—academic duty vs. sacred love—drives every beat. Only the late arrival of Valerius keeps relationship-as-crucible from full ignition, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s vocation-linked fragility and the “covenant of rust” philosophy give him a sharp, memorable interiority; the wilting mechanic is embodied (tears, slackened posture) and directly alters his tactics under the chamber’s assault. The final endurance—hand still turning while collapsing—crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; single-POV interiority stays consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “sensibly eccentric” persona is shown through disciplined ritual (aligning the compass, refusing the vial) that costs her the very trophy her trade values; the internal pivot from hunter to witness is embodied, not declared. Psychometry beat gives concrete micro-choice pressing the cracked glass that floods her senses and tilts her stance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—only after the vision does she renounce sampling—so the final renunciation feels 90 % earned rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for ancestral guidance while distrusting tech—is dramatized in her first micro-choice: pocketing the dead GPS instead of discarding it. Her hands “mapped by tides and tools” embody lived craft; every shaving she releases is a simultaneous concession to wood and grand-mother, showing hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—returning the slide yet walking certain—carries visible cost: she forecloses the safety of digital navigation forever. Only minus: “tears warmed…connection” drifts toward label-speak; still, emotion stays embodied in carving motion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is painterly and specific; the grandmother ache is a believable spur. Yet the arc is almost entirely receptive—seeing the glass, feeling moved—without a moment where Elara’s agency alters the world or her art in a way that costs her something visible. The final brush-strokes are reported, not dramatized, so the “earned” change feels lightly sketched. A single micro-choice on the canvas, shown in real time with stakes, would have pushed this into the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s ink-stained hands, sleepless nights, and trembling will to rearrange basalt stones embody an archivist’s obsession; the retrocognitive trap forces a costly silent choice that forecloses passive observation. Interiority stays concrete—heart thrumming, weathered face streaked with tears—never slipping into label-speak. The contradiction between scholarly distance and bodily immersion is held in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation: he forfeits neutral archiving to intervene, paying with the agonising vision itself. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets correctly ignored; single-POV voice remains coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her rejection of nostalgia is shown via the bottle’s warmth, not told. Motive (revive the Cove through craft) is stable, but the moment of conception lacks visible contradiction or cost; it feels too smooth. A micro-flaw rather than a full earned rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s shift from archivist to cultivator is embodied in the silent apple drop and the new blossom; her lifelong obsession with emotional patterns collides with the orchard’s prophecy, forcing a costly abandonment of familiar purpose. Interiority stays concrete—ink-stained fingers, warming wax—yet the epiphany is slightly foreshadow-heavy, not fully dramatized in present beat. Still, the renunciation carries visible price: the archive ends, the garden claims her future.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive to “feel borrowed time” is explicit and governs every beat; her minute seed placements and the final tear embody embodied, contradictory emotion. The interiority is lyrically filtered yet stays particular to a seed-saver’s gaze. Only minor shortfall: no interior flaw or misbelief complicates her flawless execution, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—lifelong duty versus empirical doubt—plays out in concrete micro-choices: checking gauges, tasting air, hovering hand over rope. The final refusal carries visible communal cost (panicked memory of last false alarm) and personal cost (release of “decades of expectation”), satisfying Earned Stasis. Only minor shortfall: the hinge from doubt to final resolve could use one more embodied beat of hesitation to earn full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrically sustained, but the janitor’s only micro-choice—tracing a meteor with a fingertip—never risks tangible cost; the tear is performed, not embodied under pressure. Trait labels (“spiritually curious”) are repeated instead of revealed through contradictory action. No relational crucible or status shift is possible in solo POV, yet even internal contradiction stays static. The arc lands in Earned Stasis, but the cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The recluse’s quiet endurance is credibly embodied, but the interior contradiction between “astonished” and “habitually tranquil” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final acceptance lands as gentle stasis yet feels lightly earned because the earlier beatwork is almost entirely observational.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation is legible and tied to the texture-of-time premise, but the interiority leans on abstraction (“deep calm,” “grateful smile”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path—the rediscovery and final act feel pre-ordained. As a result, the earned-cost bar for 8+ is not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “quiet fire” motivation is stated repeatedly but never tested against an opposing impulse; she simply observes, records, and leaves. No internal contradiction or micro-choice under pressure surfaces, so the arc is static. The feather-quill moment is elegant yet effortless—no visible cost or risk—so the change feels decorative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s quietly fierce stewardship is embodied in every loop of copper; the gnarled fingers, salt-soft diary, and whispered intent make his interior life concrete. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene—only steady resolve—so the “brazen calm” reads as performed virtue rather than tested character. The final placement of the diary in the pillar hollow shows cost, but because the orchard never resists or complicates his plan, the arc feels foreordained, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s luminous skepticism is embodied in every beat: she touches the amber, turns from the gate, chooses the furtive path. The contradiction between her contempt for “curated theater” and her yearning for chemical proof is kept alive in scene, not abstracted. Her final silence with Elias is a credible renunciation of old antagonisms, cost paid in the tear she finally sheds. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s vow is stated early and his micro-choices (scattering pods, pouring water) flow from it, but interiority lapses into abstract paraphrase (“he had not come to erase…”) rather than embodied contradiction; no second impulse presses against the garden vow, so the arc is linear, not crucible. The smile at the end feels unearned because the text never lets him question or risk anything tangible—no lost time, no bodily cost, no trade-off visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his tracing of the waxed leaf, the memory of Elara’s scent, the ache in his ribs as he packs—yet the “intuitively descriptive” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we are told he reads rust patterns rather than shown a beat where that skill alters a choice. The vow-of-retirement stone is a strong motive, but the pivot to chasing the living is powered almost entirely by the cylinder letter rather than an active internal contradiction on the page. Still, the final step onto the cracked earth is a credible renunciation with felt cost, lifting the score into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s immunity-driven solitude and generational sketching vocation give her a sharp, story-specific interiority; the moment she re-weights the ritual from grief to expedition, we feel the cost of continued exile. The contradictory pull between isolation and inherited curiosity is kept alive in every charcoal stroke. Micro-choices (touching the compass, logging the Lyre’s coordinates) consistently externalize her hierarchy of values. Only the final smile feels slightly performative—an unearned emotional label in an otherwise embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s thief-code, mentor reverence, and playful awe are dramatized through micro-choices—hefting the shattered sundial, swapping isolation-pieces for patient-growth pawns—so motives stay embodied. The closing renunciation (“he had not stolen; he had restored”) is earned by the causal chain of piece-by-piece swaps that visibly cost him physical exhaustion and spiritual risk. Interior contradiction flickers only once: “spirit alight” vs. “tears froze,” yet the beat lands as awe, not lapse. Sufficient for 9+, but the single-POV isolation means no relational crucible to test the code under another will.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—performance vs. preservation—animates every step; the benevolently ruthless trait is dramatized when she “gently but firmly” extracts others’ pain without pause. Embodied emotion is steady (“her boots silent on cracked stone”) and the final renunciation—placing the pawnless board—pays the cost of never again using trauma as mere material. The nomadic penumbra remain shadows, not crucible, so relationship pressure is thin; still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible. Closure earns stasis with felt price: she forfeits personal comfort to carry witness forward.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lush—her rejection of illusion for the feather’s texture is a vivid micro-choice that crystallizes values. The decade of numbness is rendered as bodily weight, not therapy-speak. Only the mother’s hands/clay memory feels briefly generic; a hair more specificity would push this into 9-band. Closure cost is felt: mercury glass abandoned, path taken, no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s guilt is viscerally embodied—tears that can’t fall, silver thread braided into chess knots—and his micro-choices (thread-sorting as pawn-structure analysis) externalize contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of exile is earned because the decoded tapestry literally reenacts the defensive lesson he failed to teach, so absolution carries a felt, on-page cost. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. Only cap: no second character, so relationship crucible bullet not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mischief against communal grief—drives every beat: ink-stained fingers clutching verse while elders preach, her micro-choice to speak at the spire forecloses silence and costs her exile-risk. Embodied emotion (“tears cutting paths through dust”) anchors moral stakes in bodies. Final renunciation of singularity is earned by prior refracting acts and carries visible social cost when Borin amends the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—terror of dissolution vs. need to transmute grief—drives every micro-choice; the ritual stitches memory to fracture with visible cost. The final “warm sparrow” in his palm is earned renunciation: workshop lost, meaning salvaged. No stock labels; embodiment is precise (“tears cutting paths through grime”). Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior ache is vivid and embodied; the mirrored fracture physically echoes inside him. His choice to release, not keep, the shell is earned through the cave’s charged stillness. The “intimately aloof” stance is shown, not labeled, in the final beat. Minor: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is absent by design.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial-cork ritual crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Silas’s single-scene reversal from bluster to tearful awe is credible because the scent-triggered vision is staged as an involuntary sensory blow, not persuasion. The micro-choice to ease the cork rather than blast the horn visibly forecloses Elias’s prior silence and re-configures their professional dynamic. Cost is felt: Elias’s trembling fingers and Silas’s stripped voice show the moment’s emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices (soldering, pocketing the censer foot) that externalize contradictory impulses—cling vs. release—until the final wire joins memory to present. The “reverse migration” motive stays legible and intensifies; the earned renunciation (she keeps the broken station) carries visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak; scarred fingers, rosin scent, and moonlit quartz give us a body thinking. Only the phone voice remains off-page, so status dynamics can’t complicate further; still, the single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive is crystal-clear and her involuntary truthfulness is dramatized at the checkpoint, not just asserted. The internal contradiction—she must succeed yet cannot lie—drives every micro-choice from footfall to truffle wrap. The sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t apply, but the antique eye as love-token reweights the final image. No stock therapy-speak; dread and hope are embodied in rain-slick stone and moss-lined silk.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—his need to decode vs. his creed of non-interference—drives every beat; the micro-choice to press the flower into the log crystallizes his arc with visible cost (loss of pristine solitude). Embodied emotion is precise: “tears welled, not of sorrow, but kinship.” No head-count issues; borrowed-memory backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters stance. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and forecloses investigative chase.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s empirically intuitive trait is shown, not told, and his shift from skepticism to belief is embodied in the ant-tracking choice; the final renunciation of loneliness carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat of “tears blurred his vision” drifts toward label. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy (mentor vow > personal safety) is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyra’s interiority is concrete—her “quiet erosion” and the climb as shedding duty—and the final renunciation of disenchantment is earned by the grotto vision. The silver fox functions as pressure, not just symbol, forcing the micro-choice of shared breath. Only flaw: the queen’s “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than embodied until the final line, slightly underpaying the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“scientifically romantic” is shown through pigment science and cosmic awe—but her contradictory impulses stay implicit; no micro-choice visibly risks failure, so the final renunciation feels lightly earned. The shift from observer to co-creator is declared, not dramatized with a felt cost. Kael and Lyra function as emotional catalysts rather than pressure sources; their arcs are sketched, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is textured (“hot, corrosive jealousy”) and drives the dream confrontation; the jealousy → wonder shift is embodied in the wave from the younger self. The grave-shock incites the scroll act, but the causal bridge between cemetery jolt and cabin compulsion is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping motivation just short of airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—healer who cannot heal herself—drives every tactile micro-choice; the clamp-repair beat crystallizes her new alchemy with embodied cost. Relationship pressure with Mrs. Gable reshapes both women’s states in a single scene. No stock phrasing; every emotion is flesh-and-metal. Closure choice is earned: renunciation of scented past, acceptance of occluded sight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor that crystallizes the ink externalizes her fear without label-speak. The single tear is a micro-choice that credibly flips the magic, making the scar-rewrite feel earned. Motivation stays anchored to the childhood fall and grandmother superstition, giving the final luminous palm a visible cost. The only minor slip: “stories of resilience, not ruin” edges toward thematic statement rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven apology is embodied through tactile micro-choices (ice-bottle, steady voice, hovering fingers) and a credible renunciation of her exploitative past; the internal contradiction between sensationalist instinct and atonement is dramatized in real time. The final forgiveness is earned by the causality of scent-triggered memory and her unvarnished “careless axe” admission at the piano, closing the path back to her old byline with visible spectral tears as cost. No therapy-speak; metaphors serve her exorcist method, not self-diagnosis. A hairline slip: “threadbare trench-coat pocket” is familiar shorthand, not fully character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is consistently textured—"the weight of solitude, the love for what was lost"—and her micro-choice to speak "I am" crystallizes her arc. The final smile is earned, but earlier beats lean on abstract motive ("quiet necessity") rather than embodied contradiction, so the arc feels more luminous than lacerating.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shepherd’s quiet obsession is dramatized through tactile ritual (key, droplet, countdown) that externalizes interior stakes; the final smile embodies earned renunciation with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene—only steady revelation—so the beat falls just short of maximal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-versus-permeability motive is coherent and embodied in the laser test, but her “spatial gift” remains a label; it never constrains or enables a single on-page action, so the interior contradiction feels announced rather than dramatized. Kael functions as gentle chorus, not pressure source, so the relationship alters nothing at stake; the final tear is earned, yet the cost is purely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her father’s mica metaphor, the “clover melancholy”—but the emotional arc is reported more than dramatized; the pivotal subway-door beat relies on lantern-light magic rather than a choice that costs her anything. The “theoretically rebellious” tag is asserted, never tested by an on-page gamble or equation. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the filial wound feels specific.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-sharpened vocation is rendered through concrete ritual (the booth, the disc, the nightly hum) and a single, credible micro-choice: she hums a release scale that turns the caller’s loop into a path. The interior contradiction—self-exile that hungers to re-connect—is alive in every beat, no therapeutic self-labeling. Cost is felt: her own “fortress” becomes “harbor,” a re-configuration she must keep paying rent on. Voice stays individual: her metaphors are sonic, tunnel-deep, never borrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied; the silver locket warmed by “skin and sorrow” shows emotion through object rather than label. Her contradictory impulses—clinging vs. releasing—coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. The micro-choice to press the locket into the damp paper crystallizes values and cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s loneliness and jocular-mask are sharply embodied; the shift from crisis-jetsetter to stillness is credible. Only the decisive renunciation of the “cure” motive is slightly rushed—one more micro-choice would lock the cost. Still, interior contradiction and embodied emotion hold under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—grief is felt through bark, dew, ring-heat—yet the arc is almost frictionless: every step confirms progress, no blind-spot error or temptation to abandon. The mentor’s quoted maxim is the only overt diagnosis, but it’s brief and grounded in touch. A single micro-choice (kneel, palms to earth) crystallizes acceptance, cost felt in cooling ring and softened “sharp edges.” Meets 9- gate: contradiction present, change earned, cost on page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—certainty vs. doubt—are dramatized in the flashback console beat and re-emerge as she coaxes the nib straight; the interior contradiction is embodied, not labeled. The pen’s physical pushback and her bone-felt sigh externalize the cost of softening self-blame, making the shift legible and earned. No secondary characters on page, so relationship bullets skipped; single-POV interiority remains coherent and profession-specific. Final “confidently uncertain” stance is foreshadowed and paid for by the preceding causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory grief-love drives every micro-gesture; the camera he cannot load and the silent duet he performs externalize the conflict in body, not label. His renunciation of film to honor Anya and his acceptance of Lily’s sign-duet are linked by the same motive-to-silence, paying visible emotional cost. Interiority is sensory, salt-air and chill brass, never abstract. Relationship shift with Lily crystallizes the “advisor” status: he is heard again, yet the cost of solitude remains—Earned Stasis achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—analytical arsonist turned tender archivist—are dramatized through the tactile handling of each artifact; the final copy-action shows a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the sister-memory is slightly over-articulated (“Even scars can sing”) and flirts with diagnostic speak, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s longing to resurrect the communal dream is viscerally embodied in every drum-strike; the quiet rebellion is shown, not labeled. Interior contradiction—hope against knowledge of impermanence—drives the climax as he wills the ephemeral forms to stay. The final renunciation (“he would return tomorrow”) costs him continued pain, earned by the prior sensory expenditure. Only minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-vision.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—rescue Vale yet prove quiet mastery—drives every micro-choice; the coin/key tactile rituals embody cost. Walk-identification trait enables the locating beat and later humbles Vale, so competence is earned, not gifted. Final refold of the map shows renunciation of louder validation; the cost is Vale’s prior contempt now mirrored in his silence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s silence-as-empathy is dramatized through micro-gesture (mirror angling, shutter choreography) rather than label; Elara’s shift from paralysis to released sob is embodied, not explained. Interior contradiction is missing—Kael never doubts, Elara never resists—which flattens the crucible. Still, the final Earned Stasis (shared gaze, pocketed mirror) carries visible cost: the secret stays unspoken yet is metabolized.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction is thin—his telepathy is stated, never tested or doubted. Leo’s arc is visible but externally driven; the final hand-hold is sweet yet feels gifted rather than wrested. No micro-choice by Elias visibly risks or costs him anything; the “silent vow” is opaque. Interiority is lyrical but generic—any thoughtful mentor could own these cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “quiet rebellion” and “combative tenderness” are evocative abstractions rather than embodied contradic- tions; we are told her grace is resistance but never shown a beat where it costs her or alters power on the dock. The scrimshaw-as-vow is powerful, yet its warming pulse and final dissolution feel like external fiat rather than earned culmination of micro-choices. Interiority drifts into summary (“spirit starved,” “walls of salt and regret”) that blurs the moment-to-moment stakes; no single dock or underwater beat lets us watch her choose gentleness when force would be easier. Result: a compelling silhouette but not yet a lived-in psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—knife, blood, bird sculpture externalize grief without label-speak. The contradiction between performed cheer and interior collapse stays active in-scene. Cost is visible: the sparrow placed in dead flowers crystallizes renunciation of the old mask. Missing second character keeps relationship crucible off-page, capping score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The poet’s drive is declared (“aesthetically driven in every breath”) rather than dramatized through micro-choices that cost him anything. The final kneel and hand-to-ice beat is the only embodied action that fuses motive to body; earlier beats are observational. Earned stasis is present, but the lack of visible trade-off keeps it below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” trait drive every micro-choice—plant placement, reed gift, tactile reading of glass—so motivation stays embodied. Kael’s shift from shame to grateful breath is credible because the reed and bubbled sphere literalize his inherited wound. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; “golden texture” is felt, not labeled. Cost is visible: Kael’s shame exposed, Elara’s sonic “palette” forever altered.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment versus ritual devotion—are dramatized in the moment she flat-lines the sensors yet chooses to keep listening; her embodied tears at the grandmother-music-box reprise make the cost of vulnerability immediate and irreversible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile micro-choices—folding cranes, placing lockets—each action tightening the jeweler’s identity and loss. The contradictory impulse to abandon craft yet keep creating under Lena’s mandate gives credible internal pressure. Final renunciation of despair costs her the safety of numbness, earned by sustained imagery of seed-pendants and coordinate bracelets. Only slight over-articulation: “genuinely artificial” label repeated without new inflection mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “steadily curious” vocation is shown through tactile micro-choices—smoothing parchment, unspooling tape—that externalize motive without label-speak. Leo’s collapse and recognition are credibly embodied; his tear-stained epiphany grows from the mirrored map rather than therapy-speak. Interior contradictions (urge to map vs. need to comfort) stay implicit; the inherited-flaw engine is present but soft because Leo’s pressure is borrowed, not self-compounded. Closure cost is felt—she forfeits solitude and a fragment of the map—yet the moment is slightly under-crystallized because Leo, not Elara, pays the overt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—gloved finger on bronze, uneven breath, deliberate bird-leap thoughts—showing embodied contradiction under pressure. The fracturing of her innocence is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (shattering the meal memory with the dancing elder stumble) rather than abstract labels. Cost is visible: sweat-saffron threads, tear-etched dust, unshackled spirit. Only the “anguished joy” label approaches diagnostic shorthand, but it is immediately anchored in the final image of tear-gleamed cheeks, so the slip stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and body-anchored (“tears traced warm paths,” “sharp eyes seeing”), her micro-choice to surrender the stone is earned by the footage epiphany, and her flaw (clinging to stasis) complicates the arc. Yet the sole on-page relationship is with the absent shadow, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are moot and the cost, while felt, is lightly dramatized; still, the renunciation visibly forecloses her old role.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction pulses on the page—shame vs. open heart, discernment vs. warmth—each micro-choice (boxing the tail, sketching the latch) embodies the tension. Embodied emotion is acute: the “cold stone” breath-steals, shoulders physically unlock. The renunciation at 274-“guardian and healer were two wings” lands only after causal sequence of shedding beats, paying visible cost of fear and self-doubt. Voice never slips into therapy-speak; even abstract realizations stay moored to tactile workshop world.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her “quiet obsession,” the way she maps coffee rings, her tactile focus on bandage and sheet. The flaw (re-opening wounds) is dramatized through the coffee-ring beat and the climactic renunciation of that habit, so change carries cost. No contradictory impulses share a beat; emotion is embodied but not yet rawly conflicted under peak pressure. Fits 8.0; nudge toward 8.5+ would need one more layered contradiction voiced in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her stained fingers, spatial mapping of emotion, and the final “hushed thunder” peace all feel earned. The contradiction between her psychometric gift and her need to physically cradle the film shows an active, costly micro-choice. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is a solitary renunciation that lands with visible cost. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic label-speak (“symphony of sorrow”) but it is quickly buried in sensory detail, so the quick-test for 9+ is almost—but not quite—met.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief-blocked artist interiority is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to trace each meteor re-opens feeling with credible irrationality. The “rest” surrender is earned because every prior beat has forced her to confront her self-built cage. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; all pressure is internal and holds. Flaw: the grandmother’s remembered voice edges toward thematic echo, not full dramatized contradiction, keeping this just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Guard’s dreamless vow and quantum-gardener identity are vivid, but interior contradiction is missing; no moment where duty to archive conflicts with private need. Micro-choice in hollow—kneel, unstrap, hum—is present yet cost is abstract (emptiness as shield). Endurance reads as quiet saintliness rather than flawed, risky commitment. Needed: one beat where archive’s “occasionally everywhere” threatens to overwrite his own mind, forcing a renunciation that scars.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s interiority is lyrical but generic—no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene. The “vow” and “quiet urgency” are asserted, never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything. The gear insertion is calm ritual, not pressured decision; the closing “he was no longer lost” is told, not earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and character-specific; the ‘quiet ache’ motive grounds every beat. Contradictory impulses—cling to safety vs. step into mist—co-exist in scene, not summary. The final Charged Poise (hand over heart, glowing ticket) is earned by the prior star-imprints and meanders; cost is felt. Voice convergence under stress is minor; guides speak alike but their role is choral, not individuated, so the slight flattening is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory guilt / duty currents braid viscerally: her crushed hand flares with every polished floor, grounding cowardice in nerve-fire. The bench-bolt memory crystallizes Kael’s caretaker ethos and her complicity, earning her vow to open the stair-memorial. Interiority stays concrete; no abstract self-diagnosis. Final renunciation (“the bolt on the concierge desk”) bears visible cost and is fully motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s interiority is lyrically compressed yet rooted in embodied ritual (shaving the pellet, quill-work); his renunciation of the crown lands as Earned Stasis because the text links the fading library to the price of his dispersal. Interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in scene, so motivation feels steady-state rather than sharpened under live opposition. The “regally unpretentious” trait is shown through humble tasks, but no micro-choice under pressure tests that humility against a conflicting desire.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s tactile grief and rhythmic memory practice are vivid and embodied; the contradiction between passive monitoring and active remembering is dramatized in her fingertips. The moment she reclassifies tapping as cartography (“not mourning… cartography for the intangible”) crystallizes a visible cost—her prior grief-work was mislabeled. Interiority stays concrete, but one slip into diagnostic summary (“she existed in a state of drifting moored”) slightly blunts the contradiction under peak pressure. Still, the final renunciation of witness-as-mourner to witness-as-mapper is earned and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass lineage give concrete interior texture; the shift from “awkward confidence” to resolve is legible via bodily resonance with the stones. Yet the epiphany is delivered in abstract summary (“understood the lull…as a vital margin”) rather than dramatized contradiction, so the cost feels cerebral, not visceral. Still, the micro-choice to carry the hum outward supplies a credible renunciation of despair.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s insurgent past and plant-telepathy are dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling to read the kite, pressing the amber seam). The final act of unsealing carries visible cost—she knowingly violates elder scrolls yet earns the land’s gratitude, fulfilling “evolve tradition with intent.” Interiority stays concrete: “calloused fingers,” “breath tasting of minerals,” never drifting into label-speak. The only minor slip is perfect emotional calibration in onlookers’ awe.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is concrete—muscles locking at gull-cry, hand steadying on bark—yet the “pearl of stillness” is named more than enacted, so contradictory impulses stay summary. The photograph beat shows hierarchy of values, but no micro-choice alters present risk; endurance costs are felt yet already paid before scene start. Earned, but therapy-adjacent phrasing (“somatic markers,” “integration”) slightly softens peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s shame-knot is embodied in tactile thread-work; the self-compassion payoff is earned because the untangling beats dramatize micro-choices that rewire his artistic identity. Interiority stays concrete (“luminescent ache warming his palms”) and avoids label-speak. The arc from avoidance to descent-and-repair is credible and scaled to length, though the mentor-love beat is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s calm-anger contradiction is embodied in tactile micro-choices (fingers on stone, stilling breath) and drives the final renunciation; the “consciously wild” trait, however, is asserted more than dramatized, and the drone-loss backstory is recounted rather than tested in scene, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. conscience—are dramatized in one micro-choice under lethal pressure; the embodied “weight against her sternum” and split-second thumb-press show motive turned to irreversible action with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s pacifism is embodied in daily micro-choices (barefoot walk, whispering to roses, deliberate sheathing) rather than labels; the father’s knife ritual dramatizes an internal contradiction that forecloses violence with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and sense-rooted (“thumb brushed rough patch,” “cool glass”); no diagnostic self-talk. The only soft spot is that the father’s legacy is referenced more than it is pressure-tested on the page; the conflict is mostly internal and static, so the arc edges toward renunciation rather than transformation under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s calm resolve is embodied through gesture and micro-choice (zigzag footwork, exhaling silence, driving the spike). Contradictory grief for her daughter surfaces only at the climax and is immediately offered, so the interior arc is legible but compressed. No head-count or status issues; single-POV holds. Final “remaking” is earned by prior causal use of silence and spike, satisfying cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is crystal-clear and intensifies beat-by-beat; her contradictory grief/resolve is shown through tactile micro-choices (thumb on nib, deliberate ink stroke). The “proof-by-contradiction” method externalizes an interior logic and is consistently embodied rather than declared. Closure cost is visible in the tear/chuckle as she commits to publishing a painful truth, foreclosing the safe silence her grandfather staged.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, the exact cry she once ignored—so the final self-reckoning lands with felt cost. The trait of translating cries is shown mid-action, not labeled, and directly forces her climactic hum. One minor slip: “profound loneliness” is half-tell; still, the contradictory impulse (urge to silence vs need to answer) plays out in real time, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid—“brittle crack of a surrendered grudge” embodies emotion without labels. Motivation stays anchored to the concrete goal of pattern-finding; every sand grain placed is a micro-choice that externalizes inner need. The final “Integrate” is earned because the mandala’s construction dramatizes the ache it answers. Cost is visible: the mandala dissolves, peace is fleeting, yet she pockets the flake—an acceptance of impermanence baked into gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s quiet radicalism is vividly embodied—her mending of stones, the cobalt shard in her pocket, the deliberate kneel to brush ash. Interior contradiction is alive: the same object that triggers traumatic flashbacks becomes the tool of reclamation. The final release is earned: pressing the tessera into wet mortar literalizes her shift from trapped witness to architect of mercy. Minor slip: “aberrant mercy” is named twice in summary voice; dramatizing the elders’ scorn through a single shouted line would have pushed this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-anchored persistence is vivid; synesthetic interiority gives her a perceptual signature and every echo she gathers is a micro-choice that externalizes longing. Yet the text never lets her doubt or mis-step; she executes the braiding flawlessly, so no interior contradiction compounds. Julian’s late apparition supplies the emotional payoff, but because he arrives as a perfected memory rather than a pressured presence, the relationship crucible never actively tests her. Still, within 800 words the arc from anchored yearning to luminous release feels proportionate and the renunciation cost (letting go her own ghostly form) is legible on the last page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s skepticism and compassion are well-embodied through micro-choices (handing over the geode, surrendering to somatic cues). The shift from doubt to “skepticism tempered by affection” is earned on-page, but the interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic self-labeling (“somatic markers,” “willowglass hope”) that flattens peak beats. Maya remains a necessary witness rather than a fully contradictory crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Still, the final renunciation of proof in favor of solace carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s vocation and solitude are vividly embodied; the palm-to-stone moment lets contradictory impulses (wonder vs duty) coexist in scene. The final choice to entrust the floating fossil to the tide-crack is earned: she relinquishes sole custody, accepting future interpreters. Interiority stays concrete, though “hope bloomed” edges label-speak. Cost is legible: she walks away lighter yet more alone.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s quietly urgent motivation is anchored in tangible ritual; the 40-year button archive and the canyon-echo jar give her interiority weight. The final choice—to carry the mosaic to the square—pays off prior causality with felt cost (foregoing hermitic safety). No contradiction under pressure; her endurance is stoic yet charged. Would need one more micro-choice crack in mid-scene to hit 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory tremor/hope duality is embodied in the pillbox-hand moment; the micro-choice to swap pills for the forget-me-not crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Anya’s return supplies external pressure, forcing a public stance that seals the thaw. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final hand-off is earned by the ciphered apology that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—clinging to a geography-bound vow while sensing its futility—plays out in tactile micro-choices (thumb on needle, soft click to the mare). The endurance he chooses costs the fantasy of returning to Gloom Hill, felt in the final ferry step. Earned, character-particular, no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the wasteland’s nihilism—is dramatized in the tremor of the glass against his palm, not told. The micro-choice to cradle, not wield, the glass embodies his hierarchy of values and foreshadows the Earned Stasis he accepts: carry gentleness back into desolation, cost felt in the final breath-rhythm. No diagnostic self-talk; even “phototropic” is never interiorized as jargon, only enacted. The only cap is the absence of a second character, so status dynamics and relational crucible tests are N/A; solo-portrait is otherwise vivid and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the “wistfully pragmatic” trait is dramatized through the nightly ritual and shoulder-fatigue cost. Contradictory impulses—retreat vs. outreach—coexist in the same beats. The final renunciation (ending the ritual, cradling the thorn) is earned and charged. Only minor slip: Mateo’s interiority is ventriloquised with perfect certainty for one line.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection while guarding her alien knowledge—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the sundial and the decision to write. The moment she chooses testimony over secrecy crystallizes her arc with visible cost: the solitude she accepts is not cured, but weaponized into stewardship. Interiority stays concrete and particular; no therapeutic self-labeling intrudes. The only drag is the absence of a second on-page character to pressure her status, but within single-POV confines the arc is complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her quiet collecting and final placement of “home” crystallize a believable arc from detached observer to participant. The contradiction between hoarding strangers’ secrets and craving her own connection stays implicit yet legible. No head-hopping or label-speak; micro-choices (gathering, weaving, writing) track her hierarchy of values. Voice remains coherent, but the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cranked—her loneliness dissolves almost too smoothly, restraining the score from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. sacrificial guardianship—drives every micro-choice: bypassing the filter, steadying the gain, accepting tears. Hope is embodied, not labeled, and the final smile costs him his job security, a price legible on the last page. No stock phrasing; even “celestial mathematics” is filtered through his technician’s gaze. TheEarned Stasis is fully motivated: he forecloses retreat and accepts retaliation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait collide in every beat: she measures steps, fights panic, and still climbs the loft. The internal contradiction—fear vs responsibility—drives every micro-choice; her refusal to retreat carries the village’s survival as visible cost. The compass-handling and single organ chord are concrete, character-specific actions that externalize her spine. Final tear-tracked acceptance of permanent fear is earned stasis with price.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s synesthetic attention to texture-souls is vivid, but her “methodical” trait is announced rather than dramatized in micro-choices; the interior contradiction between seeking empathy while guarding her own solitude is hinted but not crystallized on the page. The final tears feel inevitable yet the causal cost is more atmospheric than embodied. Still, the specificity of her fingertip reading and the refusal to chase faces create a memorable, non-generic protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingertip tracing the stanza, the cold copper nail in her palm—but the “nervously confident” label is announced, not embodied. The micro-choice to press the nail into the page is concrete and stakes-shifting, showing her ancestor’s exile reversal as lived cost. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure; she moves from dread to certainty without visible internal friction. The final hand that “no longer trembles” is earned, but the emotional arc is tidier than human.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the bridge’s loss versus embracing fragmentation—surface only in abstract summary; the bow-on-strings moment is too brief to dramatize a costly, specific choice. Interiority is vivid (“luminous disbelief”) but drifts toward label-speak. The arc lands as renunciation, yet the cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, his perceptual signature is sharp enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Leo’s “polished calm” and “blood-and-memory” pull are compellingly embodied; the beat where he fans the banknotes onto the seat crystallizes inherited hunger under pressure. Interior contradiction is palpable when he admits the identical territorial hunger in both outlaw and founder. Micro-choice—abandoning the money—carries visible cost and lands as earned renunciation. Only the junior-developer foil feels slightly under-etched, muting the relationship-as-crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s solitude-frayed interiority is palpable; the telegram triggers a visible micro-choice that reorients her stance. The single on-page relationship (Kael, via letter) functions as crucible: his remembered voice dissolves her stubborn isolation and reweights the watch. Cost is felt: she relinquishes lone ownership of the night. Missing only a deeper contradiction in-scene to reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s armor-of-thorns solitude is shown through bodily rigidity and the twenty-year grudge she must literally unbend; the micro-choice to “loosen her shoulders” dramatizes the flaw in scene. The final apology carries cost because the flashback of the frozen cowardice has been anchored and revisited. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, taut physical metaphors (“warlike serenity,” “blade before strike”) keep emotion embodied. Missing only a secondary character to test status, but single-POV pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her wrist birthmark flares, her body “hums,”—but the contradiction between dread and hope is stated more than dramatized; still, the final press of the clipping into the rift is credibly costly and rooted in her scar-map.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s fiercely gentle precision, embodied grief, and micro-choices (orchid on skull, stone in bone-hand) render interior contradiction palpable; the final absorption of sorrow costs him bodily weight and forecloses return. No stock phrasing; every beat sharpens his penance. Earned renunciation lands with visible price: silver scars inside the emptied rib-hole. Voice stays singular, flaw intact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—emotional insulation via facts vs. the shame that breaks the ritual—are dramatized in-scene through trembling fingers, whispered specs, and the final renunciation of auction-house validation. The micro-choice to write the cloth’s story (not its price) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he forfeits prestige and embraces quiet service. Interiority stays concrete and roadie-particular; no diagnostic self-talk. The arc earns its shift because the failure on television is tethered to the earlier Akron memory and the cloth’s re-weighting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s grief-riven obsession is rendered with embodied tremors and ritual micro-motions; the seed beats bridge memory and present pressure. One contradiction—thirty-year seeker who still trembles—remains vivid. Closure renunciation is earned: he abandons control for stewardship, cost visible in tear-streaked dust. Missing only a sharper second pressure beat to force an earlier tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interior life is sonically rich (“her fingers tracing…humming a resonant song”), but her contradictory impulses are announced (“identity peacefully migrating…a contradiction that deepened her resilience”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The waxing-crescent cue is concrete, yet no scene-bound choice is narrowed by it; the smelting ritual succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or risk to her stance. Because the beat is largely observational, the motivational engine feels static rather than escalating toward an earned renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief-forged solitude is credibly embodied in bunker-metallic diction; the pearl-as-witness device gives his renunciation a tactile cost. Interior contradiction flickers (“fancifully…yet believed”) but never fully combusts under pressure; the final shift to guardian is more asserted than dramatized. Still, the specificity of his trained gaze on hairline cracks transfers neatly to the shell’s spiral, making the closure feel personal rather than thematic ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—methodical surveyor vs. raw, un-medicated feeling—stay active in every beat; the taped accordion and the folded-map sacrifice visibly externalize her self-forgiveness arc with cost. Interiority is concrete (“ivy whispered against her sleeves” equals paternal guilt). The final micro-choice to leave the map in the tile crack crystallizes renunciation with felt price. One hairline slip: “tear of release” edges toward label-speak, but embodied motion follows instantly, blunting the cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for silence vs. need to speak—is dramatized in the final apology. The watch-driven micro-choices (timing transcriptions, anticipating word-flickers) tether motive to action. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of permanent silence. Voice remains individual; no stock “dreamer” tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scholarly duty vs. plant-bond—are enacted in every micro-choice (coffee reading, ice-bow stroke) and culminate in a renunciation whose cost is felt in the dissolved violin and her own tears. Interiority stays concrete, biased, plant-tuned; no label-speak. The mulberry’s grief literally presses her hand; the final silence is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s vow and tactile reverence give her a clear, embodied motive that escalates to the decisive placement of the chip; the “beautician-mortician” duality is shown through ritual action rather than label. Interiority stays concrete—cooling skin, auroral light pooling—so emotion is never declared. The final tear of gratitude is earned because the cost (Kael’s death and her solitary vigil) has been dramatized. No contradictory impulse is staged, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on bark, the slow breath that steadies her—but the forgiveness itself is reported, not dramatized, so the final renunciation feels pre-decided rather than forged under fresh pressure. The contradiction between lingering resentment and self-care could have bitten harder in real time. Still, her micro-choices (ascent, placement of the hairpin, chisel tap) all align with the stated motive and carry a visible cost: another sliver of stone gone, another scallop that can’t be undone.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s guilt is palpably embodied in the tremor of his hands and the weight of the cloak; the contradictory impulse to cling to blame yet yearn for release is alive in the beat where he both grips the shard and finally lets it fall. Elara’s “sincerely insincere” tactic is dramatized, not labeled, in her gentle counterfeit agreement that lures him toward nuance. The final unhooking and release of the shard visibly foreclose his old identity with a felt, proportionate cost. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; the only minor drag is one line of therapeutic self-label (“I clutched a lie”) that slightly over-articulates what the gesture already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses—yearning to share vs need to withhold—are alive in every beat; the final renunciation of immediate disclosure is earned by the grotto trance and carries visible cost in the withheld face of his daughter. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“time unwinding in his marrow”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice of stone-casting triggers the climax; memory loss of Elara’s adult face is the charged flaw driving stakes. Only micro-slippage: “reverse-lived years” is briefly abstract amid otherwise embodied motive.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete, tied to embodied stillness: “his spirit yearned to map…not of stone, but of resonance.” Contradictory impulses (brittle body vs. yearning spirit) coexist in-scene and power the climax. Final renunciation—becoming the still anchor—carries visible cost: “he did not rise…his weathered resolve had become the canyon’s new harmonic anchor.” Voice specificity and micro-choices hold; no stock label-speak. Hairline slip: “historically reverent to his marrow” leans toward diagnostic shorthand, but is instantly grounded by the arrowhead beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s slow-hand faith versus industrial spellcraft is viscerally embodied—ink under fingernails, frost on tears—yet her final refusal to “take” the keystone is prefigured only by thematic statement, not an earlier dramatized flaw of possessiveness; the renunciation still lands because the causality of “witness, not harvest” is threaded through every beat of sensory memory she feeds the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored obsession is embodied through tactile ritual (key, logbook) and micro-choices that visibly cost him emotional armor; the renunciation of the key at the end is earned by the preceding dissolve of his fact-shield. Interior contradiction is alive in every beat—he fingers books while reciting tide data to stay afloat—until the archive forces surrender. No diagnostic self-talk; the laughter=honey line is shown as sensory memory, not label. The only bar to 9 is that the turn is single-arc: once the log speaks, resistance collapses almost immediately—no second compound mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, her contradictory impulses (doubt vs. duty) alive in the same beat; the quiet enthusiasm trait is embodied, not labeled, and her final stance costs her the illusion of agency. The coins-as-memory motif is reweighted at closure, making her renunciation legible and painful. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (hand on resin, coin cast) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost. Meets 9+ quick test: choice is earned, cost is felt, contradiction is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The heartbreak→naming imperative is clear and embodied in micro-choices (positioning the prism, channeling grief into each beam). Interiority stays concrete, but the repeated “echo of sacrifice” phrase edges toward label-speak, slightly dulling the final crystallization beat. Still, the renunciation of wordless grief carries visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “lukewarm” magic and brittle devotion are embodied in the micro-choice to count heartbeats between 4.1-second drops; the final tear-streaked smile crystallizes her earned stance. Interiority stays concrete, but the single-POV isolation means relationship/status crucibles never activate, capping depth at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is concrete (“felt the absence of sound like a shift in atmospheric pressure”) and links grandmother memory to present choice. Micro-choice—wrapping bottle instead of cataloging—embodies “precisely humane,” but the emotional turn is slightly underplayed: throat-pang is named, not embodied in gesture or breath. Still, motivations track cleanly to the final promise, meeting the 9- test.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—precision vs sentimentality enacted in thumb-stroking the river stone while clutching the crystal. Embodied emotion arrives (“tears, warm and unbidden”) without label-speak. Final synthesis is earned because the copper-lattice micro-choice replicates the starling epiphany and visibly mends her fracture; cost is the risk of shattering the crystal and, by extension, her identity. Cap 8.7 because the mentor memory remains a static talisman rather than a blind spot that could complicate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—terror of the buckle versus need to revise—drives every beat; the embodied shiver/pen scratch shows simultaneous impulses. Trust-preservation motive tightens through micro-choices (line-through, stance shift) with visible cost (tear, lighter burden). Final stance crystallizes under earned causality; no safety-hedging. Could edge 9+ if memory flash gave one additional present-tactic fumble.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kaela’s contradictory impulses—her craving to feel again versus her acceptance of numbness—are dramatized in the gesture of placing palms on glass and choosing union rather than ownership. Interiority is concrete (“the gesture feeling both foreign and familiar”), emotions are embodied, and the final smile-through-tears is earned by the prior fusion beat. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: silence first, then co-creation, then shared being. No stock therapy-speak; the diagnostic phrase “ego death” is framed as lived history, not self-help label.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—“innovation vs. investor impracticality”—is crisp; the seed prompts one visible micro-choice (burying unmarked) that seals his stance. Emotion stays embodied (seed turning in palm, breath-held hush). Cost is present but abstract; no tangible drawback forecloses a path, so renunciation reads mild.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-rooted vocation is embodied in every micro-choice (coiling the warm cord, angling the nozzle like a baton). The contradictory pull—mournful yet hopeful—drives the entire action; the moment he freezes at the crystalline echo of laughter shows cost paid in real time. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Only the parents’ off-stage sob keeps this from full 9-band: we’re told, not shown, their shift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s contradictory impulses—yearning vs. renunciation—are dramatized in the pendant beat; the final refusal costs the only chance of return, felt in the loosened grip. Interiority is concrete (“sob catch sharp as tearing vellum”), never label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: frost-rose memory > loosen pendant > accept exile. Missing 0.3 because no second character means status crucible is absent by scope, not flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—docile apprentice vs. defiant creator—drives every micro-choice; the final vivification costs her seventy-three failures and frozen tears, anchoring change with felt price. “Stoically sensitive” is shown, not told, in her soot-stained surrender to listening. Only the bishop’s remembered voice feels external; no on-page elder applies live pressure, so status crucible is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular—“fantasy practicality” is lived, not labeled. Contradictory impulses (quest vs. renunciation) are dramatized in the final beat when she fuses the shard to the dial, foreclosing retreat. Micro-choices (discarding assumptions one by one) externalize values under pressure. Cost is visible: lifelong quest re-configured into permanent stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-choices—keying the mayday, humming the shanty—so motivation stays embodied. No interior contradiction or flaw complicates him, so the arc is flat; the cost is paid only as external spectacle, not as personal change. Still, his steady seamanship under fracturing reality feels individual and keeps the piece afloat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s through-line—“what does connection feel like?”—is clear and embodied early. However, her internal contradictions are summarized (fever dream memory vs rational architect) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice until the thread erupts; the pivot to humility is credible but the on-page cost is a single kneel-and-tear gesture, slightly under-scaled for the claimed cataclysm. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Interiority vivid, but “catharsis” is named rather than shown through body. Meets basic change test but not the high-band simultaneous contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s calm urgency and the shift from Lyra’s doubt to “oriented” conviction ring true; embodied micro-choices are mostly missing, conveyed instead through summary and Lyra’s posture. Motivation is consistent but never complicates; no interior contradiction or visible cost under pressure. Characterization feels slightly elevated-by-proxy rather than individually pitted.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete (“her curiosity a steady anchor”) and her micro-choice—pressing the hearing aid to her ear—embodies both trait and stake; the renunciation of credit at the end (“without intention or fanfare”) lands as earned cost. Only the near-perfect emotional calibration when she addresses Lily keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’ contradictory impulse—seeking freedom yet descending into confinement—anchors interiority; the grandfather motive is concrete, but the leap from “witness” to risking drowning feels slightly under-motivated. Embodied panic (knuckles, breath) is sharp, yet the final beat of serene renunciation arrives without an on-page micro-choice showing him override survival instinct. Still, the hierarchy of values (remembrance > life) is legible and costs erasure/life-risk, satisfying the 9− test.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting, shard handling, ink ritual—but the “death certificate error” backstory is delivered as label, not lived contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is waived; still, her choice to reassemble data lacks a visible alternative path, muting cost. The porcelain shard’s shift from pain to compass is cleanly dramatized, earning a modest arc. Micro-choices are present, yet motivation stays abstract (“wisdom from failure”) rather than pressing a concrete stake against her body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s vow is stated early and every tactile-aural translation beat performs it, yet her interior contradiction (fear of the curse vs. conviction) is only asserted, never dramatized in a moment that risks failure. The final renunciation—placing the cleared diamond—reads as completion, not cost, so the earned-stasis beat feels lightly charged rather than irreversible. Still, the copper-veined motif threads body, tool, and action into a singular perceptual signature, keeping her above the functional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s disgraced-scientist shame and Lyra’s half-plant serenity are sketched in vivid, contradictory flashes; the pivotal moment where Aris’s “flint-hard certainty” fractures is palpable. Interiority sometimes drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“a harmony untamed”) that softens raw contradiction. The final protective choice carries cost, but the emotional ladder leading to it is more asserted than climbed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“quiet, persistent flame,” heartbeat guiding bow—yet the final beat drifts into abstract uplift (“continuous choice to nurture wonder”) rather than a concrete, embodied cost. Micro-choices (pressing shell to chest, tearing fingers) are present, but the emotional contradiction between pain and exaltation could be simultaneous on the page instead of sequential summary. Still, motivation propels every beat and the endurance is legible; only the closing line softens the needed scar.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is grounded in the sister’s broken promise, but the interiority drifts into lyrical generality (“quiet revolution beating in his chest”) instead of dramatized contradiction. Micro-choices are present—the bottle uncorking, the flower secured—but the stakes feel abstract because no live alternative path is ever risked or forfeited on-page. The emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied; a hairline slip keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s tactile obsession with the scarf and her refusal to archive digitally are concrete, embodied motives. The micro-choice of aligning the frayed edge with the asymptotic curve crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Memory is not summarized but performed through silk texture and curvature. Cost is legible: she forfeits certainty for resonance, carrying “the library of folds within her.”

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s decade-long ache is concrete—she handles the palette, climbs the turret, chooses ratios of saffron/moonstone—but the “quiet understanding” that ends the story is articulated rather than embodied, blunting cost. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure; emotion is rendered in lyrical summary (“tears…recognition”) more than lived physiology. Still, her micro-choices read consistent and particular, and the final renunciation carries residual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation crystallizes late, after lyrical throat-clearing; the locksmith’s tics are poetic placeholders, not interior contradiction. Voice-driven empathy is asserted (“his tools were… empathy”) rather than dramatized in micro-choice under pressure; the single decisive act—pressing hair into stone—matters, but the prior beats lean on atmospheric choreography. Cost is felt more cosmetically than corporeally. Still, the arc of freeing Elara’s idea and the tear on her cheek supply credible emotional after-imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s curiosity-as-flaw is embodied through tactile ritual (sketching constellations, kneeling in mud) and charged by the recovered memory beat; the renunciation of avoidance lands with visible cost in the final release of the mushroom. Interiority stays concrete, but the single on-page line “profound release and understanding” flirts with label-speak and keeps the score just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s shard-mirror physiology and backward step are more ornament than lived constraint; the moment he “plants his feet” registers, but Elara’s shift from scoff to tracing the spiral is cleanly embodied and motivated. The mentor/student crucible tightens with visible micro-choices (tea pour, quill slide) and ends in shared stance change. Flaw: Kael’s interior contradiction is asserted via memory flash rather than enacted, keeping him just shy of full 3-D pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the luminous gold-green of wonder—remains steady and personal, but the interiority stays lyrical rather than contradictory; no clashing impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final choice (infusing the seed) is causally earned, yet the cost is more symbolic than viscerally felt on her body or future. A single micro-choice under tension would have pushed this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—scarred fingers, salt-tinged breath, the needle as extension of self—yet the “broken mask restorer” identity is asserted, never embodied in scene. Contradictory impulses (need to heal vs. fear of fracture) are implied but not dramatized in a single micro-choice; the final self-repair is declared, not tested under fresh pressure. Still, her tactile precision and the tear-tracked cheeks supply enough embodied cost to earn the quiet turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “interpreting silence with empathy” motive is concrete in every beat—she digitizes reels, overlays shadows, refuses to publish loudly—so the renunciation at the end carries felt cost. Interiority stays sensory (“rain-scoured fresco vault,” “softened into reverence”) rather than diagnostic. The only gap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; head-count itself is not penalised. Micro-choices (leaving the vault unchanged, packing tools with reverence) crystallise her hierarchy of values, earning the quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thorne’s quietly analytic armor cracks only once—when the snow-globe blizzard models the physics of surrender he has hunted—and that micro-choice credibly flips his refusal to release Elara into an earned, costly stasis. Contradictory impulses (clinging vs. cataloguing viscosity) coexist in-scene, not in summary; the final image carries visible cost: the stone in his chest settles, foreclosing endless grief-recursion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—giving voice to the voiceless—is stated lyrically but never tested or contradicted; she undergoes no interior friction, cost, or shift. The flower-press bolt plate is handled, yet its emotional history stays abstract; no micro-choice risks failure or reveals a blind spot. Because the piece is purely observational, she remains a luminous vessel rather than a flawed agent whose limits compound.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s curiosity is anchored in a concrete memory of Lyra’s seed-box, giving his decryption attempt emotional stakes. The beat where he dons the goggles is micro-choice that tilts present risk; the moment he reads the captain’s decoded grief, interiority and embodied reaction ("throat tightened") show contradictory impulses—duty vs. longing—alive in scene. Final stance of "carrying wisdom" is earned; cost is felt through the shift from detached courier to bearer of another’s grief. No secondary on-page character, so status crucible skipped; -0.2 for slight convenience of perfect cipher fit first try.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—panic prayed against via brass telescope, tears blurring eyepiece yet vision “crystalline.” Contradiction pulses: scientist’s taxonomic drive vs. grieving lover’s need for presence-in-absence, both active in the same micro-choices. Final inscription carries earned cost: accepting the hole-as-portrait forecloses denial, completing the promise to “keep looking up.” Voice slips once into diagnostic self-label (“cathartic release”) but recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s face-blindness and tactile gift are dramatized through micro-choices—tracing the coin replaces seeing the sky—so the renunciation feels earned. The final turn (“carrying the entire sky in the palm”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she abandons twenty years of mural work without therapeutic self-talk. Interior contradiction is present—rage at impermanence vs. reverence for limits—embodied in the tremor that pauses her hand on the cerulean spine. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics inert.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “diligently curious” trait is repeatedly dramatized—cross-referencing logs, kneeling to sketch shadows, whispering translations—so the final choice feels inevitable. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse quickened,” “tears welled”) without therapy-speak. One contradiction beat is missing: she never doubts or weighs risk, so the climb feels friction-free. Still, the orb-restoration moment carries visible cost in solitude-turned-embrace, earning credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—tool selection, breath rhythm, tactile memory—all grounding her motive. The “rhythm of repair” turns from nostalgia to embodied method, earning her final tears. No contradictory impulses appear mid-action, but the gear swap feels frictionless; a hint of hesitation would sharpen the cost. Still, the mentor’s absence-as-pressure suffuses every beat, so the arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Seven named characters is a crowd at 800 words; only Kael and Lena get micro-choices, the rest are labels. Elara’s altruism is asserted, not tested—she never risks or loses anything. The family’s “single organism” is declared, not dramatized in contradictory action; interiority stays general (“tears mingling with smiles”). Earned stasis is present but thin because the ghost’s exit carries no visible cost to the living.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s millennia-long solitude and the lullaby memory give her a sharp, personal stake; the embodied moment of “pouring the lullaby’s memory” into the pane shows contradictory impulses—duty vs. exhaustion—on the page. The final smile and collapsed posture visibly pay the cost of her choice, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only limit: no second character on stage, so relationship crucible and status shifts aren’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s reluctant caretaker status, blood-oath, and “offhandedly exact” precision are dramatized through micro-choices (plucking the nut, turning it exactly three-quarters). Internal contradiction—instinct to flee vs. duty—acts live in scene, embodied in gravel-grinding boots and pocketing the blueprint. Closure’s “stubborn grace” is earned by prior causality with visible nightly cost. Single-POV keeps interiority concrete; no dialogue dilutes voice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aris’s grief-driven interiority is specific and embodied; the “symphonic” lens differentiates him. Yet the decisive shift—from rigid chains to braided networks—leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“His entire philosophy had been flawed”) rather than a micro-choice under pressure. The cost is present but intellectualized, not viscerally enacted. Still, the arc is credible within the lyrical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for origin yet worshipping void—remains vivid; the act of “quantifying absence” externalizes her micro-choices with tactile precision. Embodied cost arrives when the first incision brands the slate and the parole flares, foreclosing pure emptiness. One character, no status crucible, but the earned renunciation of untouched blankness carries sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete—kitchen discipline anchoring the surreal gift—and the embodied cost of tasting exile’s regret lands cleanly. The micro-choice to “cook” remorse fuses vocation and wound, earning the stoic final stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; solo arc holds. Minor slip: “sandpaper rough memories” is repeated label-speak near climax, dulling edge −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation and empathy are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—polishing the brass weight, matching language to gear fatigue—so her decisive turn feels earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9 is that the cost to her is implied rather than embodied in a final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—engineering order vs. emotional surrender—are alive in every beat; her decision to keep returning crystallizes a credible renunciation of her former life. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: mirror handling > breathing > ascent, each carrying visible cost. The only drag: a few abstractions (“quaking reverie,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) edge toward diagnostic-speak, slightly blunting embodiment at peak. Still, the interior arc compels and forecloses the old path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s prism-mind is vividly interiorized through sensory synesthesia and micro-choices (tracing moss, tears cutting dust). The decades-long quest is embodied, not declared, and the final “latent blaze” crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “gentle, persistent ache” and synesthetic hearing of silence as a “dissonant chord” are specific and embodied. The single on-page choice—strumming the cracks—grows credibly from that ache and lands with visible cost (tears, siskin response). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, only a steady deepening of attention, so the 9+ internal-conflict gate isn’t met. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy is legible and costly enough for 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s exile, tactile ritual with the stone, and refusal to weaponise chess cohere into a believable interior. His “discipline forged in royal chambers” externalises as micro-choices—rooted boots, thumb tracing the dent—that embody the thirty-year pressure; the final turn east is earned because the nexus translation dramatises how principled silence now directs him. Only a hairline slip: the tear-and-dust image edges toward performed emblem rather than raw fracture, keeping it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist-healer identity is vivid—mending wings, whispering to doors—yet her interior contradictions surface only in generic “tapestry of love and loss” strokes, not in scene-level micro-choices. The empathic leap into Mr. Henderson’s skin is declared, not dramatized; we’re told she “was” him, but no bodily or vocal shift marks the merger. Still, the final renunciation—silent porch-sitting instead of exposition—earns credible cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her olfactory gift drives every beat and the final renunciation feels earned. The contradiction between ambition and olfactory revulsion is held in scene, not summarized. No secondary character appears, so relationship tests are waived. Cost is visible in the moment she accepts the future stench as “honest story.”

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive (save the groves) is clear and constant; the arrow-tip’s warming gives tactile micro-feedback that keeps desire embodied. Interiority stays rooted in sensory cues—water ribbons, phantom rain—so emotion never drifts into label-speak. The final renunciation (“not to harvest, but to protect”) is credibly earned by the pool-test with the twig, showing cost on the page. What keeps this from the 9-band is the absence of live contradictory impulse: once the arrow glows he follows without hesitation or temptation to exploit the source, so pressure never complicates his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—“to cultivate foresight in action”—is dramatized through every micro-choice: anemometer placement, patch pocketed, log amended. The memory of his cockpit failure is anchored to a physical cue (the sleeve patch) and alters present risk assessment, giving interior contradiction lived weight. Final renunciation—carrying Croft’s patch as compass, not burden—pays the cost of shared identity and forecloses repetition. Voice remains particular, never diagnostic; competence is balanced by visible emotional bleed at the discovery of the twin patch.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—aching to prove “awe as vital as air” while fearing the ritual might fail—stays embodied in trembling grip, frozen tears, the synesthetic overload that forces her to shut her eyes. Micro-choices (mallet delay, breath sync with aurora, the final white strike) map a clear value hierarchy. Cost is certified: exhaustion, tear-cicles, the cavern’s irreversible hum. Could edge higher if an earlier flaw or physical price limited her strikes instead of pure spiritual certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s regret-driven return is vivid, but the interiority drifts into paraphrase loops (“harvest insights from failure” echoed three ways). The embodied moment when his scarred hands select driftwood shows contradiction—reverence vs. self-reproach—yet later beats slip into diagnostic label-speak (“failure was… deafness”). Final renunciation lands with visible cost (leaving markers, lighter spirit), but the causal trail from pride → fracture → humility is compressed into one epiphany line rather than dramatized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s transposed empathy ignites every turn; the borrowed grief and joy are viscerally embodied in posture, breath, pulse. Interior contradiction peaks when philosopher’s grief slams into poet’s joy—identity frays live on the page. Micro-choice to skew the type and clutch the halo fragment reifies her hierarchy: comprehension > self-preservation. Closure cost is unmistakable: she forecloses pure objectivity, embracing turbulent integration—Charged Poise lands with a genuine, non-borrowed smile.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s jitter-to-calm arc is embodied through trembling hands, the pendant clutch, and final steady stride; the interior contradiction between duty and wonder is dramatized, not declared. Cost is visible: the luminous plant roots in the spot where his grief once sat. Missing micro-choice under midsentence pressure keeps it from 9—he never actively decides to vibrate, the pendant does it for him.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“sharp eyes missed no detail,” “breath steady, focus absolute”), motivation is consistent, and the micro-shift from certainty to humility is earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the turn is recognition-only, so the 9-test is missed. The single-POV, one-character frame fits scope; no status dynamics required.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s yearning for a fifty-year-gone man is palpable and constant; every beat on the loom is micro-chosen from that wound, giving her interiority a single, credible spine. Yet the only on-page contradiction we see is wistful sorrow itself—no clashing hunger or anger complicates the shuttle, so the arc risks one-note. The final self-sacrifice is causally prepared: she empties her present life thread by thread to power the weave, so the cost is earned and visible. She fulfills the 9+ test, but barely: a second interior contradiction (terror of vanishing, say) would have lifted her into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s “quietly determined” resolve is shown only once, at the climax; the rest is summary. No contradictory interior impulse is dramatized in-scene, so interiority is flat until the final beat. The sacrifice of his wife’s laughter is told, not felt in body, muting emotional cost. Still, the micro-choice to pour spirit into the silk is embodied and stakes a visible path, earning a modest arc of strength.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—needing truth yet fearing its weight—drives every beat; the shift from accusation to compassion is micro-modeled in her breath-choices and palm-pressure on the shard. Emotions are embodied in shudders, grit-in-boots, vacuum-leached air; no diagnostic labels. Her cyclically spontaneous ability is not merely named but enacted: the tide overtakes her, recedes, then forces her to recalibrate intent under threat of oblivion. Final endurance—accepting the weight as foundation—costs her the clean grief of blame and is earned by the prior resonance failures she viscerally maps.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and observant nature are shown through tactile micro-choices (dismantling the stack, selecting stones) that externalize inner stakes; the “bottle safety” motive is dramatized in the final stacking act with visible cost (the ache). Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of deepest grief is slightly abstracted (“luminescent ache blending sorrow…”) rather than embodied in contradictory impulse, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s guarded silence vs. irrepressible laugh embodies live contradiction; the accidental-prophecy flaw is dramatized in-scene (one snort → storm) and costs him solitude. Micro-steering choices embody “quiet fire” motive and hierarchy of values—control over comfort. Final renunciation of recognition (“no headline”) is earned, visible, poignant. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, though secondary pressure is minimal due to solo cast.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the donor-heart beat anchors every micro-choice. The shift from “collect stories” to “create space” is credible, but the moment of irrevocable renunciation is softly voiced rather than dramatized under pressure, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with arboreal memory is vivid, but her interiority stays lyrical rather than contradictory; no moment shows her fearing the cost of success or doubting the sextant’s price. The final shift from “trimmer” to “listener” is signaled early yet earns credible weight because the repaired lens physically re-channels her vocation. Still, her emotional palette is steady-state wonder; a sharper internal micro-choice under moonlight (hesitation, guilt over trespassing on grief) would have deepened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority—fractured loom memory, quiet ember motive—remains specific and embodied; the singing beats show contradictory impulses (fragility vs determination) under rising pressure. Her micro-choice to release the final note costs the century of vigil and is earned by the causal chain of song-swaddle-dawn. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; keeper role is shown through ritual action, not label. Memory fragments integrate into present tension without diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus longing to rejoin—are rendered through tactile micro-choices (smoothing the invitation, lighting the candle) and embodied memory. The final renunciation of physical presence is earned because the astral eavesdropping beat dramatizes forgiveness first. Interiority occasionally drifts toward self-help register (“enlarged tranquility”), trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “creeping normality noticer” vocation is vividly embodied through sensory memory and micro-choices; the pocket crust anchors her interiority and shapes her decision to plant. The contradiction between grief and hope is played out in gesture rather than label, and her final choice to embrace resilience is earned through the shared bread beat. Interiority stays concrete, though the moment of absolution is slightly over-articulated (“understood then: the sacred lived…”), edging toward epiphany-speak. Still, the embodied arc and visible cost lift it above competent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s “gentle meticulous” trait is repeatedly asserted but never complicates her choices or exacts a cost; interiority remains abstract (“burned with quiet urgency,” “felt warm with purpose”) rather than embodied under pressure. The final image of her turning to the next slide crystallizes Earned Stasis, yet the stakes feel intellectual rather than personally costly because the vow’s loss is external to her life.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory obligations—preserve the truce yet document its fracture—are embodied in every micro-choice; the watch-fob recording and final intervention both spring from that tension. The “curiously steadfast” trait is dramatized rather than labeled, driving three visible false starts plus the climactic exposure. Closure costs her the fantasy of pure observation: she must step into the fray and claim authorship of peace, forfeiting anonymity. Father-haunted interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapeutic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradiction—luminous skin vs. skeptical mind—remains embodied through every beat; the tongue-taste mechanic externalizes doubt and lets micro-choices (ring on, step forward) visibly escalate. The shift from cool silver to warm gold encodes earned change without explanatory filler, and the private rain inside the stone circle exacts a physical cost for her new belief. Grandmother’s voice is used only as remembered trigger, not as corrective exposition, keeping knowledge strictly character-bound. Interiority stays specific to her POV; no diagnostic self-talk dilutes the final conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s gifted recall and charcoal-stained hands are vividly embodied; the decision to sketch on calcite is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc. The final beat—pocketing the new charcoal—shows a credible, earned shift from paralysis to renewed vocation. Lily remains off-page; no relationship crucible required. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserve truth vs. wilt near lies—are dramatized in her trembling brush and steady final hand; the child’s candor and neighbor’s confession give embodied pressure that turns the trait into action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The earned renunciation of archival obsession costs her the fantasy of a vault and lands as visible steadiness, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the absence of on-page relationships keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation and muteness form a taut inner contradiction that powers every beat; her tactile tuning and silent perception embody motive without exposition. The elders’ signed plea anchors her resolve, and her final touch on the spent fragment crystallizes earned stasis—she forecloses speech yet pays nothing in on-page loss, capping the arc just short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Unit Seven’s interior contradiction—machine precision vs. nostalgic ache—is dramatized in the micro-choice to burn rather than archive; the milk-tooth glow beat embodies cost. Memory fracturing under geomagnetic static justifies the stakes shift. The final posture (“nurture, remember, heal”) is earned by prior causality, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “quiet vow” is stated, not dramatized; interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“listening heals the fractures time leaves”). The final gesture—inserting the key—aligns with her stated motive, yet the lack of visible internal contradiction or micro-choice under pressure keeps her short of full individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific, her danced lexicon embodying contradiction under pressure; the vow to “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through micro-choices that cost her isolation and grime-tears, earning the final quiet rebellion. No stock labels—every beat is filtered through her perceptual loom. Flaw: we never feel her body fail or mis-remember under water-cold stress; competence edges toward immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s ache for her erased sister is palpable in the wildflowers and every micro-choice to climb, touch, and whisper; the salt-geode surrender feels earned because her calloused fingers and sailor reflexes have already bled intention earlier. Still, interiority flirts with poetic labels (“gleaming silence”) that slightly generalise corporeal specificity at peak beat, holding her just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—“quiet urgency,” “tranquil blaze”—but her contradictions never collide in a single micro-choice; she glides rather than struggles. The final exhalation is beautiful yet foregone, so the cost feels aesthetic, not personal. Still, the voice-specific perception and anchored memory of the mentor’s wing keep her above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her shift from “interrogate stone” to “understand soul” lands via embodied beats (tracing wax, cup warmth). Yet the dead tutor remains off-page memory; Mrs. Davison functions as gentle oracle rather than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is soft. Still, her micro-choice to accept the seal carries visible cost of stewardship. Final renunciation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—empiricist performing a ritual—drives every beat; the micro-choice to hum C while tears fall embodies the stakes. The final burial of the shell beneath Kael’s lilac is a credibly costly renunciation. Only the “ghostly resolve” label at climax nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Kael’s contradictory motives—guilt over betrayal versus love for the spared children—coexist in-scene and culminate in the thorn/key micro-choice that visibly costs him the relics. Interiority stays concrete (“chains of guilt begin to unlink—link by link, memory by memory”), avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation is earned because the ritual mechanics force surrender of both objects and of the identity tethered to them.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—uncovering why certain voices haunt the canyon—drives every step; her sensory acuity is shown, not told, and the final act of song is a credible renunciation with embodied cost. Interior contradiction is light (no visible self-interests collide), and the single-POV keeps pressure personal. The earned release lands because her earlier listening skills foreshadow her power to un-knot echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, reverence-driven motivation is vivid and consistent; her interiority is textured through sensory anchoring in ice and candlelight. The final choice—to write Lena and reframe Clara’s death as gift—grows believably from her established need to “salvage something pure.” Yet because no second character shares the scene, relationship pressure is absent and the cost is purely empathic rather than personal, keeping her just shy of the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philosopher’s knot-tying and whistle are embodied micro-choices that externalize his interior arc; the “demure audacity” stance is credibly maintained and paid for in the final image. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the through-line of attention-as-mending is specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s skeptical patience and the decisive shift to guardianship are grounded in clear micro-choices (kneeling, re-burying), but the swing from “disprove everything” to “protect the lie” is stated more than embodied; a single tremor of visible hesitation or sensory recoil would have made the cost bite.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“salvation slept in the geometry of forgotten things” feels hers—but she never makes a scene-level micro-choice; the solstice success is off-stage, so the cost and change are only reported. The “lyrically prophetic” trait stays ornamental; no contradictory impulse complicates her broadcast. We’re told her isolation ends, yet she takes no on-page action to earn that shift. Voice is distinct, but motivation never sharpens into a stakes-bearing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vagrant penny poet’s yearning to “translate between generations” is viscerally embodied in the cracked music-box moment; his trembling repair and sealing of the jar crystallize a hierarchy of values (grandmother’s lullaby > own exile). Interiority stays concrete—“tears traced paths through the dust”—without therapeutic self-diagnosis. The only minor slack: the final paragraph rehearses motive already earned, slightly diluting the cost’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s dual lens—engineer’s precision versus empathic attunement—drives every micro-adjustment and is paid off in the tactile filing of the key. Interior contradiction is dramatized through bodily pressure (eyes, chest) rather than abstract labels, and the final earned stasis is visible when the warm key becomes a “living extension,” foreclosing further action for the night. Flaws are limited: competence dominates struggle, and the lineage motive is stated more than tested. A hairline slip: “logically emotional” is self-diagnosed rather than enacted in first beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into patience—drives every beat; the final palm-press is earned by seven winters of recorded vigilance. Embodied emotion (“trembling only with reverence”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent. Cost is legible: her former urgency dissolves into “abiding patience as solid as the sanctuary stones,” a permanent stance shift. Missing 9+ only because no second character pressures her to test status or force visible mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s guarded interiority is specific and embodied; the lantern-triggered empathic surge lets contradictory impulses (empathy vs empirical duty) collide in-scene. Her micro-choice to bag the lantern as evidence crystallizes her hierarchy of values and carries visible cost—she shoulders the entangled grief. The reflective blocks are tethered to present stimuli (wet knee, lantern touch) and tilt her next action, satisfying BRR. Only minor slip: “fortified vulnerability” is named once in self-diagnosis rather than shown through asymmetrical action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt and Samuel’s posthumous directive drive every beat; the micro-choice to seek Horvath is embodied, not declared. Interiority stays concrete—“weight a physical echo,” “tears traced clean paths”—without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of guilt-as-debt is earned because the prior repair beat visibly forecloses self-punishment and re-purposes his vocation. Only minor cap: we never see Elias make an actual mistake in prison; the flaw is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s irreverent-curious voice is distinct and embodied; her micro-choices (wink at brass, bow to Algorithm, rag-wipe tears) externalize contradictory awe vs. control. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Final laugh/tears crystallize earned endurance with visible cost on her grease-streaked cheeks. No second character, so status/relationship bullets waived—single-POV arc cleanly closed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through pattern-hunting and the lie she sustains; the moment she encrypts Psi and accepts guardianship crystallizes a costly, earned shift. The interior contradiction—obedient employee vs clandestine protector—plays out in concrete micro-choices. Flaw: Lena appears only in video, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics cannot score. Final renunciation is credible and scaled to word-count.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is lyrical but keeps distance; “map empathy onto action” is stated, not embodied. Calm intuition stays static—no contradiction undercuts it—so the final act feels preordained rather than earned. Shadow-laced body is vivid, yet no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with cost; kneeling and planting read as ritual, not risky decision.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and body-anchored; the parasol tip as tactile anchor works. Shift from suicidal curiosity to communal belonging is legible, but the final beat still leans on abstract summation (“peace,” “solace”) rather than a single irrevocable act that locks the change. Cost is felt yet not crystallized in an on-page forfeiture. Voice stays coherent; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s calm-root metaphor and micro-choice to hand over the relic land cleanly; Clara and Liam’s silent shift from rigidity to hand-drift is credible, but their interiority is filtered through Elara’s lyricism, blurring contradictory impulses in-scene and capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kael’s creed-driven refusal to doctor the echo is dramatized in body-level micro-choices (the boot-to-parapet dance, the eye-softening), and the tear-on-dust moment embodies cost without label-speak. Interior contradiction is vivid: reverence vs. physical exhaustion, honesty vs. the temptation to “capture” the echo. The renunciation of direct focus is earned through prior causal setup and forecloses future ease; it’s an earned stasis that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s calm-archivist persona is vivid and consistent; her interiority filters every beat. The micro-choice to show Liam the laughing-women photo crystallizes her method and costs her nothing, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible. No contradictory impulse or personal stake is risked, so the “puzzle” trait remains decorative. Still, the town’s healing is legibly tied to her orchestration, satisfying the length’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aris’ reticence, scholar-stance, and “weathered innocence” are shown through embodied ritual, not label; the micro-choice to climb the ladder and restore the crystal is the decisive beat that fuses motive, flaw, and cost. Interiority stays character-bound (“weight of centuries on shoulders,” dust on cheeks). The lack of any second character keeps relationship bullets inapplicable, but the single POV remains coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fleeting visions while knowing they’ll vanish—are dramatized in every chalk mark and driftwood placement; the final renunciation of remembering is earned through these tactile rituals, costing her the very vision she sought. Interiority is consistently concrete (“ghost on her skin,” “hollow shape of longing”). Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship pressure off the page, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s laconic, oil-stained calm and “forty years of repair” listening are vivid, but interiority tips into self-explicative thesis (“escape velocity not as a physicist’s equation, but as a soul’s threshold”) rather than simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The decisive micro-choice—pressure “softer than breath” on the mainspring—grows from established craft patience, earning her renunciation of force, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied. Flaw is present (mechanistic empathy) but safely hedged; no relational crucible on stage, so status dynamics bullet waived.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s decisive kindness is shown, not told, through her choice to honor the shard; Arthur and Lena’s micro-choices (covering the shard together) embody earned reconfiguration. Interiority is concrete—Lena’s “grief a stone in her throat,” Arthur’s silent lip-moving—without diagnostic labels. The only drag: “decisively kind eyes” is a gestural shortcut that slightly blurs Elara’s internal contradiction; still, the final hand-clasp is proportionally scaled to 700 words and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quietly deliberate patience is dramatized through ink-stained fingers, steady chalk work, and the refusal to flinch when gears jam; the interior contradiction between scholarly calm and obsessive drive is shown, not told. The final tear-streaked moment crystallizes a personal cost—her solitude, the seasons lost—so the closure feels earned. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the single-POV interiority remains coherent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—grieving mother vs. clinical bone-setter—remains concrete and embodied; the moment she spots the hairline cleft in the tooth is a micro-choice that re-weights her entire stance with visible cost (liberation/sob). Her “shrewd innocence” is shown, not told, through tactile handling of props and steady refusal to punish the village. One minor slip: “mistakes into constellations” drifts toward thesis-speak, but it is brief and quickly re-anchored in sensory action. Earned renunciation of vengeance lands under inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is tactile and specific (the knee ache, the glass warming in her palm), but the only micro-choice on stage is “continue polishing.” The stakes never test an alternative path, so her contradictory impulses stay latent. No cost is visibly foregone; the closure is pure gift. Still, the embodied memories and occupational detail keep her above the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the amber press and whispered renunciation embody contradictory impulses on the page. The only drag is a touch of therapy-speak ("I honor the truth of my regret...") mid-ceremony that momentarily flattens embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but remains abstract (“solemn quest,” “nihilism demanded by publishers”) rather than dramatized through bodily cost under pressure; no contradictory impulse is enacted inside a single beat, so the arc is observational rather than transformational. The seashell press-to-temple ritual is repeated without escalating consequence; the final “quiet, purposeful peace” is declared, not earned via a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s quiet but fierce motivation is clear, yet the interiority stays safely abstract ("warm and embracing," "certainty") instead of embodying contradiction or cost; her single micro-choice (return tendril) is gentle, not bearing visible price that forecloses a path. She remains competent and unflawed, so no mistake compounds tension; the arc is linear restoration, not personal reckoning. Earned stasis is achieved, but the absence of internal friction or tangible sacrifice keeps the characterization from high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s desire tofix heartbeat into map is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical tag-lines (“antithesis of her craft”) that tell rather than dramatize contradiction. She makes only one true micro-choice—offering the blood-drop—so the arc feels more ritual than tested character under pressure. The single bud swelling supplies external proof, yet no internal cost or contradiction is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet, method-driven interiority is consistent and particular; his refusal to force a solution but instead “listen with his eyes” embodies a believable, profession-rooted stance. The micro-choice to craft the pin only after the reflection-revelation shows interior contradiction (precision vs. patience) under pressure. Cost is felt: he seals the vials with a chest-tight pulse, foreclosing the option to keep the season’s wonder raw. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; even the cellar metaphor stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s solemn vow and tactile weaving give her a clear, consistent motive, but the interiority stays safely meditative; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates her on-page choices, so the “earned cost” bar for 8+ isn’t met.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, the scar on her wrist—yet the “hauntingly practical” trait is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices; the final carving decision feels pre-ordained rather than wrested under fresh pressure, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scavenger pragmatism vs. salvaged idealism—are dramatized in the wheel-turning beats; the final self-merge carries visible cost (“tears welled”) and is earned by the prior accumulation of voices. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the micro-choice to offer the wheel as “understanding” rather than weapon crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The ghost functions as externalized interior conflict, satisfying the “relationship as crucible” test without head-count bloat. Flaw: “I was afraid of the height of my own dream” edges toward diagnostic self-explanation, but the embodied regret weighting every step keeps it above the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s soil-stained boots and “poetry in stress calculations” give tactile, specific interiority; the sextant protractor beat shows micro-choice under pressure. Motivation stays steady, but the final equation is declared rather than dramatized with cost, keeping her short of full contradiction. Still, her functional creativity visibly shapes tactics—no convenient amnesia, no stock labels—so the arc earns credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—clock-oil-stained fingers, trembling precision—and her contradictory longing/renunciation pulses in-scene. The tuning-fork gesture externalizes her split desire; the tear is earned. Micro-choice (leaving the fork) visibly forecloses return. Cost is scaled to length; still, “excruciatingly gentle” italicizes self-awareness twice, nudging therapeutic label territory.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“calloused finger traced the rim”); motivation remains steady. The decisive turn—choosing documentation over vengeance—could use one beat of visible cost (a tremor, a hesitation) to earn full 9-band; still, contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene and the renunciation is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—patience is embodied in breath-ghosts and slow finger-work on rope, not declared. The final renunciation (“the seed was merely the vessel”) is earned because her earlier tactile decoding has already demonstrated reverence for method over relic. No contradictory impulse is shown under pressure, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair. Fisherman’s silence-as-trust supplies minimal but sufficient status shift to satisfy relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-mapping motive is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“sacred geography… soul”) that blurs concrete contradiction; the thread-cued vision grants her knowledge without a micro-choice that costs her anything, so the final “compass” feels bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—clutching the egg while haunted by “flawed genesis”—live in the scene: his hands shake, the tear is placed, the whispered phrase costs him breath. Thirty years of solitude condense into the micro-choice to accept the spectral bird; the feather’s warmth is the paid-for renunciation. Interiority rarely slips into label-speak; instead, grime on tears and threadbare velvet show the cost. The only drag is the off-stage mechanical world, keeping secondary pressure abstract; still, his final stance is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is poetic but stays embodied; the graft micro-choice at the lagoon crystallizes her contradictory impulses (heal vs. inherit) with visible cost—the coin/kelp burial. Emotional arcs trace credible irrationality: shame, love, duty collide without tidy resolution. Flaws (arsonist blood) actively complicate the final ritual, satisfying earned stasis. 9+ blocked only because the father’s voice flashback lapses into paraphrased wisdom rather than fresh, specific diction.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s “luminous skeptic” tension is dramatized in micro-choices—she pockets the river stone only after a skeptical finger-test, then surrenders a coin with visible breath-held cost. Interiority stays concrete (“doubt whispered—fool’s errand”) rather than label-speak, and the final stance crystallizes through earned pattern-verification, not epiphany. Flaws complicate: her need for proof slows the ritual, forcing a last-moment risk. The arc lands in credible renunciation—she accepts custodianship, not victory—priced by dust-streaked tears.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific and emotionally embodied; the gear-handling micro-choices visibly enact her ancestral dread. The "fireless" imperative is anchored to a concrete family scar, giving her renunciation at the end a hereditary cost that feels earned. Voice remains consistent, but the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics off the table, slightly thinning the crucible pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is granular and embodied—her scarred hands, the ribbon’s texture against her palm, the way dusk “bled indigo”—and her micro-choice to retrace the family poem ritual directly seeds the memorial design. The contradiction between stone’s permanence and grief’s fluidity is held in her body throughout. Lyra functions as externalized conscience, not a second character, so relationship crucible doesn’t apply. Final renunciation of a monolithic monument is earned and costly: she forsakes the safety of a single “answer” for a living path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior discipline and generational duty feel lived-in; the tactile memory of the rake handle and the pendulum push reveal a believable hierarchy of values. However, the pendulum-vision grants her an almost perfect moral clarity that slightly flattens the cost of her final choice—no lingering doubt or new burden is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s gentle perseverance is credible, but the interiority stays decorative (“blithe spirit,” “tenderly organized heart”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No micro-choice after the first thread-pull risks passivity; the final resolve is asserted, not earned under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—doubt vs disciplined certainty—is dramatized in one continuous beat (“She closed her eyes, mentally retracing…”), then crystallizes into the poised hand that forecloses retreat; the cost (personal culpability if the lake fractures wrong) is felt but not yet embodied in loss, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and particular—Elara’s needle-and-ink precision, her pulse “frantic drum,” the dust-mote sermon all body forth a compulsive archivist. Contradictory impulse (fear vs. vow) is present but stays largely parallel rather than colliding inside a single beat; the final stance is earned yet cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Still, voice, sensorium, and micro-choices cohere into an individual psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her tactile ritual choices reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The contradiction between her stated purpose (“release”) and her meticulous control crystallizes in the final scatter, earning a credible renunciation. No stock phrasing; every micro-choice (powdering one shard, brushing dust into the silver bowl) is character-specific. Cost is visible: the stilled chair and the ash map on its seat foreclose any redo.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s contradictory interiority—rational custodian vs. solitary zealot—surfaces in the trembling hands that still catalogue with “deliberate care.” The brass cog, handled twice with distinct symbolic weight, anchors a hierarchy of values visible in the micro-choice to hide the tablet. The renunciation costs him the immediate vindication he has scavenged ten years for; that forfeiture is felt in the closing image of the brush hovering over the next layer. No stock labels; every emotional beat is embodied in silt-stained fingers, oilcloth, and the drip that measures his new temporal currency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—resigned yet expectant—grounds every micro-choice; the rosette warms in her pocket as embodied cost. Choir members’ shifts from avoidance to steadying harmony are shown through tactile细节 (hand-brush, tear) rather than labels. Final stance crystallizes when she pockets the warmed wood, continuity replacing loss. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” recurs as label; dramatized once, still palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Arlo’s synesthetic tasting of memory is vivid and unique; every pruning snip carries embodied cost. Interior contradiction surfaces when tasting joy beside grief, yet the arc remains a linear ascent rather than a struggle between competing values. The final smile feels slightly unearned because no flaw or misbelief complicates his success—he executes the plan exactly as intended. Still, the specificity of “tasting a bride’s laughter” keeps him alive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s involuntary candor is dramatized under pressure; the micro-choice to hand over the lacquer box enacts both duty and grandfather-loyalty. Interior contradiction is legible: he dreads yet welcomes the coming reveal. Cost is felt when his private cathedral of wonder is exposed to bureaucratic eyes and must survive on poetry, not data. Trait governs every beat; no stock therapy-speak; final ember of satisfaction is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is vivid in the opening beats, but the interior contradiction promised never arrives; she moves from passive watching to passive placement of the shard without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The final “quiet blaze” insight is asserted, not dramatized through body or risk, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s interiority is stone-cold specific: “mineral tears traced paths through algae” embodies grief without labels. Contradictory impulses—the need to expose truth vs. fear of shattering the city—coexist in the same beats, driving every micro-choice. The final resolve to let the fracture sing costs him his own granite certainty, felt when “currents of change flowed through his own granite veins.” Full 9+ blocked only because no second character presses back, so status crucible is absent by scope.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction—“grim optimist”—is embodied in the compulsive climb and the chipped die she keeps rolling; every micro-choice (sharpen flint, etch, absorb the rupture instead of stepping through) flows from the same fused regret/hope engine. A visible cost is paid when she renounces egress and recommits to the stairs, proving the arc is earned. The only keep-away from 9 is slight over-articulation of her emotional summary at climax (“beauty persisted within broken systems”).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s insomnia, painter identity, and “methodically hopeful” trait are cleanly embodied through tactile ritual; the internal contradiction between exhaustion and compulsive creation is shown, not labeled. The final quiet renunciation—insomnia reframed as vigil—carries visible emotional cost and is earned by the prior causal chain. No second on-page character means relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices (grinding saffron, placing canvas) reveal value hierarchy. Voice remains particular, never sliding into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s quiet-fire motive and historically-attuned perception drive every beat; the micro-choice to hand Hemlock the lens crystallizes her agency and seeds the communal turn. Interiority stays concrete—opera-glass weight, scent of maple-sap bread—without diagnostic self-talk. The final “E” loaf she accepts carries visible cost: she shifts from observer to participant, forfeiting detached safety. Only the elders’ grief is summarized; a single embodied beat of their resistance would have pushed this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the stone’s warning vs. compulsion to invert it—surface in the decisive moment of lever-pulling; the tear-streaked cheeks embody the visible cost of her renunciation of linear fate, fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation—conquer fear by exposing its weakness—remains steady and sharp; interiority is concrete (“shards of ice in his throat”). Yet the advisor’s contradictory impulses (need to dominate vs. offer his own emptiness) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat, and the cost of his final gift—trading cursed void for human outline—feels lightly earned because the story never shows him fearing that loss. Still, the renunciation is legible and character-bound, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Leeward’s vocation and embodied calm feel lived-in; every strike of the mallet is a micro-choice that visibly sharpens the cost of failure. Memory of a drowned coast gives the final earned stasis a bone-deep ache. Interiority stays anchored to salt, wood, and sound—no generic prophet clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s quietly driven focus is not a label; it is dramatized by her solitary return from the doomed expedition and by her years of patient pattern-work on the gate. Her only micro-choice—playing the reed whistle at the exact resonant angle—unlocks the transformation, and the cost is legible in the tear-tracked salt she walks across. The contradiction between her fear of the Watchers’ judgment and her unslaked curiosity is held in scene, not abstracted. Her final stance as “the question itself” crystallizes an earned, visible cost: she crosses alone, Kael’s voice still lost behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s “emotionally rational” trait is shown through calm parallel-drawing rather than eruptive feeling, but interiority stays abstract (“felt the precise moment,” “heart swelled”) without bodily contradiction; the vow is clear, the micro-choice (reading aloud, ribboning the letter) is present, and the cost (loss of comforting myth) is legibly felt, so the arc is earned if not viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradiction—duty vs. dream-excavation—stays present in each micro-choice (prying stone, uncorking inkwell), but the interiority leans on lyrical summary (“hushed blaze”) rather than moment-to-moment embodiment under rising time pressure. Still, the final renunciation (leaving before the lake returns) costs him the pavilion’s visibility, so the arc earns its stoic endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, methodical drive is embodied in every micro-gesture; the moment she flips the stamp to its blank end and presses the Deep-Singer sigil, her interior contradiction—obedience to archival protocol vs allegiance to buried truth—crystallizes with visible cost. The beat earns its emotional weight because her earlier sensory attention (paper weave, watermark glow) has already made the reader complicit in the discovery. No stock labels, no safety-hedging; her competence is balanced by the solitary risk she accepts. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost is intellectual rather than bodily or relational, slightly softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief is embodied through tactile lantern-work and the paper-fold ritual; contradictory impulses (cling/release) live in the same micro-gestures. The final tear is earned because every crane has compressed visible cost on the page. Voice keeps interiority concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Only cap is the solitary POV—no relational crucible on stage—so the full 9-band “contradictory-impulse-in-scene” gate is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s grief is viscerally embodied (scarred fingers, marrow-pressure) and her micro-choice— one precise mental nudge—launches the entire plot; the interior contradiction between hunting truth and fearing its weight is alive in every beat. No other characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A; the endurance she earns (“ready to listen”) is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The flaw that she can’t stop picking at the wound is the engine, not a decorative label. Voice never slips into therapy-speak; “bleak exhilaration” is shown via the geode’s hum and tear-paths, not asserted. 9+ gate missed only because the final stance crystallizes without a fresh micro-choice in the last 60 words; cost is felt but not dramatized anew.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s isolation and need for “belonging” are anchored early and embodied in the tremor when he slots the chip; Elara’s perpetual wonder is shown through gasps and softened tears, not just labeled. The final hand-clasp is a credible, earned micro-choice that dissolves his solitude, paying the emotional cost on the page. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s guilt is rendered through concrete sensory anchors (snagged thumb, splinters) and a single irrevocable micro-choice—clutching the watch-hand carving—making his dawn vow credible. Interiority sometimes drifts into packaged phrases (“tempered regret, cool and sharp…”) that blunt contradiction. The arc from complicit silencer to self-accusing truth-teller is legible, yet the beat of actually confessing is deferred off-page, so the cost is prospective rather than embodied now.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The brass-owl drawer pull gives Elias a tactile micro-choice in the first third and returns to charge the closing image; his interior contradiction—shame vs. resolve—is shown through grip, pocket-check, and final weight-shift rather than label-speak. The “quiet vow” is dramatized when he insists on moon-phase protocol, a beat that forecloses a faster political win. The only missed opportunity is Minister Kaela remaining a mirror rather than a second crucible; she never pressures his stance, so relationship dynamics stay flat. Still, the earned shift from relic-as-burden to relic-as-resolve lands with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arlo’s interiority runs concrete and particular—his “tight press of lips,” the brass weight “like a stone,” the utility-pole rosary—so we feel fracture without label-speak. The contradictory impulse (earthbound penance vs. star-love) stays active in-scene; the moment he wipes dew from the compass glass is a micro-choice that tilts the arc. Cost is felt: the vanished whistle, the tears that “mix with salt spray,” the final acceptance of the scar. A hairline slip: “competence shattered into regret” edges toward abstract summary; still, the arc earns its quiet realignment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—needing to feel while fearing the cost—are dramatized in embodied tremors and the micro-choice to release the baseball; the empathic turn is earned by cumulative memory flashes that carry visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s ache for Kael and her willingness to surrender her gift are felt in every beat; the paradoxically steady hands undercutting her tremor embodies contradiction without label-speak. The decision to become “vessel, bridge, and beacon” is foreshadowed by her lifetime of comforting creatures, so the final renunciation feels inevitable and costly. Interiority stays concrete—moon-pale petals, saffron dust on skin—never devolving into therapeutic self-explanation. The only hairline slip is “raw, persistent ache,” which edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but it’s instantly re-grounded in the hollow beneath her ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s grief-soaked need to recover “lost” birth-hours fuels every beat; the interiority stays concrete and embodied (“ink on her skin drink the starlight”). Yet the arc is interior surrender, not choice, so the final unfastening feels pre-ordained rather than paid for by a visible, forfeited alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority stays concrete—floating an inch then two under joy is an embodied contradiction that dramatizes her trait. The micro-choice to mend rather than fight is on-page and costly. Yet the text drifts into therapeutic self-summary (“she breathed into the discomfort”) at the very beat where raw irrationality should surface, muting the final increment of flaw-driven risk.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“texture of transformation”), but the only micro-choice on stage—uncorking jars—feels pre-decided; no live contradictory impulse pressures her in the release beat, so the renunciation is beautiful yet already resolved, limiting felt cost to texture rather than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s quietly mutinous interiority stays consistent and embodied (thumb on seam, fist crushing moss). The bronze quill holder becomes an extension of his calmly inventive trait, turning duty into clandestine agency. The only flaw: the “sprouting seed” cipher feels imported rather than grown from earlier image-work, slightly thinning the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to restore friction while fearing the cost of her curse—drives every beat; the barefoot-palm moment crystallizes her need for tactile connection. Micro-choices (boot clicks, rock placement, tear track) embody motive without label-speak. The earned renunciation—accepting sequence-by-sequence sacrifice—lands with visible cost (aurora dimming, lighter pouch). Only the mentor’s dying line feels slightly convenient, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and conflicted: the “furiously tranquil” spine-straight fold of hands against vibrating muscles externalizes the contradiction in one image. Micro-choices—pressing palm to cold glass, writing intimate verses—track her shift from vigil-as-pause to vigil-as-witness with visible cost (tears “mapping” new topography). The mentor letter is the only convenient knowledge gift, but it is foreshadowed by the cabinet search and her explicit goal, so the epiphany feels earned rather than parachuted. All traits (censored, scar-reader, high-altitude exile) converge in the final pen-stroke, making her arc inseparable from the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “diplomatically fierce” trait is dramatized once—welcoming the wind’s chaos as data—but otherwise told, not embodied. The mechanical arm is vivid texture; it never complicates or costs her anything. Interiority is lush yet generic; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Closure choice is foregone; the decoded invitation re-orients her mood without foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fear of the molt is embodied in the throat-tightening beat—and the seed-in-palm micro-choice visibly enacts the shift from Silas to root-voice. The monthly persona change is more label than lived contradiction until Kael’s speech; still, the final surrender carries credible cost under the Accumulative lens. Relationship as crucible works: Kael’s calm challenge directly alters her stance, foreclosing retreat. No head-count or status drift; anchor stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in micro-choices—threading the reel, clutching the clock—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into abstractions (“steely longing” twice). The final laugh and the 3:18 reset are earned, but the arbor transit feels frictionless; a stronger flaw-driven stumble would sharpen cost.

    Elara’s “empirically whimsical” paradox drives every micro-choice—she plants the seed with the same fingers that test cloud-whale buoyancy, embodying the tension. Interiority stays specific: luminous doubt “shimmering like the blossoms” externalizes emotion without cliché. The final stance—guardian of “the heart of reality itself”—is earned because her empirical mind records measurable proof while her whimsical heart risks absurd faith. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of detached verification and steps into permanent, participatory vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s placid discipline is embodied through tactile micro-choices—unfolding lace, steady bonsai snip—so his interior shift feels earned. The cerulean apology lands as a credible renunciation of guilt, not an epiphany. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, only remembered pain, so the “live” interior conflict beats stay thin. Still, the final stance carries visible cost: he keeps the regret as pigment, not wound.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aris’s internal contradiction—between clinical detachment and emergent emotional receptivity—is rendered through embodied choices (kneeling, returning with tools, leaving the leaf untouched) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His shift from preprocessing reality to surrendering to presence feels earned because each micro-choice (e.g., choosing sketches over calculations) carries visible cost: relinquishing control, embracing ambiguity. The final act of tarping—not repairing—shows a credible endurance that forecloses his old rigidity without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in her identity as a glass artist, and her resilience feels earned through embodied detail—scraped hands, bruised back, memory guided by frost. Her internal conflict between survival and purpose avoids tidy resolution, though the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“purpose crystallized”) without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene. The ledger’s transformation into art aligns with her core trait, yet the shift from terror to resolve occurs rapidly without friction between competing desires. Still, her micro-choice to preserve rather than destroy the ledger reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s trauma is rendered with embodied specificity—her silence isn’t absence but a language of gesture and vibration. Her motivation to translate silence into music is consistent, urgent, and expressed through micro-choices (e.g., striking the fork, pressing it to glass). Liam’s arrival activates her agency without overriding her arc; their shared catharsis emerges from her established method. The final renunciation of noise for resonance is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s inadvertently stubborn nature drives a pivotal, high-stakes choice—clutching the lens instead of logging it—and his interiority is rendered through tactile, embodied actions (e.g., fingers tightening, breath catching) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation (“to give rest a permanent address”) is dramatized via precise micro-choices that carry visible cost: reviving lost voices at the expense of archival neutrality. The final renunciation—accepting that brokenness can serve memory better than wholeness—feels earned by his consistent reverence for silenced stories. No emotional summarizing or stock phrasing dilutes his quiet, grief-laden resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in intergenerational repair, not just survival, and her choices—pairing elders with youth, handling the bell with ritual care—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“measured each breath,” “reverent hands”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final act of ringing the bell once is earned by prior causality: trust built through runs, stories, and shared burdens. Lena and Lin’s silent affirmation shows relationships as crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “pilgrim of sparks” and her spiritually curious nature, compelling her toward a specific metaphysical quest. Her internal conflict—between regret and compassion—is embodied through breath, gesture, and ritual rather than abstract introspection. The transformation from seeker to vessel of active compassion feels earned through micro-choices (breathing patterns, handling Kwan Yin’s tear) that align with her artistic practice. However, the absence of external pressure or relational friction limits the demonstration of contradictory impulses in dynamic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—discovering time’s texture through grief and mentorship—is embodied in tactile detail (fingers trailing hedges, clutching the halo fragment) and internal contradiction (longing for Aris vs. needing release). Her micro-choices (positioning the fragment, reciting incantations) reveal a hierarchy of values: reverence over control, surrender over force. The final transformation from sorrow to awe feels earned through forty years of buildup and twenty of study. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as physical sensation (“absence tighten around her heart like ivy”).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied, rooted in quiet devotion rather than exposition. Her internal conflict—between confinement and purpose—is rendered through micro-choices (decoding keys, pressing the arrow) that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the final renunciation lacks visible cost: her chains loosen symbolically without tangible sacrifice, weakening the “foreclosed path” requirement. The foreman’s awe arrives too easily, reducing moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—finding “the sound of trust breaking”—is deeply rooted in her synesthetic perception and trauma, compelling every action with psychological specificity. Her internal conflict between seeking fracture and needing wholeness manifests simultaneously in embodied choices (kneeling, pouring absences, focusing on the hollow). The final renunciation—designing aids that honor silence rather than erase it—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile, sensory detail tied to her profession and neurology.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her identity as a thief of fleeting beauty, and her internal conflict—between observer and participant—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., weaving lavender into the bouquet). The final renunciation of her old path feels earned, with visible cost: she abandons the train, symbolizing her former life. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“learning to read the light within herself”) without sufficient friction from prior misbeliefs, softening the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, resolve, and thawing are rendered through tactile detail (soot on cheek, thumb on bookmark crack) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (urge to abandon vs. ceremonial release) act simultaneously in scene, and her final renunciation of perfection is earned by prior causality. The micro-choice to discard the flawed vessel carries visible emotional cost, deepening her arc without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and trauma are embodied with visceral specificity, not summarized. Her micro-choices—kneeling despite fear, etching the shell—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Lily’s vulnerability catalyzes Elara’s agency without flattening her internal conflict. The final renunciation of hiding in favor of protective action is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her coastal past and obsession with silence, driving precise, embodied actions. Her internal contradiction—between witnessing endless night and seeking to map its emotional terrain—fuels credible micro-choices (e.g., selecting obsidian, timing work to the last star). However, her “mild obsession” remains more stated than dramatized through struggle or cost; it enables focus but lacks visible trade-offs that would elevate this to 9+. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit Seven’s motivation—seeking the origin of thought—is embodied through precise, iterative actions and culminates in a credible, earned realization. Its internal conflict between protocol and curiosity manifests in micro-choices (e.g., ignoring then approaching the violin), revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost: forty-three loops of disciplined repetition. The final renunciation of data-driven inquiry for experiential synthesis feels inevitable, not declarative, and avoids diagnostic label-speak even at peak insight. The “remarkably composed” trait enables patience as method, directly shaping the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her quiet fire for transparency manifests through precise micro-choices (e.g., projecting Kael’s symbols). Internal contradiction is subtle but present: she observes passively until recognizing complicity, then acts decisively. Kael’s arc is credible and compressed effectively; his silence shifts from barrier to shared peace without over-explanation. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness, revealing emotion through gesture (tear on dusty cheek) and action (palm over projected key).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is fiercely consistent, rooted in her tactile relationship with the garden and her rejection of quantified luck. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through hands, breath, marbles—and never veers into diagnostic abstraction. The confrontation with Kael crystallizes her values without melodrama, and her final endurance (“purpose bloomed with fierce clarity”) reads as earned stasis with visible cost: decades of marginalization. Every micro-choice (polishing, placing, speaking) reveals a hierarchy where care outweighs compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—reverence for time’s hidden grammar—is embodied in scarred hands, secret labor, and trembling awe, not abstract longing. His internal contradiction (obliging humility vs. quiet obsession) drives every micro-choice, from drone repairs to lever-pull. The final renunciation of “proof” for “listening” is earned through tactile, sensory engagement with the zephyrs and the device. Dr. Aris’s presence deepens his arc without overshadowing it, and their wordless communion feels inevitable, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in his identity as a musician and his obsession with the ghostly Maestro, compelling him to return nightly despite physical hardship. His internal conflict—between reverence for silence and the need to break it—is embodied in tactile choices (tracing stains, playing the cello) rather than abstract introspection. The final act of playing the phrase twice demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost: immersion in frigid water, emotional vulnerability, and acceptance of a sacred duty. His “lately inspired” state drives concrete action, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fever-addled perception, guilt-laden memory, and recalibrated fault-tolerance feel specific, contradictory, and physically grounded. Her micro-choice to lean into the smudge (not away) reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over perfection. The final whisper (“I trust the margin now”) earns its weight through prior causality—the swallowed warning, the whiteout storm—and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief manifests as tear, anchor, and altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Leo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his skepticism, exhaustion, and grief coalesce in tactile choices (e.g., gripping the beaded wheel). His motivation intensifies credibly from research to revelation, and the final turn reconfigures his understanding of his grandfather’s silence as courage, not cowardice. The emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, grounding epiphany in sensory detail (“frozen tears,” “grime on his cheek”). The micro-choice to turn the wheel crystallizes his inherited moral burden with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to witness transformation without judgment—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices like kneeling beside the sapling or tracing the swan’s folds. Her loose grip on reality enables her passage but exacts no visible cost, weakening the “flaw with consequence” expectation. Interiority is poetic yet specific, avoiding diagnostic labels, though her passivity borders on observational detachment rather than active endurance. The final inscription feels earned, yet lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off that would elevate it to Earned Stasis with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices—her adaptive strumming, the offering of the curl—but her interiority leans toward therapeutic abstraction (“ordinary magic,” “lifelong wonder”) without sufficient contradiction or struggle. Liam’s shift feels earned, yet his emotional arc lacks friction; his transformation hinges on a single celestial event rather than layered resistance. The baby hair curl functions as emotional shorthand but doesn’t force Elara into difficult trade-offs. Still, the final exchange—“I feel it”—carries quiet credibility because it emerges from shared silence, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The historian’s motivation is deeply rooted in his "sensitively perceptive" trait, which manifests not as a label but as embodied action—tracing paper with trembling reverence, feeling echoes in stone. His internal conflict between preservation and futility is rendered through micro-choices: sealing the case, inscribing Elara’s words, pressing his palm to the wall. The final endurance—continuing despite knowing his vigil will end—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation is rooted in regret and paternal longing, credibly intensified by his microdot ritual and strategic cookie placement. His internal conflict—between control and vulnerability—is embodied in the tension between “orchestrating” Elara’s return and the accidental efficacy of his open words. The final choice to speak plainly (“I am sorry”) is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. However, Elara’s interiority remains underdeveloped; her reaction hinges on a childhood memory but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices that would deepen the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between safety through reduction and the suffocation it causes—is embodied in her trembling, white-knuckled grip on the monochrome palette and culminates in her micro-choice to open it. Kael’s motivation is precise and consistent, his rhetorical probing acting as gentle scalpels rather than force. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their emotions are rendered through physicality and action (e.g., “a single tear traced dust,” “hand suddenly her own”). The final choice—to squeeze crimson onto wood—is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of confronting buried vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in embodied longing, not abstract nostalgia. Her micro-choices—pressing the shell to her temple, mapping memories with emotional precision—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The internal contradiction between fragility and purpose fuels her actions without tidy resolution. Exhaustion isn’t just fatigue; it’s a literal constraint that sharpens agency, making her final placement of the grandfather memory feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in sorrow and regret, and her internal conflict—between ambition and compassion, self-flagellation and forgiveness—is rendered with concrete, embodied stakes. The final choice to release the tablet feels earned by prior causality, especially the seventy-third traversal and the softened whisper. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“conquer the labyrinth of self”) rather than messy, contradictory irrationality under stress, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in embodied grief and a precise professional identity, with contradictions evident in her numbness versus yearning. Her micro-choices—offering the needle, placing palms on the drum—reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of silence as void is earned through tactile revelation, not epiphany. Kael’s presence applies pressure without overshadowing her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—nurturing integrity through meticulous observation—is consistently embodied in micro-choices (logging conditions, encoding truth in margins) and crystallizes under pressure without sentimentality. Her internal conflict between vigilance and vulnerability is rendered through concrete sensory detail (“frayed edges of her vigilance,” “panic was a luxury her methodology rejected”). The final renunciation of flight for lateral resistance feels earned by her established epistemology. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her wistfulness, caution, and grief manifest through tactile details (teak bench, crystal shadows) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (desire to understand vs. fear of emotional rupture) act simultaneously during the uncorking, and her final choice—to embrace remembrance—is earned by prior causality. The vial’s inscription crystallizes motivation without over-explaining, and her transformation from avoidance to acceptance carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s interiority is richly embodied—his “ethically playful” nature manifests in tangible micro-choices, not labels. His dilemma over the rope avoids tidy resolution, honoring moral ambiguity with visceral weight (“a single tear traced dust on his cheek”). The final renunciation feels earned through consistent traits and prior causality, with visible cost: sacrificing utility to preserve history. No diagnostic self-awareness or stock phrasing mars the emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking beauty in the unfinished—is embodied through micro-choices (inverting the bowl, positioning the violin) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her acoustically perceptive nature isn’t just stated but enacted, driving her awareness of hidden symphonies in silence. The memory of her grandfather emerges organically from sensory cues, not exposition, and tilts her present action. Her final renunciation—not restoring but amplifying a fragment—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s internal contradiction—between detached professionalism and yearning for authentic empathy—is rendered through embodied sensation (static electricity, tears on dust-streaked cheeks) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to subsume rather than discard the flawed batch emerges credibly from his established traits and past behavior. The transformation feels earned: his habitual detachment evaporates only after direct, physical contact with raw grief, not abstract realization. Final renunciation of counterfeit trade carries visible cost—abandoning his livelihood’s foundation—and reconfigures his identity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—his shrewd attention to detail and latent empathy—and intensifies credibly when he recognizes Elara’s invisibility. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through micro-choices: respecting privacy yet acting decisively, balancing broker pragmatism with emotional risk. Liam’s presence adds relational pressure that sharpens Elias’s stance without flattening either character. The only flaw: Elara’s characterization leans slightly on archetype, though her photo and son’s testimony ground her just enough.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in a desire for community—is consistent and embodied through her reed sculptures and final dedication. Her “boldly sympathetic” nature drives the pivotal offer to Kael, revealing hierarchy of values with cost: surrendering solitary artistry for shared meaning. Kael’s parallel arc deepens the crucible without overshadowing Elara’s POV. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her solitude vs. connection tension is stated more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in childhood longing and embodied through her illustrator’s precision, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped—her emotional arc leans toward epiphany without sufficient friction between desire and doubt. The pendant and time-sculpting trait reveal character under pressure, yet her choices feel predestined rather than wrestled from competing impulses. The mother’s lullaby provides poignant closure, but the cost of success (e.g., exhaustion, irreversible change) is implied rather than dramatized. Still, her micro-choices—like sculpting the bubble with moss-vein precision—show a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is embodied through precise, tactile choices (e.g., placing glass eyes in stone sockets) and contradicted by her quiet desperation, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her internal conflict between intellectual pursuit and emotional grief is rendered through sensory perception rather than exposition. The final renunciation—accepting Kael’s transformation as presence, not loss—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the end of her search, replaced by lived understanding. No head-hopping or safety-hedging; her flaws (obsession with pattern, aversion to ambiguity) directly shape her method and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in kindness, methodical preservation, and a desire to be seen by those who need her—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., placing the fragment at 6:18 AM). Her internal conflict between solitude and connection manifests physically (bare feet on textured walls, concealed retreat) without therapy-speak. The final step into dawn light is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. Evans’ reciprocal recognition validates Elara’s agency without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—between control and surrender—is rendered with embodied specificity: her tightened hands versus circuitous speech, her frantic staking rituals versus the tear tracing soil. The micro-choice to return the leaf, not repair, crystallizes her shift credibly. Her flaw (control as love) directly generates prior damage and the eventual cost: relinquishing the illusion of order. No diagnostic label-speak mars the epiphany; insight emerges through tactile interaction with the linden leaf and moss.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s insomnia, grief, and devotion are rendered through embodied contradiction—his relentless painting versus his exhaustion, his solitude versus his yearning for connection. The amber brooch anchors his motivation without over-explanation, and his final choice to relinquish it feels earned by seventeen years of silent vigil. Elara’s presence tests his belief in legacy, not just memory, forcing a renunciation that carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete, specific, and flaw-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in compassion for her community, and her internal conflict—between reliance on foresight and the necessity of faith—is embodied in her surrender to the present moment. Her micro-choice to close her eyes and focus purely on intention, abandoning prediction, is a credible, high-stakes pivot that forecloses her old mode of being. The pilgrim, though minimally characterized, applies immediate pressure through his very presence as the “void” in her visions. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the shift from anxiety to joy lacks the grit of lingering doubt or bodily fatigue that would ground such transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “reactively visionary” gift manifests through tactile, emotionally charged contact with the valve, not exposition. Her micro-choices (cleansing the valve, selecting staggered intervals) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over completeness, healing over spectacle. The final renunciation isn’t of exile but of silence, earned through prior causality and bearing visible cost in the community’s raw reactions. No diagnostic label-speak; even “emotional geography” feels character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her analytically artistic lens, and her emotional armor feels earned by fifteen years of quiet desperation. The final choice—surrendering her map—is compellingly motivated by her lifelong pattern-seeking and desire for truth. However, the internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; her fear and certainty alternate rather than coexist in the climactic moment. The tear at the end reads as release, not struggle, softening the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism and compassion pull against each other in real time, especially when she chooses to act on the tile despite doubt.

Final renunciation of pure rationality feels earned through sensory immersion, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—“to discover what happens after goodbye”—is deeply embodied, consistent, and drives every pivotal choice. His immortality and dimensional awareness are not labels but lived constraints that shape his perception and action. The final renunciation of solitude for purpose is earned through the amulet’s activation and the spatial mutiny, with visible emotional cost (tears, transformed sanctuary). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory and spatial metaphors (“boredom polished to a flawless, suffocating sheen”) that feel character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—honesty as both vulnerability and strength—is rendered with embodied specificity, especially in her tactile engagement with the ink pot and embalming tools. Her motivation (“mathematics of a fair trade”) evolves credibly through micro-choices: writing, waiting, redacting names. The final renunciation of her father’s legacy is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she honors his complexity without inheriting his deceptions. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels lived-in, not schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her studious nature and devotion to preserving texture, not nostalgia—a distinction that fuels her precise, emotionally restrained actions. Her internal conflict between erasure and attention manifests in micro-choices: selecting charcoal, filtering sound, charting hums. The invented histories reveal a compassionate rebellion against oblivion, with clear cost in isolation and labor. Final renunciation—no customers, only continuity—feels earned through consistent, embodied ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—hunger for sensory memory texture—is embodied with striking specificity (grit of gravel, cadence of whispers) and drives every action. His internal contradiction (erased self seeking to anchor others’ memories) manifests in micro-choices like reverently smoothing the poison label. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception. Final renunciation of personal identity to serve as witness feels earned, with visible cost in his aching bones and hollow core.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her myth-busting precision contrasts with her emotional vulnerability, creating authentic contradiction. Her micro-choices (e.g., emphasizing “remember” while playing the cello) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief and love. The reimagined dialogue feels earned, not diagnostic, and her final renunciation of permanence in truth carries visible cost. Flawless integration of professional identity and personal wound elevates motivation beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s dual allegiance and orderly-intuitive nature are embodied in micro-choices—like placing symbols with geometric precision while trusting intuitive flourishes—that reveal his internal contradiction without abstraction. His motivation is dramatized through action, not declaration, and his final stance crystallizes from consistent traits. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak; his “hopeful desperation” is felt in bodily detail (stone chip against chest, weary smile). However, secondary characters like Elara function more as symbolic extensions than fully pressurized agents, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal and generational legacy, embodied through tactile actions (handling the sand grain, enduring cold) rather than abstract sentiment. His internal conflict—between scientific duty and emotional witness—is rendered without therapy-speak, and his final endurance (Earned Stasis) carries visible cost: grief, solitude, and irreversible loss. The grandfather’s hourglass functions as a lived memory, not a prop, and Kael’s micro-choices (e.g., sealing the grain over his heart) reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is weathered into bone and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her blindness isn’t a trait but a sensory reorientation that shapes every micro-choice. Her motivation (“sacred duty,” not pressure) emerges from consistent, character-specific values, and her calm under deadline feels earned, not idealized. The repair act crystallizes her worldview without epiphany or therapy-speak. Her flaw—absolute reliance on water-refracted light—is both enabling and constraining, with visible cost in the urgency of the ship’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s dry wit, professional history, and quiet rebellion cohere into a vividly specific interiority. Her motivation—seeking origins over symptoms—is dramatized through micro-choices (deciphering condensation, consulting the phrasebook) that reveal her worldview under pressure. The final decision to drill emerges organically from her accumulated knowledge and stance, with cost felt in the solitude of her conviction. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in frost-feather observation and stove-tending.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s infinite patience is not merely stated but embodied in every micro-choice—her deliberate cadence, resistance to haste, and tactile engagement with the tuning fork and stones reveal a character whose trait directly constrains action under pressure. Her motivation is rooted in consistent, sensory-driven interiority (“listening to the spaces between heartbeats”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of sound—her footsteps becoming silent—earns a resonant stasis with visible cost: her personal rhythm absorbed into the town’s, erasing her audible presence. No internal contradiction weakens her arc; instead, her flaw (patience bordering on self-erasure) becomes the instrument of salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s motivation—redemption through preserving memory—is consistently embodied in his micro-choices: resisting panic, invoking Elena’s memory, and prioritizing reverence over survival.

The final renunciation of life for legacy feels earned, with visible cost (death) and emotional specificity (tears invisible in seawater). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile and context-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—threading truth into a legacy of disbelief—is rooted in specific, embodied history and drives every micro-choice. His restraint (“not force, but focus”) contrasts with his father’s myth, making his quiet persistence credible. Elias’s arc from skepticism to absolution is earned through the lattice revelation, not sentiment. The only flaw: slight emotional tidiness in Elias’s tear-and-belief pivot, though mitigated by the grime-and-copper visual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ghost bride’s motivation is vividly rooted in a past betrayal and a vow across lifetimes, driving her spectral actions with emotional specificity. Her internal conflict—mournful elation, love as both poison and cure—is embodied in tactile gestures like the “lovingly venomous” touch on the shadow-rose. However, her interiority occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction (“ripple of sorrow and resolve”) rather than concrete, character-particular cognition under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, but a tighter link between her flaw (trusting love blindly) and her sacrifice would have elevated it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a wharf weaver and poetic dreamer, with interiority rendered through embodied ritual rather than exposition. Her grief and hope coexist without tidy resolution, especially in the central chamber where tears “trace clean paths through dust.” However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—her resolve remains unchallenged by doubt or hesitation, flattening emotional complexity at key moments like the final stitch.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in diasporic rupture and ancestral silence, rendered through embodied actions—kneeling, brushing soil, aligning wood—not abstract longing. Her internal conflict between doubt and devotion manifests in micro-choices (e.g., selecting a sapling branch over imported materials) that reveal hierarchy of values. The final act of rebuilding the gnomon emerges organically from her curiosity and reverence, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“tear traced warmth through the dust”) and contradictory (grief intertwined with hope).

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply internalized, with micro-choices (rejecting “Lyra” and “Corbin,” adopting “Aurora”) revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in emotional authenticity. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied—tears pricking, kneeling to read chalk, the weight of the clipboard. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves cleanly from dilemma to resolution without palpable struggle, slightly undercutting the “carefully inventive” trait’s tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “placid smile” masking sharp intelligence, her needlework as rebellion—and her motivation (“to listen for unheard stories”) fuels credible, high-stakes choices. Her disguise of wisdom as foolishness enables tactical invisibility with clear cost: isolation and condescension. The final delivery to Captain Idris arises organically from established trust and shared cultural literacy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through precise physical control (“hands remained steady”) under dread.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s regret is embodied through tactile details—the softened letter, mud-sucking boots—and his internal conflict between pride and longing feels authentic. His micro-choices (clutching the letter, bracing against Elara’s insight) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward unearned clarity: the vision of Lena’s forgiveness arrives via external magic rather than emerging from Kael’s own re-examination, softening the causality of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Anahera’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and culturally specific detail, avoiding therapy-speak while revealing contradictory impulses—her hardened experience versus tender hope. Her motivation to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is dramatized through micro-choices (decoding the cast, placing the coral) that carry emotional cost. The memory of the refugee boy isn’t mere exposition; it’s a visceral trigger that shapes her present action. However, Leo’s role remains largely passive, limiting reciprocal pressure in their relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in embodied longing, not abstract nostalgia—her micro-choices (pressing the fragment into the wall, surrendering to the daydream) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; her “pensive mirth” emerges from sensory immersion, not exposition. The final renunciation—leaving the fragment as a seed—is earned by prior causality and forecloses personal possession for communal legacy. No secondary characters dilute focus, preserving single-POV intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with plaster and pigment, her shift from scholarly certainty to curiosity, and the nested awakenings feel earned through specific sensory experience. The final renunciation of mastery for wonder carries clear emotional cost. Her motivation evolves credibly under pressure, and her micro-choices (e.g., returning the nickel angled for dawn) reveal a reconfigured hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphanies arise from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s motivation is vividly rooted in personal trauma from the cognitive audit, and his defiance manifests through embodied choices—planting seeds, adjusting ferns, closing his eyes to feel the buried gourd. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through action (scholar vs. rogue, tenderness vs. resolve). Petrova’s minimal but precise presence sharpens their dynamic without diluting focus. The final spark-to-beacon shift feels earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is richly embodied—his insomnia, longing, and creative resolve manifest through tactile actions (tracing the postcard, pressing it to the wall) and sensory perception. His “shyly unstoppable” nature drives micro-choices that accumulate toward transformation. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; his pain and resolve alternate rather than coexist under pressure. The epiphany feels earned but leans slightly on lyrical abstraction over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a specific, embodied devotion—to preserve forgotten names—and her micro-choices (adjusting the lens, humming the lullaby, tracing the crack) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions like “foxglove regret” are woven into action and perception, not summarized. The final tear and whispered gratitude crystallize her endurance as Earned Stasis, foreclosing silence through daily ritual. Contradictory impulses—beauty and sorrow, preservation and loss—act simultaneously without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“tears of relief traced warm paths”) and micro-choices under pressure (tracing glyphs despite soul-deep tremor). Her motivation—restoring trust—is consistent, flawed, and intensified by the 97-day silence. The final admission to Kael (“I was wrong to let doubt replace dialogue”) feels earned, not epiphanic. However, Kael’s shift leans slightly toward convenient receptivity without deeper resistance, softening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in his dual inheritance—professional (floodgate machinist) and familial (grandfather’s chain)—and his internal conflict between reverence and utility manifests in embodied choices, not abstract declarations. His trembling hands evolve from doubt to connection, a physical arc that mirrors the thematic resolution. The final renunciation—leaving the chain as a bridge—forecloses personal ownership with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and precise action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve the echo of lost songs—is embodied in micro-choices (placing the meteorite on the ledger, writing the truth) and contradicted by his reinvention, creating authentic tension. His internal conflict between concealment and testimony is rendered through specific, sensory-rich perception rather than diagnostic labels. The final act of trust—writing honestly and planning to share with Clara—feels earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. His flaw (self-erasure to avoid grief) directly complicates his arc and is confronted without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the bench and logbook, revealing interiority without diagnostic label-speak. Her “featherly determined” resolve manifests in micro-choices—tracing grain, opening the logbook—that align with her quest. The story avoids tidy emotional resolution, instead showing acceptance layered over grief. However, internal contradiction is muted; her resolve never visibly fractures under pressure, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—learning the rhythm of belonging—is dramatized through embodied choices: tracing constellations with a burnt feather, ascending flooded corridors, releasing the feather at dawn. Her internal contradiction (solitude vs. connection) manifests in simultaneous gestures: clutching loss while seeking light. The final renunciation—releasing the feather—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices—kneeling, planting seeds, testing the glass—that reveal her contradictory impulses: hope shadowed by sorrow, urgency tempered by reverence. Her emotional arc feels earned, culminating in a renunciation of control that forecloses her initial fear of loss with visible cost (tears, breath held, evaporating sea-foam work). No diagnostic label-speak; feelings emerge through action and object interaction. The final smile amid tears crystallizes her “cheerful gloom” as credible endurance, not tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Corbin’s motivation—quiet rebellion through orchestrated serendipity—is rooted in consistent, specific traits and intensifies meaningfully when he places the bishop. His internal conflict (analytical control vs. openness to organic connection) acts simultaneously in scene, especially during the man’s arrival. Emotions are embodied: “lightly attentive focus,” “warmth spreading through his chest.” The elderly man’s transformation feels earned, not sentimental, and Corbin’s final nod conveys deep restraint without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her tide-dancer’s intuition, exile-born resolve—and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., using dewdrop and starlight) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Kael’s storm-eyed presence creates a crucible that forces Elara to act, not merely endure. Their interaction avoids sentimentality; trust is fragile, earned, and costly. The final renunciation of exile feels inevitable because it emerges from prior causality, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through her perception of light, glass, and water, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices—kneeling, tossing the stone, interpreting rings—are consistent with her reflective vocation and deepen her commitment to finding sacredness in transience. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from contemplation to certainty without friction or struggle, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a tangible cost (e.g., physical limitation, social consequence) weakens the credibility of her “rebellion.”

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—scars, porcelain box, and firefighter past converge into a coherent emotional logic. His motivation to “translate pain” avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in tactile ritual (tracing fractures) and concrete memory (the child’s drawing). However, the absence of contradictory impulses or active struggle flattens agency; his epiphany feels received rather than wrestled from conflict. The final choice—to carry the box as a lantern—is earned but lacks a visible renunciation or cost beyond abstract transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her “logical dreamer” paradox and micro-choices like arranging the shell spiral or noting the gauge reading. Her motivation—crafting equations for hope—is consistent and embodied in ritual, not abstract. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she never wavers or resists her mission, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a tangible cost to her own psyche (beyond implied fatigue) slightly undermines the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deepens credibly, anchored in her “sensitively perceptive nature” and obsession with walls’ dreams. Her micro-choices—kneeling, brushing ash, handling fragments—embody her interiority without therapy-speak. The final covenant feels earned, though the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior friction between her curiosity and the burden of joy. No secondary characters dilute focus, but the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mirage painter’s motivation is vividly rooted in a poetic desire to restore hope, and his internal conflict—balancing borrowed life against urgent purpose—is embodied through the faltering heartbeat. His calmness under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values: transformation over self-preservation. However, his interiority leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction rather than concrete contradiction, and the child donor remains a distant symbol, not a fully integrated relational counterweight. The final renunciation is earned, but the emotional cost lacks granular physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—redemption through self-erasure—is deeply rooted in his past atrocity and consistently shapes his present choices. His internal conflict (desire for peace vs. burden of guilt) manifests in embodied restraint: “operatively gentle” isn’t a label but a practiced discipline under pressure. The confession scene (“I burned the Vale”) is raw, costly, and catalyzes closure without epiphanic neatness. His final renunciation reads as earned endurance, not escape, with visible emotional tremor beneath steady hands.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—amoral empire-builder versus secret sentimentalist—operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. His micro-choices (e.g., aligning the egg with the northern crack, refusing to bury it) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The tear on his cheek and trembling hands embody emotion without therapy-speak. His final renunciation—leaving the egg exposed—is earned by prior causality and carries the weight of extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her chastity as dedication, not denial—and her internal conflict (defying the lullaby of conformity while enduring mental and physical strain) is embodied in precise, poetic action. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory detail (“sweat traced paths through frost”) and micro-choices (untangling specific threads). However, her interiority occasionally leans into abstraction (“bodily poetic certainty”) without sufficient grounding in concrete contradiction, slightly weakening the 9+ threshold. The final renunciation is earned, with visible cost: exhaustion, risk, and emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—his serenity masking ego, his subversion masking control. His final choice to transcribe rather than perform is earned through the accusatory echo of Lena’s words and tactile interaction with the story stick. However, the absence of Lena on the page limits relational crucible depth, and his epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“ethics resided not in reversing a story’s moral, but in reversing the storyteller’s role”) without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation as an esoteric realist is embodied in precise micro-choices—tying knots with reverence, pressing the moth wing into her structure—that reveal a hierarchy of values honoring overlooked histories. Her internal contradiction (celebrating impermanence while seeking preservation) manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic self-awareness. The compassionate knot at the climax earns her transformation through prior causality, with visible cost: she sacrifices her signal’s integrity to mend the monarch. No safety-hedging; her flaws (rigid ritualism) directly complicate her final act of care.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—forgiveness transmuted into preservation—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: her lost-wax philosophy, technically gentle hands, and reverence for fragile memory. Her internal conflict (regret vs. peace) acts simultaneously during the braid-weaving, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—renouncing silence by reconfiguring the rope—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost: tears, dissolved sorrow, and a sacred trust. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“snowmelt ardor,” “frost on her cheeks”).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—craving clarity yet trapped between foresight and hindsight—are embodied in tactile detail (e.g., tracing cold stone, feeling raindrops) and resolved through earned transcendence. Her motivation is consistent, deeply personal, and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to step into the storm feels inevitable yet costly, with the decay of the directive serving as both catalyst and sacrifice. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from sensory immersion, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Enlil’s motivation is clear and consistent—his frugal rigor as encrypted devotion—but his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; skepticism and faith unfold sequentially rather than in active conflict. His micro-choices (measuring oil, aligning the tile) reveal values credibly, yet emotional embodiment remains abstract (“warmth… recognition”) rather than viscerally grounded. The final renunciation (extinguishing the lamp) is earned, but the cost feels conceptual rather than tangible. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, and interiority avoids diagnostic labels, though epiphany edges close to unearned clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifism” and Kael’s resentment are vividly embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., accepting the box, recalling the winding) revealing internal conflict. The cellular memory device risks therapy-speak but is grounded in tactile recall—ivory key, lavender soap—that avoids abstraction. However, Elara’s interiority remains underdeveloped; her strategy feels omniscient rather than humanly flawed. The final release is earned, though the speed of transformation slightly compresses the bitterness established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in her craft and grief, with micro-choices—coaxing shards, synchronized breathing—that reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over control, harmony over capture. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile ritual (“whispering apologies to the broken glass”). The final renunciation—welcoming rather than seizing the dream—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of surrendering mastery. Her “firmly grounded” trait actively enables her method and forecloses forceful solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied conflict—her daughter’s rejection of tradition—and her actions (using the ribbon, spider-silk, resin) reveal layered values under pressure. The internal contradiction between honoring roots and enabling growth manifests physically in her repair method. Lyra’s late arrival doesn’t feel contrived because her presence is foreshadowed by the ribbon and letter, and their reconciliation emerges from Elara’s changed understanding, not sentimentality. The “feisty” trait recurs meaningfully, shaping both characters’ voices and choices without becoming a label.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, distorted reflection, and frozen tears ground her emotional arc in sensory specificity. Her motivation (forbidden knowledge) intensifies credibly into a renunciation of extraction for receptivity, with clear micro-choices (bathroom ritual, silent intent) revealing her hierarchy of values. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead from fractured water reflections and tactile experience. Her bewilderment-to-stewardship shift feels earned by prior struggle and carries the solemn cost of sacred trust.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves with credible interiority—her fear voiced to sprout the vine feels earned, not diagnostic. Her “carefully resourceful” trait manifests in micro-choices (interpreting diary gaps as cartography) that align with her profession and deepen under pressure. Kael’s presence serves as crucible without flattening Elara’s agency; their dynamic sharpens the thematic stakes. The final reconfiguration—tending gardens instead of seeking a library—carries visible cost: she remains while he departs, solidifying her new purpose through renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief manifests in tactile rituals (wildflowers on Ferris wheel seats, whispering to mannequins) and contradictions (clutching memories until they “draw blood” yet seeking peace). Her final renunciation—releasing the emerald card—is earned through escalating distortions of memory that make retrieval impossible. The chimera twin premise grounds her fracture without over-explanation. Micro-choices (e.g., opening her hand at the stern) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “warmly methodical” nature shapes every micro-choice, from tracing gear housings to weaving the seal into the rope. Her motivation (“translate confusion into clarity”) is embodied, not declared, and intensifies under pressure without becoming tidy or diagnostic. The final act of integration carries visible cost: the halt of time, the vanished door, the altered rope—all earned by her prior commitment to honoring absence. No emotional summarizing; feelings emerge through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is visceral and consistent, rooted in his identity as keeper of sonic topographies. His internal conflict—between grief and duty transformed into imperative—is embodied through precise sensory reactions (e.g., marrow-vibrating roars, frayed nerves). The final choice to listen rather than project aligns with his character arc and carries visible cost: three days of tension released in a single tear. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her retrocognitive gift and thistle-blown hope, compelling her toward a high-stakes act of faith. Her internal conflict—between memory and forward-looking purpose—is rendered through embodied choices (pressing the shard to her forehead, aligning the prism) rather than abstract reflection. The vision of Master Aris crystallizes her resolve without over-explaining, and her final smile carries the weight of earned certainty. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: her preemptive nostalgia, tactile embodiment of emotion (“tears traced warm paths”), and micro-choices (dipping the quill, writing specific details) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her motivation—to sculpt identity from experience—is dramatized through action, not declaration. The internal conflict between archival duty and longing for connection pulses beneath every observation, culminating in a credible, earned resolve. No diagnostic label-speak; even peak epiphanies are grounded in sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her craft and moral stance against despair, and her interiority—embodied through sensory perception and ritualized action—feels authentic and specific. The contradiction between her hope and the world’s hopelessness simmers beneath every gesture, especially in how she handles Kael’s knot. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible struggle or misstep; her resolve feels untested rather than earned through error or doubt, slightly undercutting the “flawed but credible” threshold for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s warmly observant nature and tidal-pool chronicler identity are embodied through precise micro-choices—her gaze shifts, thumb tracing the jade cicada, anchoring speech in shared memory—that reveal her hierarchy of values: patience over confrontation, observation over assertion. Kael’s silence and tear are rendered with equal specificity, avoiding diagnostic labels; his whispered admission feels earned, not performative. Their relationship functions as a crucible where mutual history and biological metaphors (crab, cicada) constrain and catalyze change. The final renunciation of blame carries visible emotional cost, fulfilling Earned Stasis without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and rebellion are embodied with visceral specificity—the phantom pressure on her ribs, the porcelain doll as compass—not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (closing eyes, releasing the doll) reveal a hierarchy of values: freedom over inherited fear. The transformation from confinement to release feels earned through sensory immersion rather than epiphany. Interior contradiction thrums in her simultaneous dread and yearning, rendered without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role and worldview, and she actively shapes Leo’s emotional arc through micro-choices (e.g., lifting the vial, guiding attention). Leo’s grief is embodied—rigid posture, flinching—and evolves credibly into weary peace. However, his internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; we see only sorrow, not competing impulses. The final smile feels earned, but the transformation leans slightly on Elara’s orchestration rather than Leo’s autonomous struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in reverence and restoration, not power, and her internal conflict—between urgency and meticulous care—is embodied in her peeling technique under time pressure. Her “wisely adventurous” spirit manifests in micro-choices: kneeling reverently, selecting paint layers with historical awareness, and ultimately renouncing the throne. The final renunciation feels earned, not epiphanic, because it emerges from tactile engagement with layered history. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in sweat, trembling hands, and dissolving ruby motes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath, scars, and tactile rituals reveal a psyche shaped by precise self-preservation. Her motivation (“to teach suffocating things how to breathe”) emerges not as declaration but as urgent, empathetic action rooted in lived trauma. The final renunciation—not opening the door—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: sanctuary remains intact, but isolation is transformed into pedagogy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity thrives in contradiction (precision vs. compassion, solitude vs. connection).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—translating pressure into meaning—is embodied through her tactile relationship with the bolt and her micro-choice to volunteer, then plant the diamond. Her virtuously mischievous trait manifests in concrete action (spore constellations, burying the diamond), not label-speak. Internal conflict simmers beneath calm: fear vs. courage, ruin vs. alchemy. The final renunciation of victimhood is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in generational legacy and personal silence, rendered through embodied stillness and micro-choices (e.g., not disturbing the dust).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in her tactile reverence for overlooked kindnesses. Her motivation—rooted in post-emancipation grief—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices like logging Samuel’s file with care.

No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in gesture and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: her quiet vow against historical erasure drives every action. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through embodied choices—e.g., kneeling to study a hoofprint while enforcers close in. The final renunciation (standing firm rather than fleeing) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Her underestimated status isn’t told but shown through tactile details like the satchel seam and tarnished key.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—rooted in mercy, memory, and duty—but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotions are embodied (tears, breath, muscle memory), yet the absence of struggle or doubt flattens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as memory’s custodian, and her micro-choices—catching the leaf, building the monument—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on remembrance. Interiority is concrete (“mossy delight,” “breath hitched”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her transformation lacks internal contradiction; she moves seamlessly from duty to epiphany without friction or struggle, softening the cost of her endurance. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

Her micro-choices (shifting melody to include whimsy, invoking specific memories) stem from consistent traits and directly alter Cora’s trajectory. The spectral confession scene avoids therapy-speak; emotion arises through luminous tremors and fractured threads, not labels.

His proprioceptive enhancements and trauma responses shape credible, high-stakes decisions without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—repurposing the mask strap as a compass—earns closure with visible emotional cost. Only slight over-articulation in “Mercy = Σ (small kindnesses) / (opportunity for cruelty)” risks therapy-speak but is redeemed by immediate sensory grounding.

His interiority is embodied through tactile observation (“reading dust as a historical document”) rather than abstract reflection. The ghost interaction reveals compassionate stillness as a value hierarchy under pressure. However, Elias’s backstory arrives via empathic summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, slightly flattening the emotional cost of Leo’s vow.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is vividly embodied and drives every action, yet her internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses during peak pressure. Her competence borders on effortless, slightly muting struggle, though her micro-choices (e.g., aligning cloud-parchment via frost patterns) reveal hierarchy of values. The cost—strain in her bones, destabilizing the library—is felt but not deeply personalized beyond physical toll. Still, her arc credibly earns the Earned Stasis of transformation through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in loyalty to Kaelen and a sacred duty to restore truth, not academic victory. Her internal conflict—between grief and resolve—is embodied in precise actions (covering mirrors, projecting the shard’s truth) and culminates in a renunciation of personal vindication for communal clarity. The final choice carries visible cost: Kaelen’s dream is redeemed only after his death, and Elara bears that sorrow as polished ache. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“tears traced warm paths,” “cool crystal”) and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in his physical and spiritual sensitivity to dishonesty—is vividly embodied and consistent. His internal conflict (enduring collapse to sustain truth) manifests through concrete, contradictory impulses: wilting yet turning the key, weeping yet singing. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of force; he accepts balance, not victory. His flaw directly enables the resolution, with visible cost in bodily strain and emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, specific traits—her “sensibly eccentric” devotion to ephemeral scents—and her internal conflict (seeking explanation vs. surrendering to awe) manifests through embodied choices, not abstract epiphanies. The psychometry beat risks diagnostic phrasing (“hinged awakening”), but Thorne’s imprint feels earned through sensory flood rather than exposition. Her final renunciation—leaving the compass—carries visible cost and crystallizes her arc without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a driftwood sculptor and her ancestral bond with Anya, compelling her to reject GPS failure as crisis and instead embrace “timewoven alliances.” Her internal conflict—between technological reliance and ancestral wisdom—is embodied in tactile choices (carving without sketch, using the lantern slide) rather than abstract reflection. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphanic clarity (“tears... not sorrow, but connection”) without sufficient contradictory friction under pressure; the transformation feels earned but borders on seamless, lacking the grit of genuine struggle. Still, her micro-choices (e.g., closing eyes to let turbine hum guide her) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: surrendering control to memory.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in intergenerational legacy and embodied through precise, tactile choices—mixing pigments, pressing palms to glass—that reveal her interiority without diagnostic labels. Her quiet drive manifests as patient action, not passive observation, and the final shift from confusion to understanding feels earned through sustained attention. The emotional arc avoids tidy resolution, instead crystallizing into “umbral tenderness”—a complex fusion of grief, gratitude, and connection. No internal contradiction is forced, yet her vulnerability before the glass reads as both artistic and human.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in archival integrity and moral urgency, and his internal conflict—between scholarly detachment and visceral intervention—is rendered through embodied tension (ink-stained hands, trembling focus). His micro-choice to rearrange the stones reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over neutrality, action over observation. The retrocognitive limitation enforces credible struggle, and his flaws (obsession, emotional vulnerability) complicate rather than obstruct his arc. However, Anya’s presence remains spectral; her agency is reactive, not reciprocal, slightly weakening the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her rejection of magical nostalgia and commitment to human-scale renewal, consistently embodied through micro-choices: rejecting false comfort, anchoring breath in the bottle, sketching the greenhouse. Her internal conflict—between memory and reimagination—is rendered without therapy-speak, and her competence as an alchemist-turned-architect feels earned, not imposed. The final act of planting the bottle demonstrates a renunciation with visible cost: she abandons resurrection for slow, generational work. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile specificity (e.g., “hemp paper,” “driftwood brush”).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her archival vocation and evolves credibly into cultivation; her interiority is specific, embodied through ink-stained fingers and heartbeat-synced resonance. The shift from passive archivist to active cultivator is earned by the revelation of the accidental prophecy. However, the internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—her decades of work pivot without visible struggle or doubt, slightly softening the cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent, with micro-choices (e.g., arranging seeds with “reverent sweeps”) revealing her values under pressure. Her internal state—“furiously tranquil focus”—is shown through action, not label-speak, and her epiphany about borrowed time arises from tactile experience, not abstraction. The tear that freezes on her cheek crystallizes emotional cost without sentimentality. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or struggle slightly limits depth; her path is unwavering, reducing tension in decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in decades of observation and a rejection of fear-based ritual—is embodied in micro-choices (testing frost angles, tasting the air) and crystallizes in her refusal to ring the bell. Her internal conflict between duty and discernment is rendered through concrete sensory detail rather than abstraction. The final renunciation carries visible cost: risking institutional censure for truth. Abbot Theron’s quiet validation confirms the stakes were real, not theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s motivation is consistent and rooted in his spiritually curious nature, driving his ritual of tracing stars to seek strength in vulnerability. His internal conflict—between solitude and communion—is rendered through embodied emotion (tears, breath held, dust on cheek) rather than abstract labels. The final choice to embrace vulnerability as sacred feels earned, though the lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (rather than sequentially summarized) prevents a 9+. No secondary characters dilute focus, but the absence of a tangible trade-off or foreclosed path beyond internal realization slightly limits cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recluse’s motivation—preserving unspoken emotional weight—is consistent, embodied through ritualized action (opening the box at dawn), and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses isolation as mere solitude. His internal contradiction (astonishment vs. duty) manifests simultaneously in perception and stillness, not alternating summaries. The final renunciation isn’t of the covenant but of its burden-as-chain, refigured as bridge—a shift earned by accumulated contextual reading. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in posture, gaze, and dust patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand time’s texture—is vividly embodied through sensory memory and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the glyph, penning the card). His internal conflict between borrowed-time urgency and compassionate legacy feels authentic, though his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory resistance. The urn fragment anchors his transformation credibly, and his final act of message-embedding reflects a hierarchy of values with visible cost: his dissolution. Elara’s brief presence doesn’t dilute Kael’s interiority, but her instant comprehension borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—beauty in the incomplete—is vividly embodied through her perception and micro-choices, especially in how she reinterprets the kite’s fall. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile attention (e.g., reverence for “unplanned grace”). The final act of writing with the feather quill crystallizes her enduring stance, not a tidy change, with visible cost: she leaves the kite for the tide, accepting loss as part of the weave. However, her flaw remains abstract; no genuine struggle or misstep complicates her wisdom, slightly softening the edge of earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in quiet purpose rather than dread—is embodied through precise, ritualized actions that reveal his values under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion emerges via tactile detail (e.g., “fingers gnarled but steady,” “warmth blooming under his palm”). The final renunciation—accepting death while deepening life—is earned by consistent micro-choices that foreclose haste in favor of presence, with visible cost in his slowing breath and shallow respiration.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s academically rebellious skepticism is embodied through micro-choices (rejecting the main gate, following footprints) and interior contradictions (scientific rigor vs. yearning for belonging). Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding transformation in tactile encounters with amber and resin. The convergence with Elias feels earned, not sentimental, as their ideological war dissolves through shared awe rooted in prior stakes. However, Elias’s sudden presence lacks sufficient buildup of his internal shift, slightly softening the reciprocity of their transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in a personal, generational vow, and his interiority—conveyed through tactile memory, linguistic sensitivity, and quiet grief—is both specific and embodied. His micro-choices (kneeling, crushing pods, watering) align precisely with his worldview and carry visible emotional cost. The contradiction between honoring scars and transforming them pulses through every action without veering into sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness. His final smile earns its warmth through the weight of everything unsaid and undone.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—translating Elara’s absence into closeness—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (his intuitively descriptive nature, tactile memory of the leaf) and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (retirement vow vs. love’s pull) manifests simultaneously in refusal and fixation, not alternating summaries. The final choice—to walk east—is earned by prior causality: his perceptual gift, Elara’s remembered advice, and the cylinder’s riddle converge without epiphanic leap. Cost is visible: he abandons hard-won stasis, reactivating old wounds as fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from grief to active inquiry, grounded in specific ancestral practices and sensory detail. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile actions—sketching as both ritual and investigation. The final choice to navigate rather than wait is earned by prior causality (the Lyre glimpse, the compass rose, the grandfather’s whisper). Cost is felt in her solitude redefined as partnership, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in “sacredly playful reverence”—is vividly embodied in his joyful focus during high-stakes restoration, not grim duty. His internal contradiction (thief who gives back) manifests in micro-choices: swapping pawns radiating greed for ones symbolizing growth, enduring cold despair to enact harmony. Emotion is physical (“tears froze on Kael’s cheeks”) and tied to action, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of theft as “giving back what was lost” feels earned through consistent causality and visible cost—his bone-deep exposure to corrupted energies.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her transformation from crisis actor to survivor-historian, and her “benevolently ruthless” trait manifests through embodied choices—gently extracting painful truths without exploitation. Her internal contradiction (preserving memory vs. enduring grief) operates simultaneously in scene, especially when she refuses to linger on Jonas’s echo. The nomadic penumbra functions as both witnesses and stakes, deepening her resolve without diluting focus. Final renunciation of passive mourning for active witnessing is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the shape of home”—is embodied through tactile memory and emotional truth, not abstract longing. Her internal conflict between avoidance and remembrance drives every micro-choice, from discarding the mercury glass to using her mother’s feather. The final renunciation of illusion is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the pain of seeding the memory. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy—grief resolves into clarity without lingering contradiction, missing a hairline flaw needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s guilt is embodied with precision—his fidgeting, tears that cannot fall, and tactile engagement with thread and labyrinth reveal interiority without diagnostic label-speak. His final choice (accepting the lesson, not altering the past) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the exile ends only through grace, not decree. Contradictory impulses—desire for absolution vs. belief in unworthiness—operate simultaneously in scene. The tiny silver king in his pocket crystallizes his transformation without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in lived contradiction—her defiance serves compassion, not rebellion. Her micro-choices (sharing forgotten details, refracting blame) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking ritual unity for truth. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied (“ink-stained fingers,” “tears cutting paths through dust”). The final renunciation—forgiveness as witness, not erasure—is earned by prior causality and carries communal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in grief and love, with micro-choices (e.g., matching fractures to pockmarks) revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal conflict—between despair and creation—is embodied through trembling hands, breath-holding, and tactile memory-quilting, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (“to remember the wholeness she brought, not the breaking”) is earned by prior causality and carries profound emotional cost. Flaws like uncertainty are integral to his method, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in memory and grief, and his internal conflict—clinging to sorrow as devotion versus releasing it—is rendered with embodied specificity (e.g., “pigment-stained fingers,” “salt air cleansed his spirit”). The final choice feels earned, with visible cost: he relinquishes the physical vessel of his promise. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“beauty resides in the fractures”) that borders on label-speak, though it’s offset by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, white knuckles, and silent whisper reveal grief and resolve without therapy-speak. His motivation (proving whispers travel farther) is rooted in personal loss and tested through action. Silas’s transformation feels earned, not sentimental, as his tears and softened bluster respond directly to Elias’s ritual. The final shoulder touch crystallizes mutual vulnerability without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “patchwork” body mirrors her emotional landscape, and micro-choices (soldering the filament, pocketing the censer foot) reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation is consistent and intensifies through tactile memory rather than exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; grief manifests through sensory triggers like rosin scent summoning Kael. Final endurance (“carrying Kael forward”) is earned by prior ritualized action with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness and desperate rationality are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., blunt honesty at the checkpoint) and drive her actions with credible internal contradiction. Her motivation—psychological safety for Lena—is dramatized through ritualized care, not stated abstraction. The emotional stakes feel urgent yet restrained, avoiding therapy-speak. However, Lena remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth, though this fits the single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interiority is richly embodied—his “softly persistent” need to decode the Edelweiss arises from a lifetime of witnessed isolation, not abstract empathy. His micro-choices (pressing the flower into the log, adding “Witnessed”) reveal a hierarchy of values: bearing witness over solving. The final tear is kinship, not pity, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His contradiction—solitude as both burden and purpose—is sustained without resolution, deepening his credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s empirically intuitive nature is embodied in his ant-following decision, not merely stated, and his internal conflict between evidence and longing shapes every key choice. His emotional arc—from solitude to resonant connection—is earned through concrete action (e.g., kneeling in damp stone, trusting tiny guides) rather than abstract realization. The final renunciation of map-bound navigation for heart-led intuition carries visible cost: the chip cools, inert, marking the end of one era. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; tears blur vision only after the archway’s appearance, making emotion consequential, not performative.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lyra’s internal contradiction—between duty and yearning—is rendered through embodied choices (discarding the cloak, pausing on the ledge) rather than abstract reflection. Her softly commanding voice reemerges as action, not label, and her final renunciation of withdrawal is earned by prior causality. The silver fox encounter deepens interiority without dialogue, revealing vulnerability through shared breath. No diagnostic self-awareness mars her epiphany; the cost of her past silence is felt in the kingdom’s “wounded spirit.”

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied and consistent, with micro-choices—like aligning the shell or selecting pigments—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Kael and Lyra function effectively as a crucible, their whispered secret forcing Elara’s alchemical intervention. However, their internal states remain lightly sketched, limiting full reciprocity in the relationship dynamic. The absence of contradictory impulses within Elara herself slightly softens the emotional complexity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his jealousy of past selves, trembling hands, and feral nostalgia manifest as visceral, contradictory impulses rather than abstract reflection. His motivation to “distill terror into narrative” drives concrete action (unrolling the scroll, entering the dream), and his final choice to reroll the scroll embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost: he accepts chronological confusion but reclaims agency through storytelling. The micro-choice to focus on pines and dissolve wakefulness directly triggers the dream sequence, aligning motive with method. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels authentically layered and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—repair as empathy—is rooted in her loss and expressed through tactile, embodied choices under pressure. Her internal contradiction (loss vs. purpose) manifests in micro-decisions: tracing wear patterns, pouring silent prayers into metal. Mrs. Gable’s vulnerability acts as crucible, forcing Elara to translate emotional terrain into mechanical precision. The final click of the screw embodies a credible endurance that forecloses despair with visible cost: her trembling calm is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—transforming scars into stories—is embodied through tactile memory, micro-choices (holding breath, shedding a tear), and emotional contradiction (fear vs. resolve). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering trauma through sensory recall (“ghost of shattering glass”) and physical response (“tremor ran through her wrist”). The final reconfiguration of scars into luminous narrative feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in vulnerability and surrender. Her flaws (suppressed fear, scholarly dismissal of superstition) directly complicate the ritual, making the resolution a credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s guilt is viscerally embodied—her trench coat, trembling fingers, and raw apology reveal a deeply flawed yet credible penitent. Her internal conflict between journalistic ruthlessness and spiritual remorse operates simultaneously, not sequentially. The micro-choice to uncork the perfume—not as ritual but as surrender—feels earned and costly. Valerius’s spectral presence functions as crucible, forcing her to confront harm she cannot undo.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in her role as witness. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through sensory memory (e.g., “scent of rain on the last historian’s robes”). Contradictory impulses—solitude vs. love for what’s lost—act simultaneously during key beats. The final renunciation (“I am”) earns its weight through prior introspective struggle, though the transformation from witness to weaver slightly glosses the cost of that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The shepherd’s interiority is vividly embodied—his obsession with time’s nature, his tactile ritual with the key, and his emotional arc from strain to peace feel earned and specific. His micro-choices (counting backward, focusing on the droplet) directly reveal his hierarchy of values. The epiphany avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in sensory experience (“clarity of the vanished horizon”). His “eminently peculiar” trait isn’t a label but a lived constraint that shapes his entire method and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between control and permeability—is rendered with concrete embodiment (laser pointer, spatial mapping) and credible emotional layering. Her motivation intertwines professional rigor with grief, avoiding therapy-speak. Kael’s presence functions as a crucible, not a prop, and their micro-choices (pausing, speaking, pressing the button) reveal hierarchies of value. The final renunciation of rigid security for integration feels earned, though the transition from solitude to connection leans slightly on lyrical assertion over behavioral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “theoretically rebellious” nature manifests in tangible choices that bridge logic and compassion. Her micro-decisions (lighting the lantern, kneeling at Seat 2A) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. The father’s absence is felt through memory without head-hopping, and her flaw (intellectual detachment) directly shapes her arc. The final renunciation of pure rationality is earned by prior causality and charged with clover melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in loss and estrangement, and her micro-choices—answering the phone, tracing the disc, humming a scale—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on transforming grief into connection. Her internal contradiction (solitude vs. purpose) manifests in real-time action, not summary. The man’s voice provides external pressure that catalyzes her philosophy into practice, but his characterization remains functional rather than fully dimensional. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through sound, touch, and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, love, and ritualistic precision manifest in tactile actions (tracing the locket, measuring steep time) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation (“preserve the weight of small moments”) is consistent, specific, and drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“carry our small moments as blossoms, not stones”) is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No stock phrasing; her contradictions (joy/ache, preservation/release) operate simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to cure loneliness through shared crisis—is vividly embodied in her jocularity, moon rock ritual, and logistical rigor. Her internal contradiction (armor vs. yearning) manifests in micro-choices: quipping to survivors, clutching the stone, then relinquishing it. The final act of giving the rock is earned by prior causality—the Nepalese astronomer’s reciprocity, the avalanche mission’s trust economy—and forecloses her old path with resonant cost. However, the transition from “desperately jocular” to serene clarity risks slight over-rationality; the epiphany leans conceptual rather than fully embodied in trembling hands or choked breath.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skin “absorbs the earth’s languages,” grief manifests as a clouded inner compass, and her choices (e.g., trusting the ring over thorns) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation is consistent and intensifies toward emotional resolution. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her path is largely unidirectional, with sorrow channeled cleanly into quest. The mentor’s memory feels reverent but not actively conflicting, softening the edge of true struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath fogging the visor, thumb tracing the bent nib—and her motivation (“to thresh meaning from the chaff”) avoids redemptive cliché. Her contradictory impulses (confidence vs. doubt, agency vs. guilt) act simultaneously in scene, especially during the memory re-entry. The unbending of the pen mirrors her psychological shift, and the final choice to “carry the threshed meaning home” is earned through prior causality with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; even high-concept reflections remain grounded in tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in loss and expressed through embodied ritual—his signing is tactile, specific, and emotionally charged. His internal contradiction (grief vs. hope) manifests in real time during the encounter with Lily, culminating in a credible endurance that reconfigures his solitude into shared purpose. The girl’s presence doesn’t resolve his pain but reframes it, avoiding tidy closure. Minor deduction: Anya’s backstory, while poignant, leans slightly toward summary rather than dramatized micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “volcanic tenderness,” scarred hands, and analytical intuition manifest in micro-choices (lifting the fragment, humming the melody) that reveal his reformed hierarchy of values. His past as an arsonist isn’t just backstory but active contradiction: fire vs. preservation, destruction vs. mending. The emotional progression from regret to grace feels earned through tactile, sensory engagement with artifacts, not diagnostic self-awareness. Final renunciation of fire as liberation is credible because every prior beat constrains him toward reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in his role as a memory-keeper for his fractured community, and his internal conflict—between grief and hope, rebellion and creation—is rendered through embodied action (drumming) rather than abstraction. His micro-choices (e.g., choosing *this* cosmic breath, striking specific surfaces) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: the dream dissolves, yet he resolves to return. However, the absence of on-page interaction with other characters limits relational crucible testing, and the interiority, while poetic, occasionally edges toward lyrical generalization (“auroral sorrow”) without grounding it in physiological specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is embodied in every micro-choice, from navigating acoustically to rejecting Vale’s shouting. His internal contradiction (competence vs. quiet humility) manifests physically through restrained gestures and tactile interactions with map, coin, and key. Emotions are rendered through sensory detail (“storm’s charged air humming against his skin”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of force isn’t tidy; it carries the cost of being perpetually underestimated, crystallized when Vale admits he “dismissed your maps as relics.”

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s spiraling calm and Elara’s embodied tension are rendered with precise, non-diagnostic specificity. Their micro-choices—Kael angling the mirror, Elara tracing starlight—reveal hierarchies of value without exposition. The silent empathy dynamic functions as crucible, transforming isolation into shared resonance. Final release feels earned through tactile, visual cues rather than internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his calloused fingers, reverence for the knight, and silent attunement to students’ unspoken thoughts reveal a character defined by restraint and deep empathy. His motivation (“to plant forests of second thoughts”) emerges through action, not exposition, and his final choice—to advance the white king into vulnerability—mirrors his life’s work with visible cost: he risks irrelevance in a town “grown rigid with certainty.” Leo’s arc from “I am not enough” to “I belong” is earned through Elias’s non-interventionist pedagogy, showing relationship as crucible without overstatement. The only flaw: minor emotional summarization in “symphony only he could hear,” though quickly grounded in specific student voices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—between her violent past and yearning for peace—is embodied in precise physical detail (“calloused hands gentle on the hemp ropes,” “discarded cutlass sink into the abyss”). Her motivation is consistent, rooted in trauma and moral clarity, and culminates in a credible renunciation that forecloses violence with visible emotional cost. The final choice to surrender shame is earned through micro-choices (releasing specific memories) rather than abstract epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—his performative blankness versus private anguish—and his micro-choices (whittling, narrating, placing the sparrow) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The moral ambiguity around using Elara’s bouquet as a ritual prop deepens his flaw without safety-hedging. His emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, layering hypocrisy (masking grief as kindness) and self-deception credibly. The final tear and softened face earn the shift through prior causality, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s motivation is aesthetically driven and consistent, with embodied emotion in tactile interactions (e.g., brushing the quartz pillar). However, internal contradiction is minimal—the character moves with near-absolute certainty, reducing psychological friction. The final renunciation of division feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond abstract “peace,” weakening the emotional stakes. Still, micro-choices like whispering paraphrases reveal a hierarchy of values centered on beauty over tradition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “innocently cunning” trait manifests through deliberate, tactile choices—her plant arrangement is both invitation and key—and Kael’s arc from shame to revaluation feels earned through embodied interaction with glass and sound. Their motivations are consistent, rooted in sensory limitation and artistic trauma, and the final exchange reveals a credible hierarchy of values: truth over perfection, resonance over silence. However, Kael’s emotional shift leans slightly on declarative insight (“beauty lived in the honest scar”) rather than fully dramatized struggle, softening the cost of his transformation. Still, their flaws actively shape decisions, and the relationship functions as crucible without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in personal history and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., using the carbide lens, ringing specific bells). Her internal conflict—between archival precision and emotional resonance—is shown through action, not summary. However, Dr. Aris remains a functional foil rather than a fully pressured secondary character, limiting relational depth. The final renunciation of “archaeologist” for “gardener” is earned, but the cost is conceptual rather than materially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, calloused palms, and grief-weighted perception ground her emotional arc in tactile specificity. Her micro-choices (folding the crane, parting the curtains) reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring Lena’s legacy over personal despair. The contradiction between “genuinely artificial” artifice and “authentic hope” fuels her credible transformation without tidy resolution. Final action—steady hands returning to silver wire—earns renewal through prior causality with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied through ink-stained fingers, vellum choices, and inherited tools; Leo’s erosion of confidence feels visceral in his dripping posture and rough voice. Their interaction reveals contradictory impulses—Elara’s curiosity versus her inherited duty, Leo’s skepticism versus his need for meaning—without therapy-speak. The final micro-choice (gifting a map section) carries visible cost: Elara parts with her work, Leo accepts vulnerability. Both characters read as individuals shaped by specific worldviews, not archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her people’s survival, and her internal conflict—balancing grief and joy, memory and clarity—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., shattering sorrow with absurdity). Her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, balance over nostalgia. The fracture of her “innocence” feels earned, not declared, and the final renunciation of sentimental blindness carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradictory—her reverence for stasis clashes with her role as witness, culminating in a credible, costly shift. The river stone anchors her emotional arc without diagnostic self-awareness, and her micro-choices (retreating to the archive, comparing footage, placing the stone) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her flaw—fear of change masquerading as preservation—is consistent and drives her misjudgment of the shadow. The final surrender is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old identity with luminous regret as tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her shame, fear, and resolve manifest through tactile actions (cradling the tail tip, sketching modifications) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (open-heartedness vs. self-protection) operate simultaneously during her “shedding” ritual, not as sequential realizations. The final choice—to integrate discernment without hardening—is earned by prior causality: betrayal shatters her worldview, compelling reconstruction. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the “wise gatekeeper” visualization, which edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her scar, coffee rings, and telepathy reveal a consistent, flawed psyche. Her contradiction (seeking closure by reopening wounds) drives credible micro-choices, like ignoring stitch pain to study the ring. The final renunciation feels earned, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. No diagnostic label-speak mars her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to locate where unused love is stored—is vividly embodied through her spatial imagination and tactile engagement with the film strip. Her internal contradiction (seeking emotional truth via celluloid rather than crystals) manifests in concrete perception and action, not abstraction. The final renunciation—accepting that unused love resides in release, not vaults—is earned by the psychometric immersion and resonates with visible emotional cost. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, fear, and yearning manifest through tactile sensations (cold air, warmth of purpose) and concrete memories tied to the astrolabe. Her motivation—to free creativity trapped by grief—is consistent and intensifies credibly through micro-choices (tracing meteors, surrendering to rest). The internal conflict between fear of pain and desire for expression operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. However, the resolution leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“creativity flows from wholeness”) that borders on articulated epiphany rather than purely dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dreamless freight guard’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in vow-bound duty, and his emotional restraint—shielding the archive by sacrificing personal grief—creates a compelling interior contradiction. His micro-choices (kneeling in shadow, humming the lullaby, focusing on the spark) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: an emptied mind for preserved possibility. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of personal memory, making his quiet endurance feel earned. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is embodied through breath, touch, and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and embodied metaphor, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—rediscovering “the wild frontier of your mind”—is consistent and intensifies through his translocations and gear quest. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphanic tidiness; the shift from fear to trust lacks a concrete micro-choice that dramatizes internal contradiction under pressure. The final peace feels earned but borders on serene resolution without a visible cost beyond abstract “unraveling.”

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a consistent, embodied ache for unused courage, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels. The guides apply pressure through wisdom rather than conflict, limiting relational crucible depth. Her final choice—placing the ticket over her heart—is earned by prior micro-choices (pausing, listening, breathing) and carries the cost of surrendering external validation. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene (only quiet resolve) prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—nerve-fire in her hand, tears freezing on dusty cheeks—and her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. truth, silence vs. remembrance) act simultaneously rather than sequentially. Her final choice to leave the door open and place the bolt on the desk is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. The junior bellhop’s nod crystallizes a micro-shift in relational stakes without overstatement. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her grief-stricken agency.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, consistent, and embodied through precise actions—mending charts, inscribing runes—but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; his emotional state remains serene throughout, forfeiting tension for grace. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, yet his diminutive scale versus cosmic power creates a compelling paradox. His renunciation of the throne feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in embodied grief and precise memory, not abstraction. Her internal conflict—between witnessing loss and reassembling paths—is dramatized through micro-choices like tapping rhythms that alter her relationship to the station and data. The younger self’s video log retroactively validates her instinct without convenient amnesia; the failsafe was buried in trauma, not forgotten by plot convenience. Final transformation from witness to keeper feels earned through consistent tactile ritual and emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in his identity as a mechanic and descendant of stargazers, and his internal conflict—between practicality and mysticism—is rendered through embodied choices (bare feet on permacrete, clutching opera glasses). His emotional arc avoids therapy-speak, instead using tactile anchors and sensory detail to convey anxiety and resolve. The final crystallization of “awkward confidence” into “unshakable resolve” feels earned through the stone circle’s resonance, not declared. However, the absence of any external character interaction limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insurgency scars, plant-telepathy, and moral calculus cohere into a singular, contradictory will. Her micro-choice to unseal the amber herself (against tradition) reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: rejecting passive hope for active stewardship. The final line—“Stories wait for readers with intent”—crystallizes her arc without diagnostic label-speak. No emotional flatlining; tears stream as vindication, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with trauma manifesting through somatic responses rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—smoothing the photograph, pressing her palm to the bench—reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring memory while choosing presence. The “quietly talented” trait is shown through botanical illustration and orchid care, not just stated. However, her motivation occasionally leans into articulated self-awareness (“anchor optimism in realism”) that edges toward therapy-speak, slightly flattening emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly: his shame over hollow artistry drives him into the cellar, where he confronts his own emotional avoidance. His internal conflict—fear versus love for his craft—is embodied in tactile actions (untangling threads) rather than abstract introspection. The final choice to reweave reality with compassion feels earned by his prior struggle, though the transition from despair to agency leans slightly on metaphor over psychological granularity. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “serene anger,” tactile perception, and deliberate wildness feel specific and consistent. His final renunciation of rebuilding the drone is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of tool, closure of inquiry). The contradiction between his obsessive drive and ultimate acceptance is rendered in-scene, not summarized. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory engagement and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict is embodied, not summarized—her “bravely conflicted” state manifests in micro-choices (thumb pressing transmit) under pressure. Motivation is rooted in moral clarity, not rebellion, and her flaw (duty vs. conscience) directly shapes the climax. The final renunciation of archival neutrality carries visible cost: she risks everything to catalyze truth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through physical sensation (“dizzying quiet,” “frantic rhythm of her heart”).

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifism and perception are vividly embodied through micro-choices—tying stems with her father’s scrap, sheathing the knife—that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her internal conflict (compassion vs. legacy) simmers continuously rather than alternating in summary. However, her flaw (“senselessly perceptive”) functions more as a narrative convenience than a source of genuine struggle or error, slightly weakening motivation depth. The renunciation of violence is earned, but the absence of a consequential mistake tied to her perception prevents full 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in grief for her daughter and the quest for Lyra’s echo—is embodied with visceral specificity, not abstraction. Her internal contradiction (calm focus vs. raw sorrow) operates simultaneously in key moments, especially when she channels grief into the rail spike. Every micro-choice (zigzagging, voicing silence, striking the vortex) reveals a hierarchy of values: compassion over capture, integration over control. The final renunciation—not catching but being remade by the echo—is earned through prior causality and carries profound emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her thumb tracing the pen nib, her wry chuckle amid grief—and her contradictions (logic vs. love, duty vs. sorrow) drive every micro-choice. Her motivation intensifies credibly from whispered tip to public correction, and her final act of drafting the article embodies both renunciation (of silence) and endurance (of legacy). The backstory about Alistair’s regret over Elias Croft isn’t summary but a pressure point that converges with her own, deepening her resolve without therapy-speak. Her flaw—trusting institutional silence—is confronted through action, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—guilt over dismissing her niece’s cry—is embodied with visceral specificity and drives every micro-choice, especially her hum of reconciliation. Her internal contradiction (guiding others while lost herself) manifests simultaneously in trembling hands and precise sonic translation. The final whisper “I hear you” carries visible emotional cost and reconfigures her self-perception without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in ink-stained fingers, breath catching, and the weight of amber.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in personal unraveling, and her socially perceptive trait informs embodied choices (e.g., mapping grief into mandala patterns). Her internal conflict—seeking meaning amid chaos—is rendered through concrete action rather than therapy-speak. The final renunciation of control (“Integrate”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of impermanence. However, her emotional state shifts with near-perfect calibration, slightly flattening the irrationality expected mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her retrocognitive traps versus her deliberate acts of repair—but the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choice buildup. Her motivation (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is compelling yet borders on abstract until grounded by the tessera and renaming. The elders’ opposition is voiced but not dramatized, limiting relational pressure. Still, her final release feels earned through tactile ritual rather than therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in love and artistic longing, with interiority rendered through synesthetic perception that feels character-specific, not decorative. Her micro-choices—humming the song, braiding echoes, pressing the tarot coin—reveal a hierarchy of values: remembrance over resolution, possibility over possession. The final renunciation (dissolving into light) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her form fades only after the duet’s essence is restored. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied as liquid light, caramel smoke, sapphire tears.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism and compassion coexist in tactile detail (“fingertips tingled,” “somatic markers”). Her micro-choices (surrendering to bodily cues, handing over the geode) reveal a hierarchy of values: empathy over proof. Maya’s grief is rendered with specificity, not as a foil but as active pressure. The only flaw: Elara’s shift from skeptic to believer borders on seamless, slightly underplaying the cost of her renunciation of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her role as witness and translator, and her interiority is rendered through embodied perception—calloused fingers, tears tracing grime—not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (kneeling, hovering, guiding the fossil) reveal a hierarchy of values: reverence over possession, transmission over retention. The final act of placing the fossil for future seekers embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost—she relinquishes direct custody to fulfill her purpose. No internal contradiction weakens her arc; instead, her quiet intensity intensifies credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her ritual and worldview, and her micro-choices—uncorking the echo jar, arranging buttons—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on communal memory over fatalism. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting through tactile, embodied actions (e.g., hands knowing “the precise weight of time”). However, the lack of contradictory impulses in-scene—she never wavers or second-guesses—prevents full 9+ eligibility despite credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—trembling hands vs. deliberate ciphering, caution vs. daring—and his final choice to offer the pillbox feels earned by prior micro-choices. Anya’s presence deepens the crucible without over-explaining; their shared history manifests in gesture, not exposition. However, the transition from isolation to reconciliation leans slightly on implied history rather than dramatized friction, softening the cost of trust regained. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak but borders on lyrical abstraction in the final thaw metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, regret, and quiet resolve rendered through tactile memory (the yarn needle), sensory awareness, and micro-choices like pressing the needle through fabric. His motivation stems from a layered past but crystallizes credibly in the present without therapy-speak or abstraction. The final renunciation of geographic fixation for love-as-practice feels earned, with visible cost in lost dreams and adapted care. Contradictory impulses—holding onto Elara’s promise while releasing its original form—act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—understanding why kindness anchors time—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: his “sharp gentleness” mirrors the beekeeper’s devotion and shapes every micro-choice. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile memory (“vanished hands,” “drowning bee”) and sensory focus. The final renunciation—not seeking escape but carrying care into the wasteland—feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his solitude and changed craft. No safety-hedging; his flaw is passivity transformed into purposeful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” interiority is embodied through tactile gardening and precise ritual, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to reflect light into dark corners—emerges through action, not exposition. The brief but potent interaction with Mateo crystallizes her emotional stakes without overstatement. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than actively simultaneous in scene, slightly limiting the depth of flaw-driven tension required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—translating isolation into independence—is embodied through micro-choices (carrying the sundial, writing the folio) and rooted in the visceral burden of Kaelen’s memories. Her internal conflict between being consumed by the past and stewarding it feels authentic, though the transition from anguish to resolution leans slightly tidy. The absence of other on-page characters limits relational crucible, but interiority remains concrete and specific. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion is carried through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her solitude, yearning for connection, and role as secret-keeper are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., not hoarding the spiral but using it as a key). Her final act of placing “home” in the spiral feels earned, with visible emotional cost: relinquishing isolation for kinship. Contradictory impulses (desire to connect vs. professional detachment) operate simultaneously in her hesitation before creating the installation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as a celestial signal interpreter, and his actions align with his goal of countering cosmic tricksters through resonance. His internal conflict—between institutional pressure and cosmic duty—is embodied in micro-choices like bypassing Croft’s filters and maintaining the broadcast despite personal risk. The cautiously hopeful resolve feels earned, not declarative, especially in the tearful moment of witnessing human connection restored. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized clarity rather than messy contradiction under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., climbing the organ loft despite panic) and drive her arc without diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation—ending the fallow period—is visceral, not abstract, and her final endurance (“wistful rebellion”) forecloses retreat with visible cost. Interior contradiction (fear vs. duty) acts simultaneously in-scene, not as alternating summaries. The only flaw: slight over-articulation in “rebellion could be a resonant chord,” bordering on label-speak, though redeemed by immediate tactile closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s face blindness isn’t a gimmick but the engine of her perception, driving her to seek truth in texture over features. Her interiority is concrete—fingers reading moss, pulse stilling at a groove—and her emotional arc culminates in a vulnerability that feels earned, not therapeutic. The final choice to present Clara’s story as silk and stone, not reconstructed face, aligns perfectly with her established worldview. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in tears falling on journal pages, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in ancestral justice, and her “nervously confident” resolve manifests in concrete micro-choices—pressing the nail to the page, confronting the technician—that escalate under pressure. Her internal contradiction (idealism vs. dread) is embodied, not summarized, and her emotional state degrades believably as the tsunami looms. The final renunciation of exile—both personal and ancestral—is earned through prior causality. However, the technician’s swift conversion lacks reciprocal interiority, slightly flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—sculpting possibility from the ashes of “never”—is rooted in a specific, dramatized loss (the bridge collapse silencing his music) and intensifies through micro-choices: placing the glass flake on his strings, choosing to play rather than mourn. His interiority is concrete (“dynamically observant nature cataloged every impossible detail”) and avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied in tactile responses to wind, dust, and vibration. The final act—composing anew—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: renouncing elegy for blueprint. Flaws (abandonment of music) directly shape his transformation without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied calm contrasting his father’s volatility. His micro-choices—leaving the money, guiding Kai—reveal a hierarchy of values earned through prior causality. Kai’s idealism serves as effective secondary pressure without overwhelming focus. The final renunciation of domination carries visible cost: surrendering inherited trophies and startup identity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—fatigue, isolation, and epiphany rendered through tactile sensations (trembling hands, scent of brass) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a micro-choice to reinterpret the inscriptions as communal rather than solitary. The contradiction between her stubborn self-reliance and yearning for connection resolves organically through Kael’s intervention, with visible emotional cost transformed into shared purpose. No safety-hedging; her flaw of isolation directly fuels both crisis and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her "warlike serenity," trembling breath, and physical unbending reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Her motivation (truth beneath mirrors) drives every micro-choice, from kneeling to chanting to confessing. The frozen confession as her own cowardice reframes her guardedness as earned shame, not cliché. Final acceptance feels inevitable because each prior beat tightens the causal chain between rigidity and regret.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “anxious elation,” scar-linked memories, and root-bound devotion feel specific and consistent. Her motivation intensifies credibly through micro-choices (kneeling, tracing scars, pressing the clipping into the rift). The final act of mending the covenant is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: pain transformed into purpose. However, the trait “purposefully curious” borders on diagnostic label-speak in two instances without sufficient dramatization of its trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in specific, embodied regret—stealing Elara’s future—and his micro-choices (placing a petal, a stone, recounting her kindness) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His internal contradiction (fiercely gentle precision vs. past recklessness) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final act of absorbing sorrow is earned by prior causality and forecloses his old self with felt sacrifice. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile action and sensory memory.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, precise auditory hallucinations (C-sharp floorboards), and diagnostic self-talk reveal a man using expertise as emotional armor. His contradictory impulses (craving validation yet rejecting it) act simultaneously during the memory sequence, culminating in a credible renunciation of auction-house validation. The final choice—to chronicle unsung labor—is earned through prior causality: his roadie past, public failure, and tactile engagement with the cloth. Cost is felt in his relinquishment of external applause for quiet authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s haunted ambition and scholarly grief are rendered with precise interiority—his trembling hands, ritualistic documentation, and the seed as both talisman and burden reveal a man torn between empirical control and emotional surrender. His final choice to plant rather than measure is earned through decades of failed observation and a single analogical leap rooted in his profession. The micro-choice to whisper Akkadian instead of recalibrate instruments crystallizes his reconfiguration with visible cost: abandoning the quest to retrieve Elara in favor of honoring her memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in moss-brushing, tear-traced dust, and pen-on-journal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her fluctuating identity, reverence for wonder, and acceptance of contradiction feel embodied, not abstract. Her micro-choices (placing the creel, whispering to shards) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost. No therapy-speak; emotions arise through tactile ritual and sensory detail. The moon-phase self-concept deepens her resilience without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and professional identity, and his internal conflict—between isolation and connection—is rendered with concrete embodiment (e.g., the pearl’s warmth, phantom echoes of drills). His final choice to release the pearl feels earned, though the emotional transformation leans slightly toward the epiphanic without sufficient micro-resistance in-scene. The inspector’s trained perception (“hairline fractures in steel”) credibly informs his noticing of the shell’s carvings, grounding his arc in character-specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—self-forgiveness for her silence during her father’s final weeks—is embodied with piercing specificity through the accordion, the map, and her hyper-observant perception. Her internal conflict manifests as simultaneous impulses: methodical control versus raw vulnerability, avoidance versus confrontation. The patched bellows and water-stained map aren’t just symbols but constraints that shape her micro-choices. Her final act—playing middle C despite imperfection—feels earned because it emerges from accumulated emotional sediment, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her silence, her quest for unspoken words—and intensifies through micro-choices like transcribing fleeting text and finally writing her apology. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead embodying emotion through tactile responses (“propagation delays of warmth across her skin”). The final act—speaking aloud—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of vulnerability. However, the confidence man exists only as memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—ink-stained fingers, plant-attuned sorrow, the “stone in her chest”—and her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. propagation) act simultaneously in the climax. Her choice to sacrifice the violin is earned through prior micro-choices: reading coffee stains, recalling the mulberry’s song, rejecting the Director’s dogma. The cost—loss of the artifact, tears of “crushed berries”—is viscerally felt and thematically resonant. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in a vow, and her micro-choices—placing the chip, focusing on memory—are consistent with her role as “beautician mortician.” Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying perception through cosmic metaphors (“galaxies in nerve impulses”). However, internal contradiction is minimal; she operates with near-perfect clarity under pressure, reducing emotional friction. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but an acceptance, which feels earned yet lacks palpable struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in decades of solitude and a recent act of forgiveness. Her “kindly decisive” nature manifests through micro-choices—climbing the yew, carving the basin—that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is muted; her emotional arc leans toward resolution without palpable struggle or irrationality, flattening complexity. The epiphany about contentment feels earned but lacks the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s internal conflict is embodied through the mirror shard and cloak, with contradictory impulses—guilt versus hope—active in scene. Elara’s “sincerely insincere” approach is subtly dramatized, not labeled. The final unhooking is earned by prior emotional buildup, though the tear feels slightly abrupt. No diagnostic label-speak; vulnerability is shown through physical tremors and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s reverse aging is embodied with visceral specificity—his joints stiffening “less,” memories of his daughter’s adult face fading while baby powder scent returns. His internal conflict between clinical detachment and withheld grief manifests in micro-choices: selecting the stone, casting it gently, withholding Elara’s farewell. The final renunciation—choosing pedagogical patience over emotional urgency—is earned through decades of lived inversion and crystallizes with luminous cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory residue and ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Corbin’s motivation—navigating without moving—is rooted in his physical fragility and spiritual reverence, intensifying through embodied perception (e.g., the arrowhead vibrating in his palm). His internal conflict between stillness and yearning is rendered through concrete, character-specific detail, not abstraction. The final choice—to become the bridge—is earned by prior causality: his decades of observation, reverence for dust-as-text, and attunement to birds. Cost is visible: he foregoes physical journey for eternal anchoring, his body becoming part of the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—her shame, longing, and reverence manifest through tactile memories and deliberate gestures, not diagnostic labels. Her final renunciation (leaving the keystone) is earned by prior causality: each micro-choice (unstrapping expectations, planting the seed) reflects a consistent hierarchy of values. The cost—social exile, professional dismissal—is felt throughout and crystallizes in her Earned Stasis. No safety-hedging; her flaws (slowness, resistance to automation) directly shape her path.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—hiding behind facts while yearning for emotional truth—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., clutching the key tag, deflecting with tide mechanics) and collapses credibly at the logbook’s revelation. His motivation intertwines grief and wonder without sentimentality, and his final softening feels earned, not abrupt. The flaw of emotional avoidance directly shapes his tactics and costs him years of closure. No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges through tactile discovery and sensory memory.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” manifest through tactile ritual (coin-casting, resin-touching) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation (“to wavelength align with purpose”) emerges organically from her role as witness, not abstract yearning. The final choice isn’t a decision but a confirmation of identity, foreclosing action in favor of sacred remembrance—a credible Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her perception degrades appropriately under static bursts.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in grief and love, with interiority rendered through embodied sorrow (“tears of pure energy,” “hollow of his being”) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—activating the phonograph, focusing light, whispering names—are precise expressions of his hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses (desire to honor Elara vs. pain of confronting unmourned goodbyes) coexist without resolution until the final crystallization. The transformation from crushing heartbreak to purposeful ache feels earned, with visible emotional cost woven into every action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in her "brittle devotion," with micro-choices—like adjusting the reed conduit and trusting faint vibrations—that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile observation and quiet persistence. The flaw lies in minimal internal contradiction; her earnestness never meaningfully wars with doubt, reducing psychological tension. Still, her credible endurance and renunciation of grand magic for patient attention earn a resonant, costly closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s “precisely humane” trait is embodied in her micro-choices—wrapping the bottle, rejecting bureaucratic erasure—and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding emotion in sensory memory (the cerulean liqueur) and physical sensation (“tightened her throat”). The grief is specific, contradictory (wanting to forget yet compelled to preserve), and tied to a tangible artifact. Her final act—carrying the bottle as a “compass of connection”—feels earned by prior causality and reframes loss as purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—logic versus intuition—is embodied in micro-choices (rejecting flame, tracing the river stone) and culminates in a credible synthesis. Her secretly sentimental trait manifests through tactile gestures, not labels, and her mentor’s memory shapes action without exposition. The final choice to weave copper wire feels earned by prior struggle, though the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over incremental causality. No head-hopping or knowledge violations; interiority remains tightly bound to her alchemist’s lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is vividly embodied through tactile memory (the parachute buckle) and micro-choices (revising the log as covenant). Her internal conflict between past failure and present duty manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous tension in muscle memory and deliberate action. The final renunciation of perfectionism for hard-won certainty feels earned, with visible cost in the tear and tightened burden. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through frost-kissed vines, breath mist, and pen scratches.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaela’s motivation—defeating numbness through integration, not force—is consistent and embodied in tactile choices (palms on glass, breath at the end). Her internal contradiction (void vs. need for feeling) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating states. The final renunciation of custody for presence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: surrendering legal victory for sacred symbiosis. However, the absence of a second active character limits relational crucible depth, slightly capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his identity as a puzzle designer who values patience over immediacy. His interiority is concrete—seed handling, workshop rituals, brookside reflection—and reveals contradiction: he seeks innovation yet resists market pressures. The final vow to protect the seed mirrors his professional ethos, showing credible endurance with emotional cost (abandoned project redeemed). However, the lack of interpersonal pressure or external opposition limits the depth of character testing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and love, his interiority rendered through embodied ritual rather than therapy-speak. His “mournfully eager” grace and micro-choices—like angling the nozzle or easing the throttle—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The story avoids tidy emotional resolution, showing sorrow and hope coexisting without contradiction. However, the child Clara exists only as an off-page memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    The guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained claws, parchment skin, tearing-vellum sob—and its contradictory impulses (homesickness vs. commitment to vigil) act simultaneously in the climax. The final renunciation is earned through prior micro-choices (studying frost-ferns, interiorizing beauty) and carries visible cost: rejecting home to honor hard-won peace. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory metaphor rooted in its librarian identity. Flaws (longing, loyalty) directly complicate the decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s stoic sensitivity and defiant hope are embodied through precise micro-choices—pressing her forehead to the metal, mixing blood with catalyst—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal contradiction (duty vs. self-authorship) fuels authentic struggle without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of vivification feels earned by prior failures, though the emotional shift at “when the penny dropped” leans slightly toward epiphany over gradual realization. No safety-hedging: her flaws (obsession, isolation) directly enable her breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in a lifelong, embodied quest that evolves organically into being rather than seeking. Her internal contradiction—chasing grandeur while the truth lies in silence—is dramatized through micro-choices (discarding assumptions) that carry visible cost: the surrender of validation, voice, and expectation. The Hollywood star fragment functions as both object and psychological mirror, grounding her epiphany in tactile specificity. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through grime-streaked tears and bone-deep resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his "resiliently positive" nature, which evolves into focused resolve rather than denial. His micro-choices—humming a shanty, turning the hourglass—are character-specific and embody his professional calm under cosmic pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal; his emotional state remains steady, lacking the messy friction that would elevate this to 9+. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucible, but within single-POV constraints, his endurance reads as credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in a childhood fever dream, and her internal conflict—between control and surrender—manifests through embodied choices (e.g., reinforcing the weave vs. yielding to eruption). The epiphany avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in tactile sensation (“rough abrasion of betrayal, silken warmth of forgiveness”). However, the final renunciation leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity without sufficient contradictory resistance in the moment of rupture, softening the cost’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in cultural loss and cosmic wonder, and Lyra’s arc from skepticism to poised understanding feels earned. Both characters embody "balancedly curious resolve" through micro-choices (e.g., Lyra tracing the link, Kael steadying her shoulder). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped—Kael’s grief and hope coexist but rarely clash in-scene. The final transformation lacks a visible cost beyond abstract “generational weight,” slightly softening the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a quiet covenant, not abstract altruism, and her actions under pressure—handling the hearing aid with reverence, modulating her voice for Lily—reveal a consistent, embodied interiority. Her curiosity drives tangible choices with emotional cost: she risks psychic vulnerability to trace fragile echoes. The final micro-choice—to deliver only the message, not the method—shows hierarchical values (protecting Lily over professional validation). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile detail and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in honoring his grandfather’s erased legacy. His claustrophobia and reverence are embodied physically (“knuckles whitened,” “boots splashing through seepage”) and evolve credibly under pressure. The final act—leaving the codex—is a renunciation that forecloses his personal quest but completes a generational circuit, with visible emotional cost (tears, rising tide). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, though the epiphany borders on tidy; it’s saved by sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her heartbeat count, tactile engagement with the shard, and ritualized ink work reveal a psyche shaped by bureaucratic erasure. Her motivation (to “fetch wisdom from failure”) drives concrete, high-stakes action, and her transformation from brokenness to purpose feels earned. The porcelain shard evolves from trauma relic to compass, signaling internal reconfiguration without diagnostic self-awareness. Minor deduction: the leap from personal grief to systemic advocacy in the final lines slightly outpaces on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—translating tactile memory into sound to preserve a dying language—is deeply rooted, consistent, and embodied through her copper-veined hands and precise vocalizations. Her internal conflict (duty vs. legacy) manifests not as abstract angst but through micro-choices: matching bird patterns to stone textures with quiet articulation under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the diamond in the tunnel—is earned by sixty dawns of observation and exacts a visible cost: the weight of centuries lifting only after she fulfills her vow. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture, texture, and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s bitterness and skepticism are concretely embodied—white knuckles, internal scoffing—and her transformation is earned through witnessed wonder, not epiphany. Her final choice to protect rather than expose feels causally inevitable, with visible cost: the abandonment of academic redemption. Lyra and Elara apply immediate pressure through their actions and revelations, though Aris’s internal contradiction (skepticism vs. longing) could be more simultaneous in key beats. The diagnostic label “bitterness” borders on over-articulation but is offset by physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a quiet resistance to mechanical sterility. Her internal conflict—between futility and persistent hope—is embodied through tactile actions (tearing fingers on thorns, pressing the locust shell to her chest). The final choice to uproot vines feels earned by prior micro-choices, though the emotional progression leans slightly tidy. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in his sister’s broken promise, and his interiority—revealed through micro-choices like reprogramming drones and using the storm bottle—feels specific and embodied. His contradictions (protocol-abiding yet rebellious) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The ledger of absences shows a character-driven method, not a trope. However, secondary characters exist only as off-page references, limiting relational crucibles that could deepen his stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in profound loss and expressed through tactile, carpenter-specific choices. Her internal conflict—between silence and song—is embodied in her trembling voice and hesitant touch. The memory of Lily emerges organically from a concrete cue (the halo), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the transformation from mute grief to full-throated lullaby lacks intermediate micro-resistances, slightly softening the causality of her final act.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in analog memory and emotional resonance, with interiority grounded in tactile detail (e.g., the scarf’s texture). Her “sanely eccentric” trait manifests through hyperbolic crochet and cataloging, not just label. The flashback to her grandmother feels earned because it’s triggered by present sensory focus, not exposition. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional realization—no path is truly foreclosed, only reinterpreted.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in embodied longing—her mineral-stained fingers, the scent of jasmine, the cool marble—all concretize an ache that avoids diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (blending saffron and moonstone, cradling the palette) reveal a hierarchy of hope over despair. The final renunciation isn’t of the dream but of its external pursuit, earned through consistent ritual and emotional specificity. No therapy-speak; her epiphany arises from tactile communion, not introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s motivation is rooted in a specific, emotionally resonant backstory—freeing Elara’s trapped idea—and his actions align with quiet resolve rather than grandiosity. His internal conflict between duty and empathy is embodied in tactile gestures (thumb tracing the pouch, careful retying of the ribbon). However, Elara appears only in a distant, passive vignette; her lack of on-page presence limits relational depth. The final choice is earned, but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in chronic curiosity and fear, with embodied emotion (tears tracing grime, cold seeping through trousers). His internal conflict—between avoidance and the need to know—is shown through micro-choices (kneeling, sketching, uncorking the jar). The recovered memory avoids therapy-speak and emerges via sensory triggers, not exposition. However, the transformation from fear to release leans slightly tidy, missing deeper contradiction in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael and Elara’s contradictory impulses act simultaneously—Kael’s urge to retreat versus his resolve to mentor, Elara’s despair versus her emerging curiosity—and their micro-choices (walking backward, tracing tea leaves) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. Interiority is embodied through shard-mirror reflections and trembling hands rather than diagnostic labels. The final annotation (“Return”) is earned by prior causality: Kael’s method, the swing’s cyclical motion, and Elara’s own ritual. Flaws like Elara’s frustration and Kael’s anxiety complicate but don’t obstruct resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her perception of a fading “color of wonder,” and her actions align with her insatiably creative spirit. However, internal contradiction is minimal—her resolve hardens without meaningful struggle or doubt, reducing emotional complexity. The final choice feels earned but lacks the friction of competing impulses. Her tear conveys connection, not conflict, limiting the depth of her characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her scarred fingers, salt-tinged breath, and quiet murmurs reveal a fractured spirit without diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation to ground spirits arises from her own unrest, creating a resonant feedback loop between inner and outer stakes. The final whisper—"You are remembered"—is earned through micro-choices that reconfigure her identity from restorer to weaver of solace. No therapy-speak or tidy epiphanies; grief and acceptance coexist with credible contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to interpret silence with empathy”—is embodied through precise, tactile choices: restoring reels, aligning shadows, overlaying maps. Her “shielded openness” manifests as scholarly rigor fused with reverence, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (publishing quietly, carrying only understanding) is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost: stewardship over ownership. No internal contradiction is stated abstractly; it’s dramatized in her refusal to “fill silence,” only to listen within it.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s motivation—forged in Elara’s disappearance—is rendered with concrete specificity and embodied grief. His “quietly analytic” nature isn’t just stated; it drives micro-choices like timing glitter fall or splicing tape, revealing a hierarchy of values where data tempers emotion. The internal contradiction (clinging to Elara’s voice vs. seeking surrender) culminates in an Earned Stasis: he doesn’t erase grief but integrates it. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; his transformation feels causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in empathetic service to the voiceless, and her actions align precisely with her identity as a “seldom-heard balladeer.” Her interiority is rendered through concrete, sensory choices—carving symbols, counting seconds—not diagnostic labels. The story avoids over-articulation; emotions are embodied in tactile ritual (e.g., mist swirling around wrists, cool iron in palm). However, the lack of contradictory impulses or internal struggle limits full 9+ eligibility—her path is resolute, not conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss and consistently drives his actions, particularly his quiet handling of the diary and goggles. His interiority is concrete—embodied in tactile details like the satchel, the bench, and Lyra’s window box—and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The micro-choice to wear the goggles arises organically from his “warmly inquisitive” nature and grief, not plot convenience. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction; the transition from curiosity to “affectionate detachment” feels earned but lacks a visible internal struggle or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory impulses (calm surface vs. contained lightning) act simultaneously, not summarized. Motivation is rooted in grief and scientific heresy, driving every micro-choice: logging cloud-emotions, clutching the telescope, writing “peace” amid turbulence. The final renunciation—setting aside the telescope after completing the journal—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost: two years of solitude crystallized into acceptance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile detail (“ink a dark tear,” “sob quietly explosive”).

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness isn’t a gimmick but the lens through which her art, perception, and epiphany unfold. Her tactile sensitivity drives every key action—from noticing the anomalous book spine to decoding the coin’s fractal language—and her renunciation of mural-scale preservation is earned by decades of embodied struggle. The final choice (to walk away without looking back) crystallizes her internal shift with visible cost: abandoning her life’s work. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through brush-calloused thumbs and spatial memory.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her reverence, curiosity, and quiet determination manifest through tactile interactions with the ship and its artifacts. Her motivation (“to chart the next great discovery”) intensifies credibly into action, culminating in a choice that forecloses her passive vigil. The final act of pressing the hopscotch squares reveals a hierarchy of values: honoring legacy over mere survival. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through perception and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in mentorship, nostalgia, and the desire to learn “time’s gentle apology”—is consistently embodied through tactile memory (beeswax-scented tools, gnarled fingers on gears) and micro-choices (selecting the pick with her mentor’s ghost-grip). Her internal conflict between sentiment and technical necessity manifests in the tension between “listening” and “force,” resolved not through epiphany but through calibrated action. The final tear isn’t sorrow but fulfillment, a credible emotional pivot earned by prior struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is channeled through frost, light, and metal.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characters are vividly individuated through profession-specific actions and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., Lena tracing carvings, Kael’s pragmatic skepticism yielding to engagement). The family functions as a collective protagonist with clear internal dynamics, though individual arcs beyond Finn’s quiet trust feel slightly compressed. Motivation remains consistent and rooted in shared trauma transformed into stewardship. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the emotional realism.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied memory—her grandmother’s lullaby—and her actions consistently reflect that emotional core. Her internal conflict (preserving beauty through breakage vs. the inevitability of entropy) manifests in micro-choices: placing the puppet head, aligning frequencies, pouring memory into mechanism. The final renunciation—accepting dissolution while embedding love into spacetime—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her exhaustion, tears, and ultimate stillness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile (“tears traced clean paths through the dust”).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her reluctance, precision, and exhaustion are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., plucking the nut without disturbing dew). Her motivation—rooted in a blood-oath and duty to strangers—fuels every action without sentimentality. The final endurance (“she would repeat this ritual tomorrow”) is earned through visible cost and forecloses escape. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile restraint and calibrated movement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s internal conflict—between scientific ambition and relational ethics—is rendered with embodied specificity (e.g., “hollow success,” the chrysalis as tactile memory). His symphonic perception and professional identity shape his flawed choices credibly, and his final decision to integrate Elara’s ethics into his work feels earned. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“reflective ache,” “grief loosened”) rather than raw contradiction under pressure, softening the grit of true moral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a philosophical quest made tangible through her actions. Her internal conflict—fear of the void versus the courage to incise—is embodied in micro-choices (selecting the stone, pinpointing the coordinate) rather than abstract introspection. The final customer interaction reveals a subtle shift from solitary seeker to collaborative witness, with cost implied in the relinquishment of pure potential. However, the absence of a second fully pressured character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s motivation is vividly embodied—his memory-tasting ability and desire to “sandpaper rough memories” drive every action with emotional specificity. His internal conflict between absorbing pain and refining it is rendered through tactile, sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. The final endurance—subsuming the king’s remorse—is earned by prior causality and exacts a visible cost (“weight settled deep in his bones”). However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and the flawless emotional calibration slightly edges toward idealized competence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her “empathetically decisive” nature drives micro-choices like selecting specific languages for specific gears. Her internal conflict isn’t overt but implied through the weight of communal responsibility versus mechanical precision. The backstory of her own isolation (“a simple ‘Dobrý večer’… felt like a hand across a void”) grounds her empathy without therapy-speak. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves with near-perfect calibration, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—her engineering precision warring with her hunger for emotional chaos—but occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“synaptic plasticity,” “helix-minded”) that edges toward label-speak. Her transformation feels earned through embodied choices (arranging shards, meditating, weeping), and the cost of abandoning her former life is legible in her solitude and trembling body. However, the emotional epiphanies arrive with near-perfect calibration, lacking the irrational friction that would deepen credibility. The final renunciation of control is resonant but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in ancestral legacy and personal failure, intensifying under pressure with embodied emotion (“tears traced clean paths through dust”) and micro-choices (precision timing, silent reverence). Her prism-mind flaw—both gift and isolator—drives inevitable mistakes and genuine struggle. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception filtered through her unique cognition. The final renunciation of passive archiving for active restoration is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a “gentle, persistent ache” to converse with silence, not conquer it—embodied through tactile, sensory engagement with the sculpture and insulator. Her internal conflict (desire to heal vs. reverence for quiet) manifests in micro-choices: hovering fingers, breath-synchronized strumming. The final tearful release feels earned, not epiphanic, and her restraint (“not to shatter the quiet”) reveals a coherent value hierarchy. However, her backstory remains abstracted; the “silent world” premise lacks concrete personal cost beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his thumb tracing the dent, his precise movements echoing chess discipline—and his motivation (fidelity to intellectual purity) drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation isn’t defiance but devotion, earned through consistent causality. His emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; tears mix with road-dust, hope with melancholy. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (exile as discovery, fracture as grace) feel lived, not theorized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as an eclectic pacifist, and her interiority—concrete, sensory, and emotionally specific—never lapses into diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (e.g., tuning the resonator with “reverent precision,” choosing silent presence over words for Mr. Henderson) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on empathy as action. The internal conflict between her desire to heal and the pain of absorbing others’ grief is embodied in trembling hands and tears tracing dust on her cheeks. Her final renunciation of explanation in favor of companionship is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory sensitivity are consistently embodied, and her internal conflict—between mastery and surrender—is rendered through micro-choices (e.g., steady hands despite racing heart). The grandmother’s recalled wisdom deepens motivation without over-explaining. However, the final shift from ambition to wisdom leans slightly on declarative phrasing (“Ambition had softened into wisdom”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in ancestral legacy and ecological urgency, with interiority rendered through embodied sensation (“phantom weight of ripe fruit,” “grandfather’s planting song vibrating in his bones”). His micro-choices—dipping the twig, shifting from harvest to protection—reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The broken arrow tip functions as both heirloom and compass, grounding his emotional arc in tactile specificity. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany emerges organically from sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and profession-bound, with contradictions rooted in trauma and duty. His micro-choices—adjusting sensors, kneeling for the patch—are charged with personal history and professional rigor. The flight engineer’s patch functions as both relic and compass, embodying his flaw (over-trusting sky-born intuition) and his resolve. His final decision to institutionalize CFD assessments emerges directly from lived failure, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to certify wonder as essential—is vividly embodied through her synesthetic perception and ritual actions, not stated abstractly. Her interiority is concrete (“swirling silver mist,” “tears of joy froze on her cheeks”) and consistent with her role as a bell ringer attuned to cosmic harmony. The final choice—ringing the bell in precise alignment with auroral cues—is earned by prior setup and reveals a hierarchy of values (awe over safety or ease). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from sensory immersion and physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his regret, pride, and eventual humility manifest through tactile actions (arranging driftwood, handling the flute) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation (“to harvest insights from failure”) drives every micro-choice with escalating emotional stakes. The insight he gains feels earned because it arises from confronting a specific past error (ignoring tremors, wind’s whisper), not abstract guilt. His transformation—from rigid command to yielding reed—is crystallized in action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her yearning for emotional calculus versus her surrender to transposed empathy—act simultaneously in scene, culminating in a renunciation of control that feels earned. Her internal conflict is embodied through posture, breath, and pulse, avoiding diagnostic label-speak even at peak disorientation. The final choice to embrace ambiguity over capture aligns with prior causality and carries the cost of identity fragmentation resolved only through integration. Her borrowed voices harmonize believably because the story grounds their clash in tactile, sensory detail rather than abstract emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, frozen tears, and tactile connection to the pendant ground his emotional arc. His motivation (to coax wonder from routine) is consistent and deepened by loss, not just stated. The final shift from jittery courier to “living courier of wonder” feels earned through the pendant’s activation and the germination ritual. However, the transition from memory to myth leans slightly on declarative phrasing (“living bridge,” “tangible legend”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—proving objects absorb emotion—is vividly embodied through his tactile communion with frost and prism, and his internal contradiction (certainty vs. humility) resolves in a credible, costly shift. His anger and misperception feel human, not diagnostic, and his final renunciation of ego-driven proof carries emotional weight. The elderly Mrs. Gable, though off-page during the climax, exerts pressure through memory, grounding his epiphany in relational contrast. His transformation avoids tidy resolution, embracing nuanced self-correction without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: love defying time’s tyranny. Her interiority is embodied in tactile details—shoulders weighted with sorrow, translucent hands—and her micro-choices (clearing frayed threads, weaving memory into sacrifice) reveal a hierarchy of values with escalating cost. The latent sacrifice is not declared but enacted through dissolution of her present reality, making her endurance deeply credible. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises from action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—meekness transformed through quiet determination—and his sacrifice (his wife’s laughter) grounds his arc in tangible loss. His internal conflict between grief and duty manifests in embodied choices, not abstract epiphanies. The final smile feels earned, not sentimental, because it emerges from tactile labor and ritual. However, the lack of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—uncovering the truth about Kael—is rooted in embodied sensory perception and emotional ache, not abstract curiosity. Her internal conflict (accusation vs. compassion) manifests in real time during the weave, culminating in a micro-choice that redirects her intent. The final vision of Kael’s sacrifice is earned through this shift, with visible cost: the burden of truth becomes an anchor of love, not shame. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile detail (tears through grime, shard’s warmth) and constrained by her cyclically spontaneous ability.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s reticence and warmth are embodied through precise micro-choices—dismantling the cairn, selecting specific stones—that reveal his interiority without exposition. His motivation (“to bottle the feeling of safety”) is dramatized through tactile ritual, not stated sentiment. The final act of stacking enacts both grief and continuity, with visible cost in his “luminescent ache.” Contradictory impulses—duty vs. sorrow, silence vs. communication—coexist in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his guarded silence, crinkled eyes, and accidental laugh reveal a character shaped by paradox: prophetic power he cannot control, yet disciplined artistry he wields with precision. His motivation (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) manifests in micro-choices (tilting the wick, suppressing mirth) that carry visible cost (summoning the storm). The final smile is earned through prior restraint, and his solitude underscores the emotional price of his duty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and constrained behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “quietly explosive” depth contrasts with watchful restraint, and her micro-choices (withdrawing the wing, tracking sun trails) reveal a hierarchy of values. The donor heart isn’t just a symbol but a lived pressure shaping her perception and purpose. Her epiphany about Kaela feels earned through sensory ritual, not abstraction. Flawed yet coherent, she avoids diagnostic self-awareness while undergoing credible emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her vocation and worldview, with interiority rendered through tactile, specific perception (“grime on her cheek,” “pulse steady in her ears”). Her micro-choices—collecting dream fragments, aligning them with fractures—reveal a hierarchy of values that culminates in earned transformation. The final tear embodies connection, not sentimentality, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her flaw (quiet obsession) drives the arc without safety-hedging, and the resolution accepts its cost: she becomes a listener, not a solver.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in visceral, embodied memory—her fragmented mind and quiet ember of purpose drive every micro-choice. The swaddling, humming, and weaving are not just actions but extensions of her internal struggle, revealing a hierarchy of values (memory over forgetting, community over isolation). Her flaws—scattered cognition, grief-induced passivity—are actively overcome through song, not erased. The final stance crystallizes as earned endurance: she renews the realm not by fixing herself, but by integrating her scars into its fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, tears tracing cheeks—and her empathy drives both her past failure and present ritual. Her contradictory impulses (desire to belong vs. fear of exposure) act simultaneously during the projection sequence. The final choice—to remain in the library yet spiritually attend—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of physical absence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises from concrete sensory and moral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in sensory memory and her actions reveal a coherent hierarchy of values—nurturing the overlooked over mourning loss. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying grief and hope through tactile ritual (planting seeds, pocket crust). The tear into the soil and transformation of the bread relic show credible emotional progression with visible cost. However, Madame Lin remains slightly archetypal, limiting full crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role and worldview, and her actions align precisely with her “gently meticulous” nature. Interiority is concrete—her emotional response to fading frequencies is embodied through measurement and reverence, not abstract sentiment. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead showing devotion through calibrated observation. However, the lack of internal contradiction or competing impulses (e.g., doubt vs. duty) prevents a 9+ score, as her resolve remains unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in embodied loss and scientific curiosity, avoiding vengeance clichés. Her micro-choices—kicking sea glass, redirecting dockworkers—are precise, costly interventions that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over violence, legacy over revenge. Internal conflict simmers between her role as protector and documentarian, resolved not by epiphany but by action. The final whisper to Silas crystallizes her moral clarity without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus yearning—is embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., slipping on the ring, tasting lavender). Her transformation from doubt to acceptance feels earned, with emotional progression rooted in concrete stimuli rather than abstract epiphany. The grandmother’s memory functions as a credible emotional anchor without over-explaining. However, the resolution leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“empathic conduits”) that borders on label-speak, though it’s quickly grounded by the raindrop and taste of honey.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her charcoal-stained hands, trembling resolve, and mnemonic precision all manifest as character-specific contradictions under grief. Her final choice to draw on the calcite is earned through layered micro-decisions: breaking the lock, recalling Lily’s etching, pressing the mechanism into the niche. The emotional arc avoids therapy-speak, instead grounding sorrow in tactile detail (e.g., “vine charcoal, black as a starless night”). Flawlessly consistent motivation ties her artistic calling to legacy, not mere catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her wilting hands, aversion to lies, and yearning for lost conversations manifest physically and morally. Her contradictions (truth-seeker yet near-dishonest) intensify under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of archival ambition for “gardening moments.” The child and elder encounters catalyze micro-choices that reconfigure her stance with visible cost: she abandons the map’s promise for fragile human truth. Final acceptance of wilted orchids shows earned endurance, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her seasonal muteness and devotion to preserving wonder, with micro-choices like adjusting the silver cradle revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile perception—“vibrations traveling up through her boots.” However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her resolve remains unchallenged, flattening emotional complexity. The final renunciation—accepting the iceberg’s spent light—is earned but lacks visible cost beyond quietude.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit Seven’s motivation—resolving inner static through ritualized release—is rooted in consistent traits (nostalgia, caretaking) and intensifies credibly under pressure. Its internal conflict between preservation and liberation manifests in embodied micro-choices: retrieving the box, shaping sap into a lens, incinerating fears with precision. The android’s emotional progression avoids therapy-speak; instead, memory fragmentation and sensory detail convey distress. Final renunciation of fear-as-archive is earned, with visible cost: the irreversible loss of artifacts now transformed into ash that nourishes new growth.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in a vow to heal communal fractures through listening—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (e.g., storing Mrs. Gupta’s fragment “like a pressed flower”) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: patience over urgency, trust over possession. Internal conflict is subtly rendered through her restraint amid tightening deadlines. The final act—opening the locket not by force but through earned insight—feels inevitable yet emotionally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her dance as cognition, her fear of being forgotten, and her transformation of vulnerability into resolve feel deeply personal and consistent. Her micro-choices (rolling the dice, waiting for the third chime, turning the valve with dancer’s precision) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of despair in favor of “calm defiance” is earned through prior struggle, with visible cost in her isolation and emotional labor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through motion, image, and tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in the locket and her sister’s erasure, driving every action with emotional specificity. Her internal conflict—between communal forgetting and personal remembrance—is embodied through tactile details (calloused hands, salt-dusted tears) rather than abstraction. The final choice to seal the memory in salt crystal feels earned, foreclosing passive grief with active ritual. However, her competence in navigating gravity shifts lacks struggle, slightly softening the cost of her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in protecting communal harmony from a manipulative prophecy. Her interiority is vividly embodied through sensory engagement with the haven, and her micro-choices—exhaling the “smoothed hush,” directing awareness toward the fracture—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on compassion over control. However, internal contradiction is muted; she faces no meaningful doubt or competing impulse, reducing emotional complexity. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks the friction that would make it resonate as costly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)

Mrs. Davison’s patiently nimble care reveals status and emotional depth without exposition.

Her transformation from quarantine to integration feels earned, with visible cost: the surrender of protective isolation. The final act—carrying the crystal as a compass, not an anchor—crystallizes a renunciation that forecloses regression. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; grief is felt through moss, scent, and vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and morally textured—his trembling hands, calibrated treason, and grief over Elian feel earned, not abstract. His micro-choices (pressing the thorn, inserting the key) align with a lifetime of quiet sacrifice.

Final forgiveness isn’t tidy but woven through bodily sensation and memory, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her “richly perceptive nature”—drives every choice with emotional and moral specificity. Her internal conflict between curiosity and compassion manifests through embodied reactions (tears tracing dust, breath catching) rather than diagnostic labels.

However, secondary characters exist only as echoes, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—salvaging love from wreckage—is embodied in precise, tactile choices (handling the snow globe, penning the letter) and layered with quiet contradiction: she avoids summoning specters yet dives into dreams. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing itself through sensory immersion and micro-decisions (e.g., freezing tear vs. unburdened spirit). The final act—choosing compassionate truth over ghostly spectacle—feels earned by her consistent reverence. Cost is felt in her solitary vigil and emotional labor, not grand sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The net-mender’s motivation—appreciating hidden effort—is consistent, embodied in his mending and tea ritual, and culminates in a quiet but earned endurance. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile acts (e.g., knot-tying as homage). However, his “demure audacity” remains more thematic assertion than dramatized struggle; no true internal conflict tests his philosophy under pressure. The final choice—to walk home guided by moon paths—feels resonant but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation evolves with credible interior contradiction: her debunker identity clashes with the moral weight of preserving a lie. Her micro-choices—reburying the archive, weaving vines—embody her transformation without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (truth for guardianship) is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons her life’s work. No emotional summarizing; her resolve is shown through tactile, quiet action.

    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her belief that “salvation slept in the geometry of forgotten things,” and her lyrically prophetic voice embodies a quiet ferocity that feels consistent and deeply personal. Her internal conflict—between isolation and hope, chaos and meaning—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., leaning into the mic, slumping in exhaustion) rather than abstract introspection. However, secondary characters like Hemlock and Lena remain underdeveloped archetypes; their reactions serve theme more than individual psychology, limiting the depth of relational crucibles. The final renunciation of solitude is earned, but the cost of decades of isolation is implied rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vagrant poet’s motivation—translating generational memory through captured sound—is consistent and embodied in ritual, yet his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; grief and hope alternate rather than coexist under pressure. His micro-choices (cleaning the box, winding the key, sealing the jar) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time, solitude, emotional exposure. However, the epiphany about “gleaned redemption” edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient prior struggle to ground it as earned insight. The final act of etching “For Elara” carries emotional weight but leans on stated intention over dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s “logically emotional” nature is embodied in real-time micro-choices—filing the key’s tine with her thumbnail merges engineering precision and empathetic intuition. Her internal contradiction (logic vs. feeling) operates simultaneously during crisis, not as alternating summaries. The cost is felt in physical strain and emotional resonance (“pressure behind her eyes”), and her final stance crystallizes without epiphany. Motivation rooted in bloodline duty intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior conflict—impatience versus sacred duty—is embodied with visceral specificity (“impulse hummed like a trapped bird,” “fingers numb despite woolen gloves”) and drives every micro-choice. Her transformation from tension to abiding patience is earned through sustained pressure and culminates in a renunciation (surrender, not force) with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise from action and sensation. Final choice aligns perfectly with established motive and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in her escape from the society and reinforced by Thomas’s death. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead showing contradiction through embodied choices—e.g., kneeling in cold water despite emotional risk. The “watchful calm” isn’t just stated; it enables her meticulous documentation under pressure. However, the entangled memories slightly blur the line between perception and epiphany, risking a hairline slip in emotional realism at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt and moral burden are embodied with restraint—his rigid posture, the weight of the box, tear-tracked dust—all convey interiority without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to seek a second opinion reveals hierarchy of values (redemption over resignation). Motivation intensifies credibly from apology toward action. Final renunciation of self-punishment is earned by Horvath’s revelation and Samuel’s prior counsel.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to ring a bell no one hears yet”—is vividly embodied through her ritual with the kaleidoscope and the Yearning Algorithm, revealing a layered interiority that balances irreverence and awe. Her micro-choices (e.g., chuckling at a gear before bowing to insight) demonstrate contradictory impulses acting in real time. The final act of transliterating the circle is earned by months of oil-stained triumphs and failures, with visible cost in her grease-streaked tears. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile, specific, and tied to action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her “brightly attentive” nature and belief in digital afterlife. Her internal conflict—duty vs. truth—manifests in micro-choices (lying to Vance, encrypting Psi) with visible cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from curiosity to guardianship feels swift. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, but interior contradiction could be more simultaneous than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    The peacekeeper’s motivation—mapping empathy onto action—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies under pressure. Their internal contradiction (calm intuition vs. terror of fracture) manifests simultaneously in micro-choices: bypassing clutter to focus on mirrors, channeling emotional echoes into the fragment. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory perception and action (“shadow laced with indigo and silver,” “fragment unnaturally cold”). The final renunciation of flight for empathetic mending is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the weighted breath before reply.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “grip on reality” shifts from smoke-like detachment to tactile engagement through net-mending and the parasol tip. Her motivation evolves credibly from seeking an ending’s sound to honoring survival’s symphony, with micro-choices (delaying her appointment, choosing to sit with Lars) revealing a hierarchy of values. The sole flaw: the transition from euthanasia tourist to disaster volunteer lacks explicit causal friction; the shift feels emotionally earned but under-motivated in terms of concrete prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through embodied gestures and micro-choices, especially her handling of the burned letter and observation of the grafted vines. Clara and Liam show credible emotional shifts grounded in recalled specifics (vigil, wild roses), avoiding therapy-speak. However, their internal contradictions remain slightly underdeveloped—grief and misjudgment are stated more than dramatized in real-time conflict. The resolution feels earned but leans on summary rather than layered, simultaneous impulses during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in reverence, not pride, and his “strangely honest” trait manifests through unwavering fidelity to unvarnished truth. His internal conflict—between urgency and restraint—is embodied in micro-choices like softening his gaze and shifting weight to align with the parapet. The half-mask functions as both symbol and constraint, shaping his actions without over-explanation. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves cleanly from duty to fulfillment without visible struggle, slightly undercutting the “flaws complicate choices” benchmark for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied, with micro-choices—like opening the map case to a specific photo—that reveal her values. Liam’s arc shows credible emotional transformation rooted in concrete visual evidence. However, secondary characters (Mrs. Gable, teenagers, Mr. Higgins) function more as thematic echoes than fully individuated agents under pressure, limiting relational depth. The story skirts diagnostic label-speak (“collective healing,” “transmuted pain”) but avoids major interiority pitfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aris’s reticence, weathered innocence, and embodied emotional arc (tears tracing dust, rare smile) feel deeply consistent and earned. His micro-choices—listening with the crystal, climbing the ladder, leaving the teacup—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s precognitive forgetfulness manifests as embodied contradiction—she acts on vanishing visions with tactile urgency, her micro-choices (placing driftwood, carving symbols) revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in devotion to lost time. Her flaw actively complicates her goal, forcing reliance on external anchors. The final tear and chalk inscription “Remember” crystallize her internal struggle without diagnostic self-awareness. Cost is felt in the hollow longing after the vision fades, making her endurance credible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to harness the ephemeral—is embodied in her tactile, reverent repair work and crystallizes in her choice to listen rather than force. Her internal conflict between technical mastery and humility is rendered through precise micro-choices (e.g., ignoring the spinning hand to “listen solely to the gears’ distressed whine”). The final act of recalibration emerges credibly from forty years of practice and her mentor’s wisdom, with visible cost: the risk of missing the Veil. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, memory, and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arthur and Lena’s grief is embodied with restraint—clenched hands, silent lip movements, tears that relax shoulders—not therapy-speak. Elara’s “decisively kind” motivation drives action, not just observation. The shard of vinyl becomes a crucible for their relationship, culminating in a shared grip that reconfigures loss into connection. However, Elara’s interiority remains slightly opaque; her kindness feels asserted more than conflicted or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her scholarly identity and the altered reality, compelling her precise actions. Her interiority is embodied through tactile details—ink-stained fingers, steady hand with moonstone chalk—and her patience manifests as active endurance, not passivity.

No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her arc.

    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “weary resolve,” tactile handling of the tooth, and bone-setter’s ethos reveal a coherent, flawed mind under pressure. Her motivation intensifies credibly from private grief to communal purpose, with micro-choices (e.g., clutching the tooth, planning the garden) reflecting her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of vengeance for education feels earned by her consistent traits: skepticism tempered by compassion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action (“a sob escaped—not of grief, but liberation”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma (her fall, Liam’s fire-memory) and expressed through embodied action—stiff knee, polishing rhythm, fevered brow recall. Her internal contradiction (earthbound yet star-watching) fuels credible endurance, not tidy resolution. However, the epiphany about “distilling the cosmos” edges toward diagnostic self-awareness without sufficient friction; it feels earned but slightly over-articulated for a moment of quiet labor.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her envy, regret, and quiet agency emerge through tactile actions (tracing the pendant, kneeling on moss) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradiction—watchful yet proactive—is sustained and deepened by her ritualistic offering. The final renunciation (“not the entire story”) feels earned through consistent character logic. No safety-hedging; her flaw (public confession born of midnight despair) directly fuels her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The novelist’s internal conflict—between artistic integrity and external pressure—is rendered with embodied specificity, particularly in his tactile ritual with the seashell. His motivation to “collect the shapes of different hopes” avoids abstraction by anchoring in observed cameos, each imprinting a distinct emotional geometry. However, his passivity borders on observational detachment; while he “moves deliberately against the current,” his agency is largely receptive rather than decisive, limiting the stakes of his renunciation. The final peace feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond fatigue, softening the edge of his moral endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through her tinkerer’s details and thirty-year quest, with micro-choices (placing the tendril back in soil, rising with aching joints) revealing hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate heartbeats into maps—is rooted in a deeply personal, embodied connection to the orchard’s oldest tree, and her actions (blood-drop, pattern-making, alignment) are precise extensions of that desire. Her interiority is concrete: gnarled fingers stained with lichen, breath pluming in cold air, joints aching from vigil. The final choice—offering flash-paper to starlight instead of igniting it—subverts her craft in service of preservation, a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. The cost is felt: physical strain, emotional vulnerability, and the risk of failure in a fragile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is deeply rooted in his identity as a reflective locksmith, and his actions consistently align with his peripherally focused perception. His internal conflict—balancing reason and wonder—is embodied through tactile choices (e.g., crafting the pin from “reflected revelations”) rather than abstract musing. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy; his conviction remains unshaken, missing a moment of doubt that would heighten cost. The final renunciation of external validation in favor of quiet guardianship is earned, but the absence of a visible personal sacrifice limits the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a solemn vow that intensifies through embodied action. Her internal conflict—between compassion and the risk of emotional calcification—is subtly rendered through micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the thread’s angle) and the resonant memory of her childhood pebble. Emotion is never labeled but conveyed through tactile detail (cool whalebone, crystalline sparks). The final renunciation of detachment is earned, though the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile carving, not therapy-speak. Her “hauntingly practical” nature drives micro-choices (selecting tools, timing cuts to the kettle) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses coexist: containment vs. surrender, memory vs. chaos. The final renunciation isn’t escape but integration, earned by every precise cut.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her regret, chronological confusion, and resolute scavenger identity cohere through micro-choices (e.g., offering the camera wheel as an “offering of understanding”). The ghost negotiation avoids therapy-speak by grounding epiphany in tactile ritual. However, the internal contradiction between ambition and fear remains slightly abstracted in summary rather than dramatized mid-crisis. Final integration feels earned but leans on lyrical assertion over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “functionally creative” engineer who sees latent potential in decay, and her internal drive—to derive “equations for hope”—fuels every action. Her emotions are embodied (“breath a faint mist,” “throat tightened without a sound”) and never reduced to diagnostic labels. The final choice—redirecting flow rather than imposing design—emerges directly from her established worldview, with the cost being the irreversible commitment to collaboration over control. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her competence is balanced by physical struggle (scraping bolts, clearing stone).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensation and precise micro-choices—her trembling fingers, the excruciating gentleness of her movements—but the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“Her work as a clock scribe was not a betrayal of music, but its quiet cousin”) without sufficient friction from contradictory impulses in the moment. The renunciation is earned, yet the emotional shift lacks the irrationality or hypocrisy that would ground it in human complexity. Still, the final choice to leave the fork feels resonant and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—her shift from credulous seeker to discerning guardian feels earned through specific failures. Interiority is concrete (“calloused finger traced the rim,” “trained instincts now screamed”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of vengeance for documentation reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: her public shame and lost expedition. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward summary over simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her patience, reverence for seeds, and quiet urgency shape every micro-choice. The fisherman’s silent trust deepens their dynamic without over-explanation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through tactile focus (fingers tracing knots) and atmospheric immersion. Final renunciation of relic-thinking for method is earned, though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than simultaneous.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as an obituarist for the living, and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels in favor of embodied perception (“tears traced warm paths,” “warmth bloomed against her skin”). Her micro-choice to kneel and project presence reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over comfort—with visible emotional cost. Kael’s brief but resonant appearance functions effectively as a secondary pressure without muddying focus. However, Elara’s internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is deeply rooted in his obsession with beauty amid decay, and his interiority—fraught with hope, doubt, and reverence—is rendered through precise, embodied details (e.g., “stained hands,” “quaking reverie”). His final acceptance feels earned: not a reversal but a reconfiguration of purpose. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead showing emotional complexity through action (placing the tear, whispering the phrase) and sensory perception. His flaws—idealism bordering on delusion—are consistent and shape every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—shame and love for her father, legacy of fire versus vocation of preservation—is rendered with embodied specificity and sustained tension. Her micro-choices (pouring sand, embedding the coin, grafting kelp) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in compassion. The memory of grafting apple branches deepens motivation without over-explaining. However, the emotional resolution leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“compassion so deep it felt like gravity”) that edges close to label-speak, though it’s redeemed by immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “luminous skepticism” is vividly embodied through micro-choices—clearing moss, adding a penny, waiting for moonlight—that reveal her internal contradiction between doubt and hope. Her motivation is consistent, rooted in personal memory, and intensifies credibly as each clue validates her path. The final transformation from skeptic to keeper feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost in the form of emotional labor and temporal urgency. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in ancestral trauma and expressed through precise, embodied actions—adjusting the gear, emitting pings, weeping starlight tears. Her internal conflict between hope and fear of failure is consistent and woven into every micro-choice. However, her emotional state remains largely uncontradicted in-scene; she feels weight but never wavers, reducing tension. The final endurance is earned, yet lacks a visible renunciation that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—her grief scars, meditative focus, and tactile memory of ribbon and stone reveal character without therapy-speak. Her motivation to map collective sorrow through personal ritual feels earned, not abstract. The contradiction between her solitude and communal purpose simmers throughout, crystallizing in her memorial design. Final choice carries visible cost: she bears the weight of thirty-seven lives but transforms it into shared path, not monument.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s ethically diligent nature is embodied through micro-choices—cleaning the pivot with “reverent precision,” pushing the pendulum with “calibrated force”—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal conflict between legacy and duty manifests not as alternating summaries but as simultaneous impulses: reverence for the past and responsibility for the present. The rake handle’s inscriptions function as both memory and moral compass, grounding her epiphany in tactile history rather than abstract realization. Final inscription—“Cleared the grit. Honored the silence. Swung true.”—earns its weight through prior causality and visible cost: the community’s disarray without the clock’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a gardener who seeks order amid grief, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—her “blithe” nature smooths over tension rather than wrestling with it. The final choice feels earned, yet the absence of struggle or misstep undercuts emotional risk. Her trait “tenderly organized” informs action but doesn’t generate meaningful trade-offs. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving interior credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as an “ignorance cartographer” who maps possibility through disciplined observation. Her internal conflict—doubt versus certainty—is embodied in tactile hesitation (“hand did not tremble”) and resolved through rigorous self-audit, not epiphany. The trait “groundedly imaginative” manifests in action: her model integrates empirical data with creative insight to propose a physically plausible intervention. However, the absence of external pressure or interpersonal friction limits the demonstration of contradictory impulses in real-time interaction, slightly capping full character dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to teach dust to tell stories”—is deeply embodied, consistent, and intensified by pressure. Her micro-choices (draping the cloak, transcribing lyrics, adjusting posture) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risk of discovery for narrative resurrection. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile precision (“ink-stained fingers,” “pulse a frantic drum”). The final renunciation isn’t of action but of silence—she chooses active witnessing, foreclosing passive survival.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent—her role as ash scatterer drives every micro-choice with reverent precision. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (powdering porcelain, charcoal strokes) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final realization about vulnerability emerges organically from action, not epiphany. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline and consistent, rooted in his identity as a custodian of rational inquiry. His internal conflict—between revelation and preservation—is embodied in trembling hands and deliberate action, not abstract debate. The choice to hide the tablet is earned through prior causality (ten years of solitude, fear of Councilor Valerius) and carries visible cost: silence, continued isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile detail (silt-stained fingers, cold cog) and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “expectantly resigned” posture and internal contradiction—hope against futility—are embodied in micro-choices (placing the rosette, dimming lamps) that align with her motivation to braid voices without force. Liam and Anya’s gradual thaw feels earned through specific, non-verbal gestures (humming support, brushing hands), avoiding therapy-speak or tidy resolution. Their dialogue at the end (“sweetest apples,” “your father taught me”) crystallizes relational change without over-explanation. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched beyond their symbolic roles, slightly limiting depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlo’s motivation is clear and consistent—his desire to create beauty from ruins drives precise, meaningful action. His “informally wise” nature manifests through micro-choices (e.g., pruning with reverence) rather than exposition. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; his emotional state shifts cleanly from sorrow to hope without palpable struggle or competing impulses in-scene. The final renunciation of despair feels earned but lacks the friction of a genuine internal battle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s involuntary truthfulness is consistently embodied and shapes his actions, particularly in the climactic reveal. His motivation—to preserve wonder—is credibly dramatized through his handling of the lacquer box and riddle, not merely stated. The internal conflict between duty and poetic truth is subtle but present, though slightly abstracted by the lyrical register. Dr. Aris serves as effective pressure without overshadowing Kael’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding why houses feel alive—is embodied through precise, sensory-rich observation and micro-choices (e.g., kneeling to bury the shard). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion arises through tactile detail (“tears traced warm paths”) and contradiction (seeking answers yet accepting mystery). The final renunciation—shifting from search to witness—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she surrenders certainty for sacred attention. Her flaw (hyper-observance bordering on obsession) enables her insight without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—compassion through nuance—is consistent, embodied in his handling of the ampoule and projection of “incisively kind” thoughts. His internal conflict between permanence and change manifests physically (mineral tears, granite veins softening) and thematically. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding emotion in tactile imagery (silt mandalas, coral flushing). However, as a solitary figure with no interpersonal friction, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, limiting the depth of contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s grim optimism and internal contradiction—choosing abstraction over intimacy, then seeking redemption through rigor—are embodied in tactile choices (etching proofs, rolling dice) rather than stated. Her transformation from regret to peace is earned through the rupture’s sensory verification, not epiphany. The chipped die functions as both artifact and compass, grounding her flaw in physicality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through flint on stone, dice in pocket, breath on stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a quiet, consistent thesis about kindness, and her actions—grinding saffron, painting emotion rather than imagery, leaving the canvas at the bus stop—reveal a character whose interiority is both specific and embodied. The nurse’s response crystallizes Elara’s belief not as epiphany but as confirmation, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her insomnia transforms from affliction to purpose without over-explanation, and her micro-choices (e.g., watching from a distance) carry visible emotional cost. The only slight flaw: the elderly woman in the memory feels more archetype than individual, but this serves the thematic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a historically oriented guide, and her micro-choices—offering the lens, insisting on action—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on cultural continuity. Old Man Hemlock’s grief and transformation feel earned through embodied detail (tracing cold ovens, tears through dust). However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; Elara’s “quiet fire” lacks simultaneous opposing impulses, trending toward resolute clarity rather than layered struggle. The final choice is credible but leans on revelation over agonizing trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her “neatly inventive hands” and counter-clockwise craft—and intensifies into a high-stakes act of rebellion. Her internal conflict between despair and defiance operates simultaneously (“bleak exhilaration”), not as alternating summaries. The final choice—rewiring fate via the yoyo mechanism—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: tears through grime, the tide’s indifference, and the burden of tending a new chronology. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and precise perception.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The advisor’s motivation—to trick fear into revealing its weakness—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (between conquest and vulnerability) manifests in concrete choices: consulting the dream dictionary, forcing a lie of innocence, offering his emptiness as bait. The final renunciation—disarming fear through witness rather than domination—feels earned by prior causality. His photographic curse and emotional restraint are flawlessly integrated into his tactics and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward’s motivation is vividly rooted in ancestral loss and embodied through precise ritual actions, avoiding diagnostic interiority. His micro-choices—sketching cloud patterns, striking trees with calibrated urgency—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of force for harmony feels earned, though the absence of internal contradiction slightly limits psychological depth. His competence is balanced by visible strain, grounding his near-mythic role in human vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in trauma and curiosity, consistently driving her actions with quiet intensity. Her internal conflict—between loss and inquiry—is embodied in tactile choices (handling the whistle, studying the crack) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of fear in favor of walking toward the Watchers feels earned by her prior endurance and micro-choices. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aris’s emotionally rational nature is embodied through precise micro-choices—handling the letter reverently, choosing parallels over confrontation—and his internal conflict between empathy for the lie’s originators and duty to truth feels authentic. His motivation is consistent, rooted in familial legacy, and intensifies into action without melodrama. The trait “emotionally rational” avoids diagnostic label-speak by manifesting in voice (“no malice,” “understood the compassion”) and behavior (quiet recapture, not accusation). Final renunciation of the noble lie carries visible cost: loss of communal comfort, offset by integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s stoically sensitive interiority is vividly embodied—his reverence for stone scars, the ache in prying loose a cornerstone, unshed tears blurring ink—all reveal contradictory impulses (duty vs. devotion, restraint vs. empathy) without diagnostic labels. His motivation to “excavate silences” drives every micro-choice, from uncorking the inkwell to pressing notes into mortar. The final renunciation—walking away as water reclaims the pavilion—is earned by his consistent ritual of witness. No safety-hedging; his flaw (carrying too many untold stories) compounds but doesn’t paralyze him.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent: her “quiet fire” to verify historical truth drives every micro-choice. Her interiority is embodied (“tranquilly perceptive,” dust motes as “forgotten syllables”) without diagnostic labels. The final act—pressing the blank end of the stamp—is a renunciation of complicity, foreclosing silence with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. truth) coexist in her stillness, resolved not by triumph but “steady purpose.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in embodied grief—her shadow’s departure haunts her actions with visceral specificity. Her internal conflict manifests through simultaneous impulses: to preserve pain and to release it, enacted via gem polishing and crane folding. The tear-dampened cloth and origami ritual avoid diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in tactile craft. However, the absence of a second character limits relational crucible testing, and the final renunciation, while poignant, lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path beyond repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in trauma and theoretical physics, rendered with visceral specificity—her scarred fingers, the geode as resonator, the wedding-day drone strike. Her internal conflict pulses between grief and intellectual pursuit, embodied rather than explained. The final choice—to carry the map of potential forward—is earned through her precise mental nudge and the cost of witnessing erased futures. No therapy-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—decoding “the frequency of belonging”—is vividly rooted in his profession and longing, and his internal conflict between precision and yearning is embodied in his sharp eyes versus trembling hands. Elara’s “perpetually surprised” trait initially reads as label-only but gains emotional weight through her reactions to the orrery’s activation. The final intertwining of fingers earns its emotional payoff by crystallizing connection as the true constant, though the transition from solitude to intimacy leans slightly on implication over micro-choice. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and the protagonist’s flaws (obsession, isolation) complicate rather than obstruct his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile details (splinters, tiles, carvings) and his internal conflict between protective deception and respect for truth feels authentic. His motivation intensifies credibly from regret to resolve, culminating in a vow that forecloses his old path of evasion. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“underestimating her strength”) without enough contradictory resistance in the moment. The final choice is earned, but the emotional turn lacks a micro-hesitation that would heighten its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied failure—dismissing a weather warning that cost three lives—and his micro-choices (carrying the drawer pull, championing moon-phase synchronization) reveal a hierarchy of values: wisdom over pride, caution over haste. His internal conflict between shame and resolve acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and his emotional progression avoids tidy resolution. The final renunciation of burden for “earned wisdom” is causally earned by prior beats and carries visible cost—the softened memory, the transformed object. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fractured trust, tactile rituals (counting poles), and suppressed trauma manifest in micro-choices (e.g., refusing the compass until Venus appears). His motivation (“align heart and action”) evolves credibly from penance to pilgrimage, with visible cost: enduring shame, isolation, and the weight of unlost lives. The final choice—to navigate by both poles and stars—integrates regret with courage without erasing his flaw. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is razor-sharp and embodied—his tremor, the baseball, his visceral reaction to memories all ground his quest for empathy in physicality, not abstraction. His internal conflict (ruthlessness vs. yearning) operates simultaneously, especially at the lake when he stops fighting memory. The final choice—to place the ball on water—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; regret integrates with mercy through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—reforging a bond beyond death—is viscerally rooted in embodied grief (“a hollow space beneath her ribs”) and consistently drives her toward a costly metamorphosis. Her internal conflict (fear of losing herself vs. desire to reunite with Kael) manifests simultaneously in steady hands and trembling breath, avoiding tidy resolution. The final choice—to become the threshold—is earned through decades of character-defining empathy and culminates in a visible cost: the dissolution of her mortal form. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains concrete, contradictory, and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, awe, and devotion manifest through tactile choices (pressing thumb to crack, unfastening locket) rather than diagnostic labels. Her “willing perplexity” operates as a lived philosophy, not abstraction, and her final renunciation of control over time feels earned by the ritual’s sensory logic. The mother-daughter lineage is rendered through concrete artifacts (traced hands, saucer) that shape her emotional arc without sentimentality. No head-hopping or omniscient drift; every perception filters through her cartomancer’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s pacifism is embodied through micro-choices—mending photographs, floating with joy—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her internal conflict (grief vs. compassion) acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries, and her flaws (avoidance of loneliness) compound before resolution. The gravitational-lightness trait ties emotion to action without therapy-speak. Final renunciation isn’t of goal but of solitude, earned by prior integration of shadow and light.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her destitution, her bottled lightning bugs, her tactile engagement with sand and release—all reveal a character defined by quiet sacrifice. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: she seeks understanding, not reward, yet clings to her “luminous archive” until the moment of release. The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost (tears, relinquishing her only treasure). However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; it’s more lyrical yearning than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, consistent, and embodied through precise micro-choices: adjusting the gnomon, crushing the moss, resealing the scroll. His internal contradiction—duty versus rebellion—is enacted without exposition, especially in his “mask of stoic duty” while carrying revolution in his palm. The bronze quill holder functions as both tool and symbol of his dual role, grounding his trait (“calmly inventive”) in tactile action. Cost is felt in the secrecy, risk, and emotional weight of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves from duty to deepened curiosity, rooted in consistent traits and embodied emotion. Her precognitive curse generates authentic tension—visions of failure clash with her ritual discipline. The final choice (continuing the work despite cost) is earned through micro-choices: anchoring in breath, pressing her palm to test friction. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from tactile experience, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “furiously tranquil” posture and vibrating muscles convey suppressed urgency without diagnostic labels. Her motivation to map scars feels personal and consistent, driving her ascent and eventual writing. The final choice to write intimate verses (not manifestos) credibly renounces grandiosity in favor of precision, with visible cost: years of silence. However, the transition from sobbing collapse to steady hand risks slight emotional compression, though the darkroom timer’s chime mitigates it as a ritualized pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her mechanical arm, organic eye, and emotional restraint reveal a layered self under pressure. Her motivation (“to turn questions into destinations”) drives concrete micro-choices, especially in aligning the needles. The “diplomatically fierce” trait manifests through action, not label, as she integrates chaos rather than resisting it. Minor deduction: slight over-articulation in the phrase “intellectual fence against ambiguity,” bordering on diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s molting persona is rendered with embodied contradiction—her fear of losing Silas’s resolve clashes with her surrender to transformation. Kael’s presence functions as a crucible, not a prop; their shared history and tactile ritual (the tin, the seed) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final micro-choice—planting the seed as Silas dissolves—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete, poetic, and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—grief transformed into strategic creativity—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict (longing vs. resolve) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—an unplanned encore—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: two years of frozen time, now broken at the price of confronting loss. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile detail (the clock’s warmth, the piano’s resonance).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s empirically whimsical nature is embodied in micro-choices—planting the seed despite doubt, humming a lullaby as method—and her internal contradiction (faith vs. skepticism) drives every action. The climax crystallizes her transformation without epiphany: she integrates data and dream as complementary modes of knowing. Cost is felt in luminous doubt becoming compass, not erased but repurposed. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory immersion (tasting herbs, feeling salt-tears).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his regret, placidity, and yearning emerge through tactile ritual (tracing lace, handling bonsai) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to rewrap the compass and prune the juniper branch enacts earned acceptance, not epiphany. The "cerulean regret" insight arises from witnessed memory, not abstraction, and his slow speech informs rhythm without caricature. Flawed yet coherent, he avoids safety-hedging while remaining humanly limited.
